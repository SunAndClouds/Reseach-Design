REFFLY: Melody-Constrained Lyrics Editing Model,"Songyan Zhao, Bingxuan Li, Yufei Tian, Nanyun Peng","Automatic melody-to-lyric generation aims to produce lyrics that align with a given melody. Although previous work can generate lyrics based on high-level control signals, such as keywords or genre, they often struggle with three challenges: (1) lack of controllability, as prior works are only able to produce lyrics from scratch, with little or no control over the content; (2) inability to generate fully structured songs with the desired format; and (3) failure to align prominent words in the lyrics with prominent notes in the melody, resulting in poor lyrics-melody alignment. In this work, we introduce REFFLY (REvision Framework For Lyrics), the first revision framework designed to edit arbitrary forms of plain text draft into high-quality, full-fledged song lyrics. Our approach ensures that the generated lyrics retain the original meaning of the draft, align with the melody, and adhere to the desired song structures. We demonstrate that REFFLY performs well in diverse task settings, such as lyrics revision and song translation. Experimental results show that our model outperforms strong baselines, such as Lyra (Tian et al. 2023) and GPT-4, by 25% in both musicality and text quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00292v1,2024-08
OnlySportsLM: Optimizing Sports-Domain Language Models with SOTA Performance under Billion Parameters,"Zexin Chen, Chengxi Li, Xiangyu Xie, Parijat Dube","This paper explores the potential of a small, domain-specific language model trained exclusively on sports-related data. We investigate whether extensive training data with specially designed small model structures can overcome model size constraints. The study introduces the OnlySports collection, comprising OnlySportsLM, OnlySports Dataset, and OnlySports Benchmark. Our approach involves: 1) creating a massive 600 billion tokens OnlySports Dataset from FineWeb, 2) optimizing the RWKV architecture for sports-related tasks, resulting in a 196M parameters model with 20-layer, 640-dimension structure, 3) training the OnlySportsLM on part of OnlySports Dataset, and 4) testing the resultant model on OnlySports Benchmark. OnlySportsLM achieves a 37.62%/34.08% accuracy improvement over previous 135M/360M state-of-the-art models and matches the performance of larger models such as SomlLM 1.7B and Qwen 1.5B in the sports domain. Additionally, the OnlySports collection presents a comprehensive workflow for building high-quality, domain-specific language models, providing a replicable blueprint for efficient AI development across various specialized fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00286v1,2024-08
Reframing Data Value for Large Language Models Through the Lens of Plausibility,"Mohamad Rida Rammal, Ruida Zhou, Suhas Diggavi","Data valuation seeks to answer the important question, ""How much is this data worth?"" Existing data valuation methods have largely focused on discriminative models, primarily examining data value through the lens of its utility in training. However, with the push for ever-larger language models, relying on valuation methods that require training becomes increasingly expensive and dependent on specific techniques. We propose an alternative perspective on the data value problem for language models, centering around the plausibility of the data. We posit that data holds lesser value if it can be plausibly generated by the model itself. Starting from some intuitive criteria that align with our notions of valuable data, we develop a novel value function that is computationally tractable and derived from first principles with provable properties. We conduct a theoretical analysis of our value function and evaluate it across multiple scenarios and datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00284v2,2024-08
Simple stochastic processes behind Menzerath's Law,Jiří Milička,"This paper revisits Menzerath's Law, also known as the Menzerath-Altmann Law, which models a relationship between the length of a linguistic construct and the average length of its constituents. Recent findings indicate that simple stochastic processes can display Menzerathian behaviour, though existing models fail to accurately reflect real-world data. If we adopt the basic principle that a word can change its length in both syllables and phonemes, where the correlation between these variables is not perfect and these changes are of a multiplicative nature, we get bivariate log-normal distribution. The present paper shows, that from this very simple principle, we obtain the classic Altmann model of the Menzerath-Altmann Law. If we model the joint distribution separately and independently from the marginal distributions, we can obtain an even more accurate model by using a Gaussian copula. The models are confronted with empirical data, and alternative approaches are discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00279v1,2024-08
Towards a dynamical model of English vowels. Evidence from diphthongisation,"Patrycja Strycharczuk, Sam Kirkham, Emily Gorman, Takayuki Nagamine","Diphthong vowels exhibit a degree of inherent dynamic change, the extent of which can vary synchronically and diachronically, such that diphthong vowels can become monophthongs and vice versa. Modelling this type of change requires defining diphthongs in opposition to monophthongs. However, formulating an explicit definition has proven elusive in acoustics and articulation, as diphthongisation is often gradient in these domains. In this study, we consider whether diphthong vowels form a coherent phonetic category from the articulatory point of view. We present articulometry and acoustic data from six speakers of Northern Anglo-English producing a full set of phonologically long vowels. We analyse several measures of diphthongisation, all of which suggest that diphthongs are not categorically distinct from long monophthongs. We account for this observation with an Articulatory Phonology/Task Dynamic model in which diphthongs and long monophthongs have a common gestural representation, comprising two articulatory targets in each case, but they differ according to gestural constriction and location of the component gestures. We argue that a two-target representation for all long vowels is independently supported by phonological weight, as well as by the nature of historical diphthongisation and present-day dynamic vowel variation in British English.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00275v1,2024-08
Finding frames with BERT: A transformer-based approach to generic news frame detection,"Vihang Jumle, Mykola Makhortykh, Maryna Sydorova, Victoria Vziatysheva","Framing is among the most extensively used concepts in the field of communication science. The availability of digital data offers new possibilities for studying how specific aspects of social reality are made more salient in online communication but also raises challenges related to the scaling of framing analysis and its adoption to new research areas (e.g. studying the impact of artificial intelligence-powered systems on representation of societally relevant issues). To address these challenges, we introduce a transformer-based approach for generic news frame detection in Anglophone online content. While doing so, we discuss the composition of the training and test datasets, the model architecture, and the validation of the approach and reflect on the possibilities and limitations of the automated detection of generic news frames.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00272v1,2024-08
Leveraging a Cognitive Model to Measure Subjective Similarity of Human and GPT-4 Written Content,"Tyler Malloy, Maria José Ferreira, Fei Fang, Cleotilde Gonzalez","Cosine similarity between two documents can be computed using token embeddings formed by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, and used to categorize those documents across a range of uses. However, these similarities are ultimately dependent on the corpora used to train these LLMs, and may not reflect subjective similarity of individuals or how their biases and constraints impact similarity metrics. This lack of cognitively-aware personalization of similarity metrics can be particularly problematic in educational and recommendation settings where there is a limited number of individual judgements of category or preference, and biases can be particularly relevant. To address this, we rely on an integration of an Instance-Based Learning (IBL) cognitive model with LLM embeddings to develop the Instance-Based Individualized Similarity (IBIS) metric. This similarity metric is beneficial in that it takes into account individual biases and constraints in a manner that is grounded in the cognitive mechanisms of decision making. To evaluate the IBIS metric, we also introduce a dataset of human categorizations of emails as being either dangerous (phishing) or safe (ham). This dataset is used to demonstrate the benefits of leveraging a cognitive model to measure the subjective similarity of human participants in an educational setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00269v2,2024-08
"Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Survey of Needs, Techniques, Applications, and Future Direction","Melkamu Mersha, Khang Lam, Joseph Wood, Ali AlShami, Jugal Kalita","Artificial intelligence models encounter significant challenges due to their black-box nature, particularly in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses these challenges by providing explanations for how these models make decisions and predictions, ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness. Existing studies have examined the fundamental concepts of XAI, its general principles, and the scope of XAI techniques. However, there remains a gap in the literature as there are no comprehensive reviews that delve into the detailed mathematical representations, design methodologies of XAI models, and other associated aspects. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review encompassing common terminologies and definitions, the need for XAI, beneficiaries of XAI, a taxonomy of XAI methods, and the application of XAI methods in different application areas. The survey is aimed at XAI researchers, XAI practitioners, AI model developers, and XAI beneficiaries who are interested in enhancing the trustworthiness, transparency, accountability, and fairness of their AI models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00265v1,2024-08
DiverseDialogue: A Methodology for Designing Chatbots with Human-Like Diversity,"Xiaoyu Lin, Xinkai Yu, Ankit Aich, Salvatore Giorgi, Lyle Ungar","Large Language Models (LLMs), which simulate human users, are frequently employed to evaluate chatbots in applications such as tutoring and customer service. Effective evaluation necessitates a high degree of human-like diversity within these simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00262v1,2024-08
MAPWise: Evaluating Vision-Language Models for Advanced Map Queries,"Srija Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Rajgaria, Prerana Khatiwada, Vivek Gupta, Dan Roth","Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at tasks requiring joint understanding of visual and linguistic information. A particularly promising yet under-explored application for these models lies in answering questions based on various kinds of maps. This study investigates the efficacy of VLMs in answering questions based on choropleth maps, which are widely used for data analysis and representation. To facilitate and encourage research in this area, we introduce a novel map-based question-answering benchmark, consisting of maps from three geographical regions (United States, India, China), each containing 1000 questions. Our benchmark incorporates 43 diverse question templates, requiring nuanced understanding of relative spatial relationships, intricate map features, and complex reasoning. It also includes maps with discrete and continuous values, encompassing variations in color-mapping, category ordering, and stylistic patterns, enabling comprehensive analysis. We evaluate the performance of multiple VLMs on this benchmark, highlighting gaps in their abilities and providing insights for improving such models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00255v1,2024-08
Pre-Training Multimodal Hallucination Detectors with Corrupted Grounding Data,"Spencer Whitehead, Jacob Phillips, Sean Hendryx","Multimodal language models can exhibit hallucinations in their outputs, which limits their reliability. The ability to automatically detect these errors is important for mitigating them, but has been less explored and existing efforts do not localize hallucinations, instead framing this as a classification task. In this work, we first pose multimodal hallucination detection as a sequence labeling task where models must localize hallucinated text spans and present a strong baseline model. Given the high cost of human annotations for this task, we propose an approach to improve the sample efficiency of these models by creating corrupted grounding data, which we use for pre-training. Leveraging phrase grounding data, we generate hallucinations to replace grounded spans and create hallucinated text. Experiments show that pre-training on this data improves sample efficiency when fine-tuning, and that the learning signal from the grounding data plays an important role in these improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00238v1,2024-08
Can Large Language Models Address Open-Target Stance Detection?,"Abu Ubaida Akash, Ahmed Fahmy, Amine Trabelsi","Stance detection (SD) identifies the text position towards a target, typically labeled as favor, against, or none. We introduce Open-Target Stance Detection (OTSD), the most realistic task where targets are neither seen during training nor provided as input. We evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) from GPT, Gemini, Llama, and Mistral families, comparing their performance to the only existing work, Target-Stance Extraction (TSE), which benefits from predefined targets. Unlike TSE, OTSD removes the dependency of a predefined list, making target generation and evaluation more challenging. We also provide a metric for evaluating target quality that correlates well with human judgment. Our experiments reveal that LLMs outperform TSE in target generation, both when the real target is explicitly and not explicitly mentioned in the text. Similarly, LLMs overall surpass TSE in stance detection for both explicit and non-explicit cases. However, LLMs struggle in both target generation and stance detection when the target is not explicit.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00222v5,2024-08
ProGRes: Prompted Generative Rescoring on ASR n-Best,"Ada Defne Tur, Adel Moumen, Mirco Ravanelli","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their ability to improve the performance of speech recognizers by effectively rescoring the n-best hypotheses generated during the beam search process. However, the best way to exploit recent generative instruction-tuned LLMs for hypothesis rescoring is still unclear. This paper proposes a novel method that uses instruction-tuned LLMs to dynamically expand the n-best speech recognition hypotheses with new hypotheses generated through appropriately-prompted LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a new zero-shot method for ASR n-best rescoring, which combines confidence scores, LLM sequence scoring, and prompt-based hypothesis generation. We compare Llama-3-Instruct, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4 Turbo as prompt-based generators with Llama-3 as sequence scorer LLM. We evaluated our approach using different speech recognizers and observed significant relative improvement in the word error rate (WER) ranging from 5% to 25%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00217v2,2024-08
Enhancing Document-level Argument Extraction with Definition-augmented Heuristic-driven Prompting for LLMs,"Tongyue Sun, Jiayi Xiao","Event Argument Extraction (EAE) is pivotal for extracting structured information from unstructured text, yet it remains challenging due to the complexity of real-world document-level EAE. We propose a novel Definition-augmented Heuristic-driven Prompting (DHP) method to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in document-level EAE. Our method integrates argument extraction-related definitions and heuristic rules to guide the extraction process, reducing error propagation and improving task accuracy. We also employ the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method to simulate human reasoning, breaking down complex problems into manageable sub-problems. Experiments have shown that our method achieves a certain improvement in performance over existing prompting methods and few-shot supervised learning on document-level EAE datasets. The DHP method enhances the generalization capability of LLMs and reduces reliance on large annotated datasets, offering a novel research perspective for document-level EAE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00214v1,2024-08
Enhancing Event Reasoning in Large Language Models through Instruction Fine-Tuning with Semantic Causal Graphs,"Mazal Bethany, Emet Bethany, Brandon Wherry, Cho-Yu Chiang, Nishant Vishwamitra, Anthony Rios, Peyman Najafirad","Event detection and text reasoning have become critical applications across various domains. While LLMs have recently demonstrated impressive progress in reasoning abilities, they often struggle with event detection, particularly due to the absence of training methods that consider causal relationships between event triggers and types. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for instruction fine-tuning LLMs for event detection. Our method introduces Semantic Causal Graphs (SCGs) to capture both causal relationships and contextual information within text. Building off of SCGs, we propose SCG Instructions for fine-tuning LLMs by focusing on event triggers and their relationships to event types, and employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to help preserve the general reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our evaluations demonstrate that training LLMs with SCG Instructions outperforms standard instruction fine-tuning by an average of 35.69\% on Event Trigger Classification. Notably, our fine-tuned Mistral 7B model also outperforms GPT-4 on key event detection metrics by an average of 31.01\% on Event Trigger Identification, 37.40\% on Event Trigger Classification, and 16.43\% on Event Classification. We analyze the retention of general capabilities, observing only a minimal average drop of 2.03 points across six benchmarks. This comprehensive study investigates multiple LLMs for the event detection task across various datasets, prompting strategies, and training approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00209v1,2024-08
The creative psychometric item generator: a framework for item generation and validation using large language models,"Antonio Laverghetta Jr., Simone Luchini, Averie Linell, Roni Reiter-Palmon, Roger Beaty","Increasingly, large language models (LLMs) are being used to automate workplace processes requiring a high degree of creativity. While much prior work has examined the creativity of LLMs, there has been little research on whether they can generate valid creativity assessments for humans despite the increasingly central role of creativity in modern economies. We develop a psychometrically inspired framework for creating test items (questions) for a classic free-response creativity test: the creative problem-solving (CPS) task. Our framework, the creative psychometric item generator (CPIG), uses a mixture of LLM-based item generators and evaluators to iteratively develop new prompts for writing CPS items, such that items from later iterations will elicit more creative responses from test takers. We find strong empirical evidence that CPIG generates valid and reliable items and that this effect is not attributable to known biases in the evaluation process. Our findings have implications for employing LLMs to automatically generate valid and reliable creativity tests for humans and AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00202v1,2024-08
HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics,"Gueter Josmy Faure, Jia-Fong Yeh, Min-Hung Chen, Hung-Ting Su, Shang-Hong Lai, Winston H. Hsu","Existing research often treats long-form videos as extended short videos, leading to several limitations: inadequate capture of long-range dependencies, inefficient processing of redundant information, and failure to extract high-level semantic concepts. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, a model that simulates episodic memory accumulation to capture action sequences and reinforces them with semantic knowledge dispersed throughout the video. Our work makes two key contributions: First, we develop an Episodic COmpressor (ECO) that efficiently aggregates crucial representations from micro to semi-macro levels, overcoming the challenge of long-range dependencies. Second, we propose a Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) that enhances these aggregated representations with semantic information by focusing on the broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. This addresses the issues of redundancy and lack of high-level concept extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17443v3,2024-08
SYNTHEVAL: Hybrid Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with Synthetic CheckLists,"Raoyuan Zhao, Abdullatif Köksal, Yihong Liu, Leonie Weissweiler, Anna Korhonen, Hinrich Schütze","Traditional benchmarking in NLP typically involves using static held-out test sets. However, this approach often results in an overestimation of performance and lacks the ability to offer comprehensive, interpretable, and dynamic assessments of NLP models. Recently, works like DynaBench (Kiela et al., 2021) and CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020) have addressed these limitations through behavioral testing of NLP models with test types generated by a multistep human-annotated pipeline. Unfortunately, manually creating a variety of test types requires much human labor, often at prohibitive cost. In this work, we propose SYNTHEVAL, a hybrid behavioral testing framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a wide range of test types for a comprehensive evaluation of NLP models. SYNTHEVAL first generates sentences via LLMs using controlled generation, and then identifies challenging examples by comparing the predictions made by LLMs with task-specific NLP models. In the last stage, human experts investigate the challenging examples, manually design templates, and identify the types of failures the taskspecific models consistently exhibit. We apply SYNTHEVAL to two classification tasks, sentiment analysis and toxic language detection, and show that our framework is effective in identifying weaknesses of strong models on these tasks. We share our code in https://github.com/Loreley99/SynthEval_CheckList.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17437v2,2024-08
CLOCR-C: Context Leveraging OCR Correction with Pre-trained Language Models,Jonathan Bourne,"The digitisation of historical print media archives is crucial for increasing accessibility to contemporary records. However, the process of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) used to convert physical records to digital text is prone to errors, particularly in the case of newspapers and periodicals due to their complex layouts. This paper introduces Context Leveraging OCR Correction (CLOCR-C), which utilises the infilling and context-adaptive abilities of transformer-based language models (LMs) to improve OCR quality. The study aims to determine if LMs can perform post-OCR correction, improve downstream NLP tasks, and the value of providing the socio-cultural context as part of the correction process. Experiments were conducted using seven LMs on three datasets: the 19th Century Serials Edition (NCSE) and two datasets from the Overproof collection. The results demonstrate that some LMs can significantly reduce error rates, with the top-performing model achieving over a 60% reduction in character error rate on the NCSE dataset. The OCR improvements extend to downstream tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, with increased Cosine Named Entity Similarity. Furthermore, the study shows that providing socio-cultural context in the prompts improves performance, while misleading prompts lower performance. In addition to the findings, this study releases a dataset of 91 transcribed articles from the NCSE, containing a total of 40 thousand words, to support further research in this area. The findings suggest that CLOCR-C is a promising approach for enhancing the quality of existing digital archives by leveraging the socio-cultural information embedded in the LMs and the text requiring correction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17428v1,2024-08
Facilitating phenotyping from clinical texts: the medkit library,"Antoine Neuraz, Ghislain Vaillant, Camila Arias, Olivier Birot, Kim-Tam Huynh, Thibaut Fabacher, Alice Rogier, Nicolas Garcelon, Ivan Lerner, Bastien Rance, Adrien Coulet","Phenotyping consists in applying algorithms to identify individuals associated with a specific, potentially complex, trait or condition, typically out of a collection of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Because a lot of the clinical information of EHRs are lying in texts, phenotyping from text takes an important role in studies that rely on the secondary use of EHRs. However, the heterogeneity and highly specialized aspect of both the content and form of clinical texts makes this task particularly tedious, and is the source of time and cost constraints in observational studies. To facilitate the development, evaluation and reproductibility of phenotyping pipelines, we developed an open-source Python library named medkit. It enables composing data processing pipelines made of easy-to-reuse software bricks, named medkit operations. In addition to the core of the library, we share the operations and pipelines we already developed and invite the phenotyping community for their reuse and enrichment. medkit is available at https://github.com/medkit-lib/medkit",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00164v1,2024-08
Sequence to Sequence Reward Modeling: Improving RLHF by Language Feedback,"Jiayi Zhou, Jiaming Ji, Juntao Dai, Yaodong Yang","Aligning the behavior of Large language models (LLMs) with human intentions and values remains a critical challenge. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) aligns LLMs by training a reward model (RM) on human preferences and fine-tuning the LLMs to maximize RM feedback. Despite its effectiveness and popularity, RLHF is prone to biased local optimization. It means RM fails to provide feedback that accurately aligns with human preference, causing LLMs to explore unexpected generalizations, and failing to achieve alignment objectives. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) reward modeling} method. Its key insight is that learning from language feedback rather than scalar feedback improves RLHF without additional annotations. We replaced the reward modeling target from binary maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with sequence MLE. This method enables richer and fine-grained language feedback without additional annotations, models, or training stages. Our experiments demonstrated its effectiveness, specifically, reducing the refusal-to-response paradigm in single-turn safety dialogues and the long-response bias in text summarization tasks. We provide further analysis that seq2seq RM improves RLHF performance across 2B and 7B LLMs on 3 NLP tasks, achieving an average win rate of 76.9\%. We further show that seq2seq RM can still improve the performance of RLHF under out-of-distribution prompts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00162v1,2024-08
NDP: Next Distribution Prediction as a More Broad Target,"Junhao Ruan, Abudukeyumu Abudula, Xinyu Liu, Bei Li, Yinqiao Li, Chenglong Wang, Yuchun Fan, Yuan Ge, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu","Large language models (LLMs) trained on next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm have demonstrated powerful capabilities. However, the existing NTP paradigm contains several limitations, particularly related to planned task complications and error propagation during inference. In our work, we extend the critique of NTP, highlighting its limitation also due to training with a narrow objective: the prediction of a sub-optimal one-hot distribution. To support this critique, we conducted a pre-experiment treating the output distribution from powerful LLMs as efficient world data compression. By evaluating the similarity between the $n$-gram distribution and the one-hot distribution with LLMs, we observed that the $n$-gram distributions align more closely with the output distribution of LLMs. Based on this insight, we introduce Next Distribution Prediction (NDP), which uses $n$-gram distributions to replace the one-hot targets, enhancing learning without extra online training time. We conducted experiments across translation, general task, language transfer, and medical domain adaptation. Compared to NTP, NDP can achieve up to +2.97 COMET improvement in translation tasks, +0.61 average improvement in general tasks, and incredible +10.75 average improvement in the medical domain. This demonstrates the concrete benefits of addressing the target narrowing problem, pointing to a new direction for future work on improving NTP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17377v1,2024-08
Assessing Generative Language Models in Classification Tasks: Performance and Self-Evaluation Capabilities in the Environmental and Climate Change Domain,"Francesca Grasso, Stefano Locci","This paper examines the performance of two Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3.5 and Llama2 and one Small Language Model (SLM) Gemma, across three different classification tasks within the climate change (CC) and environmental domain. Employing BERT-based models as a baseline, we compare their efficacy against these transformer-based models. Additionally, we assess the models' self-evaluation capabilities by analyzing the calibration of verbalized confidence scores in these text classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while BERT-based models generally outperform both the LLMs and SLM, the performance of the large generative models is still noteworthy. Furthermore, our calibration analysis reveals that although Gemma is well-calibrated in initial tasks, it thereafter produces inconsistent results; Llama is reasonably calibrated, and GPT consistently exhibits strong calibration. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the utility and effectiveness of generative LMs in addressing some of the planet's most urgent issues, highlighting their strengths and limitations in the context of ecology and CC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17362v1,2024-08
LLMs hallucinate graphs too: a structural perspective,"Erwan Le Merrer, Gilles Tredan","It is known that LLMs do hallucinate, that is, they return incorrect information as facts. In this paper, we introduce the possibility to study these hallucinations under a structured form: graphs. Hallucinations in this context are incorrect outputs when prompted for well known graphs from the literature (e.g. Karate club, Les Mis\'erables, graph atlas). These hallucinated graphs have the advantage of being much richer than the factual accuracy -- or not -- of a statement; this paper thus argues that such rich hallucinations can be used to characterize the outputs of LLMs. Our first contribution observes the diversity of topological hallucinations from major modern LLMs. Our second contribution is the proposal of a metric for the amplitude of such hallucinations: the Graph Atlas Distance, that is the average graph edit distance from several graphs in the graph atlas set. We compare this metric to the Hallucination Leaderboard, a hallucination rank that leverages 10,000 times more prompts to obtain its ranking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00159v2,2024-08
Developing an End-to-End Framework for Predicting the Social Communication Severity Scores of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Jihyun Mun, Sunhee Kim, Minhwa Chung","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong condition that significantly influencing an individual's communication abilities and their social interactions. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical due to the profound impact of ASD's characteristic behaviors on foundational developmental stages. However, limitations of standardized diagnostic tools necessitate the development of objective and precise diagnostic methodologies. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for automatically predicting the social communication severity of children with ASD from raw speech data. This framework incorporates an automatic speech recognition model, fine-tuned with speech data from children with ASD, followed by the application of fine-tuned pre-trained language models to generate a final prediction score. Achieving a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.6566 with human-rated scores, the proposed method showcases its potential as an accessible and objective tool for the assessment of ASD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00158v1,2024-08
Impact of ChatGPT on the writing style of condensed matter physicists,"Shaojun Xu, Xiaohui Ye, Mengqi Zhang, Pei Wang","We apply a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of ChatGPT's release on the writing style of condensed matter papers on arXiv. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant improvement in the English quality of abstracts written by non-native English speakers. Importantly, this improvement remains robust even after accounting for other potential factors, confirming that it can be attributed to the release of ChatGPT. This indicates widespread adoption of the tool. Following the release of ChatGPT, there is a significant increase in the use of unique words, while the frequency of rare words decreases. Across language families, the changes in writing style are significant for authors from the Latin and Ural-Altaic groups, but not for those from the Germanic or other Indo-European groups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17325v1,2024-08
Modularity in Transformers: Investigating Neuron Separability & Specialization,"Nicholas Pochinkov, Thomas Jones, Mohammed Rashidur Rahman","Transformer models are increasingly prevalent in various applications, yet our understanding of their internal workings remains limited. This paper investigates the modularity and task specialization of neurons within transformer architectures, focusing on both vision (ViT) and language (Mistral 7B) models. Using a combination of selective pruning and MoEfication clustering techniques, we analyze the overlap and specialization of neurons across different tasks and data subsets. Our findings reveal evidence of task-specific neuron clusters, with varying degrees of overlap between related tasks. We observe that neuron importance patterns persist to some extent even in randomly initialized models, suggesting an inherent structure that training refines. Additionally, we find that neuron clusters identified through MoEfication correspond more strongly to task-specific neurons in earlier and later layers of the models. This work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of transformer internals and offers insights into potential avenues for improving model interpretability and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17324v1,2024-08
Investigating Neuron Ablation in Attention Heads: The Case for Peak Activation Centering,"Nicholas Pochinkov, Ben Pasero, Skylar Shibayama","The use of transformer-based models is growing rapidly throughout society. With this growth, it is important to understand how they work, and in particular, how the attention mechanisms represent concepts. Though there are many interpretability methods, many look at models through their neuronal activations, which are poorly understood. We describe different lenses through which to view neuron activations, and investigate the effectiveness in language models and vision transformers through various methods of neural ablation: zero ablation, mean ablation, activation resampling, and a novel approach we term 'peak ablation'. Through experimental analysis, we find that in different regimes and models, each method can offer the lowest degradation of model performance compared to other methods, with resampling usually causing the most significant performance deterioration.

Bridging Domain Knowledge and Process Discovery Using Large Language Models,"Ali Norouzifar, Humam Kourani, Marcus Dees, Wil van der Aalst","Discovering good process models is essential for different process analysis tasks such as conformance checking and process improvements. Automated process discovery methods often overlook valuable domain knowledge. This knowledge, including insights from domain experts and detailed process documentation, remains largely untapped during process discovery. This paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate such knowledge directly into process discovery. We use rules derived from LLMs to guide model construction, ensuring alignment with both domain knowledge and actual process executions. By integrating LLMs, we create a bridge between process knowledge expressed in natural language and the discovery of robust process models, advancing process discovery methodologies significantly. To showcase the usability of our framework, we conducted a case study with the UWV employee insurance agency, demonstrating its practical benefits and effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17316v1,2024-08
Towards Tailored Recovery of Lexical Diversity in Literary Machine Translation,"Esther Ploeger, Huiyuan Lai, Rik van Noord, Antonio Toral","Machine translations are found to be lexically poorer than human translations. The loss of lexical diversity through MT poses an issue in the automatic translation of literature, where it matters not only what is written, but also how it is written. Current methods for increasing lexical diversity in MT are rigid. Yet, as we demonstrate, the degree of lexical diversity can vary considerably across different novels. Thus, rather than aiming for the rigid increase of lexical diversity, we reframe the task as recovering what is lost in the machine translation process. We propose a novel approach that consists of reranking translation candidates with a classifier that distinguishes between original and translated text. We evaluate our approach on 31 English-to-Dutch book translations, and find that, for certain books, our approach retrieves lexical diversity scores that are close to human translation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17308v1,2024-08

"""Is This It?"": Towards Ecologically Valid Benchmarks for Situated Collaboration","Dan Bohus, Sean Andrist, Yuwei Bao, Eric Horvitz, Ann Paradiso","We report initial work towards constructing ecologically valid benchmarks to assess the capabilities of large multimodal models for engaging in situated collaboration. In contrast to existing benchmarks, in which question-answer pairs are generated post hoc over preexisting or synthetic datasets via templates, human annotators, or large language models (LLMs), we propose and investigate an interactive system-driven approach, where the questions are generated by users in context, during their interactions with an end-to-end situated AI system. We illustrate how the questions that arise are different in form and content from questions typically found in existing embodied question answering (EQA) benchmarks and discuss new real-world challenge problems brought to the fore.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10525v1,2024-08
Speaker Tagging Correction With Non-Autoregressive Language Models,"Grigor Kirakosyan, Davit Karamyan","Speech applications dealing with conversations require not only recognizing the spoken words but also determining who spoke when. The task of assigning words to speakers is typically addressed by merging the outputs of two separate systems, namely, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and a speaker diarization (SD) system. In practical settings, speaker diarization systems can experience significant degradation in performance due to a variety of factors, including uniform segmentation with a high temporal resolution, inaccurate word timestamps, incorrect clustering and estimation of speaker numbers, as well as background noise.   Therefore, it is important to automatically detect errors and make corrections if possible. We used a second-pass speaker tagging correction system based on a non-autoregressive language model to correct mistakes in words placed at the borders of sentences spoken by different speakers. We first show that the employed error correction approach leads to reductions in word diarization error rate (WDER) on two datasets: TAL and test set of Fisher. Additionally, we evaluated our system in the Post-ASR Speaker Tagging Correction challenge and observed significant improvements in cpWER compared to baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00151v1,2024-08
Improving Extraction of Clinical Event Contextual Properties from Electronic Health Records: A Comparative Study,"Shubham Agarwal, Thomas Searle, Mart Ratas, Anthony Shek, James Teo, Richard Dobson","Electronic Health Records are large repositories of valuable clinical data, with a significant portion stored in unstructured text format. This textual data includes clinical events (e.g., disorders, symptoms, findings, medications and procedures) in context that if extracted accurately at scale can unlock valuable downstream applications such as disease prediction. Using an existing Named Entity Recognition and Linking methodology, MedCAT, these identified concepts need to be further classified (contextualised) for their relevance to the patient, and their temporal and negated status for example, to be useful downstream. This study performs a comparative analysis of various natural language models for medical text classification. Extensive experimentation reveals the effectiveness of transformer-based language models, particularly BERT. When combined with class imbalance mitigation techniques, BERT outperforms Bi-LSTM models by up to 28% and the baseline BERT model by up to 16% for recall of the minority classes. The method has been implemented as part of CogStack/MedCAT framework and made available to the community for further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17181v1,2024-08
Codec Does Matter: Exploring the Semantic Shortcoming of Codec for Audio Language Model,"Zhen Ye, Peiwen Sun, Jiahe Lei, Hongzhan Lin, Xu Tan, Zheqi Dai, Qiuqiang Kong, Jianyi Chen, Jiahao Pan, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo, Wei Xue","Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation. Our code and demo are available (Demo: https://x-codec-audio.github.io Code: https://github.com/zhenye234/xcodec)",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17175v3,2024-08
MaFeRw: Query Rewriting with Multi-Aspect Feedbacks for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models,"Yujing Wang, Hainan Zhang, Liang Pang, Binghui Guo, Hongwei Zheng, Zhiming Zheng","In a real-world RAG system, the current query often involves spoken ellipses and ambiguous references from dialogue contexts, necessitating query rewriting to better describe user's information needs. However, traditional context-based rewriting has minimal enhancement on downstream generation tasks due to the lengthy process from query rewriting to response generation. Some researchers try to utilize reinforcement learning with generation feedback to assist the rewriter, but these sparse rewards provide little guidance in most cases, leading to unstable training and generation results. We find that user's needs are also reflected in the gold document, retrieved documents and ground truth. Therefore, by feeding back these multi-aspect dense rewards to query rewriting, more stable and satisfactory responses can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a novel query rewriting method MaFeRw, which improves RAG performance by integrating multi-aspect feedback from both the retrieval process and generated results. Specifically, we first use manual data to train a T5 model for the rewriter initialization. Next, we design three metrics as reinforcement learning feedback: the similarity between the rewritten query and the gold document, the ranking metrics, and ROUGE between the generation and the ground truth. Inspired by RLAIF, we train three kinds of reward models for the above metrics to achieve more efficient training. Finally, we combine the scores of these reward models as feedback, and use PPO algorithm to explore the optimal query rewriting strategy. Experimental results on two conversational RAG datasets demonstrate that MaFeRw achieves superior generation metrics and more stable training compared to baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17072v2,2024-08
Novel-WD: Exploring acquisition of Novel World Knowledge in LLMs Using Prefix-Tuning,"Maxime Méloux, Christophe Cerisara","Teaching new information to pre-trained large language models (PLM) is a crucial but challenging task. Model adaptation techniques, such as fine-tuning and parameter-efficient training have been shown to store new facts at a slow rate; continual learning is an option but is costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting. This work studies and quantifies how PLM may learn and remember new world knowledge facts that do not occur in their pre-training corpus, which only contains world knowledge up to a certain date. To that purpose, we first propose Novel-WD, a new dataset consisting of sentences containing novel facts extracted from recent Wikidata updates, along with two evaluation tasks in the form of causal language modeling and multiple choice questions (MCQ). We make this dataset freely available to the community, and release a procedure to later build new versions of similar datasets with up-to-date information. We also explore the use of prefix-tuning for novel information learning, and analyze how much information can be stored within a given prefix. We show that a single fact can reliably be encoded within a single prefix, and that the prefix capacity increases with its length and with the base model size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17070v1,2024-08
MultiMath: Bridging Visual and Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models,"Shuai Peng, Di Fu, Liangcai Gao, Xiuqin Zhong, Hongguang Fu, Zhi Tang","The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has spurred extensive research into their domain-specific capabilities, particularly mathematical reasoning. However, most open-source LLMs focus solely on mathematical reasoning, neglecting the integration with visual injection, despite the fact that many mathematical tasks rely on visual inputs such as geometric diagrams, charts, and function plots. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{MultiMath-7B}, a multimodal large language model that bridges the gap between math and vision. \textbf{MultiMath-7B} is trained through a four-stage process, focusing on vision-language alignment, visual and math instruction-tuning, and process-supervised reinforcement learning. We also construct a novel, diverse and comprehensive multimodal mathematical dataset, \textbf{MultiMath-300K}, which spans K-12 levels with image captions and step-wise solutions. MultiMath-7B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models on existing multimodal mathematical benchmarks and also excels on text-only mathematical benchmarks.

In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT4, in automating or assisting emotion annotation. We compare GPT4 with supervised models and or humans in three aspects: agreement with human annotations, alignment with human perception, and impact on model training. We find that common metrics that use aggregated human annotations as ground truth can underestimate the performance, of GPT-4 and our human evaluation experiment reveals a consistent preference for GPT-4 annotations over humans across multiple datasets and evaluators. Further, we investigate the impact of using GPT-4 as an annotation filtering process to improve model training.

Dynamic Self-Consistency: Leveraging Reasoning Paths for Efficient LLM Sampling,"Guangya Wan, Yuqi Wu, Jie Chen, Sheng Li","Self-Consistency (SC) is a widely used method to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by sampling the LLM multiple times and outputting the most frequent solution. Despite its benefits, SC results in significant computational costs proportional to the number of samples generated. Previous early-stopping approaches, such as Early Stopping Self Consistency and Adaptive Consistency, have aimed to reduce these costs by considering output consistency, but they do not analyze the quality of the reasoning paths (RPs) themselves. To address this issue, we propose Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency (RASC), an innovative early-stopping framework that dynamically adjusts the number of sample generations by considering both the output answer and the RPs from Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. RASC assigns confidence scores sequentially to the generated samples, stops when certain criteria are met, and then employs weighted majority voting to optimize sample usage and enhance answer reliability. We comprehensively test RASC with multiple LLMs across varied QA datasets. RASC outperformed existing methods and significantly reduces sample usage by an average of 80% while maintaining or improving accuracy up to 5% compared to the original SC",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17017v2,2024-08
Tool-Assisted Agent on SQL Inspection and Refinement in Real-World Scenarios,"Zhongyuan Wang, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie, Jaein Kim","Recent Text-to-SQL methods leverage large language models (LLMs) by incorporating feedback from the database management system. While these methods effectively address execution errors in SQL queries, they struggle with database mismatches -- errors that do not trigger execution exceptions. Database mismatches include issues such as condition mismatches and stricter constraint mismatches, both of which are more prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a tool-assisted agent framework for SQL inspection and refinement, equipping the LLM-based agent with two specialized tools: a retriever and a detector, designed to diagnose and correct SQL queries with database mismatches. These tools enhance the capability of LLMs to handle real-world queries more effectively. We also introduce Spider-Mismatch, a new dataset specifically constructed to reflect the condition mismatch problems encountered in real-world scenarios.

MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Modeling,"Weijie Liu, Zecheng Tang, Juntao Li, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable success across diverse fields. However, handling long contexts remains a significant challenge for LLMs due to the quadratic time and space complexity of attention mechanisms and the growing memory consumption of the key-value cache during generation. This work introduces MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Generation, a method designed to enhance the capabilities of long-context language modeling by utilizing an external retriever for historical information retrieval. MemLong combines a non-differentiable ``ret-mem'' module with a partially trainable decoder-only language model and introduces a fine-grained, controllable retrieval attention mechanism that leverages semantic-level relevant chunks. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that MemLong consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLMs. More importantly, MemLong can extend the context length on a single 3090 GPU from 4k up to 80k.

UserSumBench: A Benchmark Framework for Evaluating User Summarization Approaches,"Chao Wang, Neo Wu, Lin Ning, Jiaxing Wu, Luyang Liu, Jun Xie, Shawn O'Banion, Bradley Green","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating user summaries from a long list of raw user activity data. These summaries capture essential user information such as preferences and interests, and therefore are invaluable for LLM-based personalization applications, such as explainable recommender systems. However, the development of new summarization techniques is hindered by the lack of ground-truth labels, the inherent subjectivity of user summaries, and human evaluation which is often costly and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce \UserSumBench, a benchmark framework designed to facilitate iterative development of LLM-based summarization approaches. This framework offers two key components: (1) A reference-free summary quality metric. We show that this metric is effective and aligned with human preferences across three diverse datasets (MovieLens, Yelp and Amazon Review). (2) A novel robust summarization method that leverages time-hierarchical summarizer and self-critique verifier to produce high-quality summaries while eliminating hallucination.

A longitudinal sentiment analysis of Sinophobia during COVID-19 using large language models,"Chen Wang, Rohitash Chandra","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated xenophobia, particularly Sinophobia, leading to widespread discrimination against individuals of Chinese descent. Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained deep learning models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The ability of LLMs to understand and generate human-like text makes them particularly useful for analysing social media data to detect and evaluate sentiments. We present a sentiment analysis framework utilising LLMs for longitudinal sentiment analysis of the Sinophobic sentiments expressed in X (Twitter) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show a significant correlation between the spikes in Sinophobic tweets, Sinophobic sentiments and surges in COVID-19 cases, revealing that the evolution of the pandemic influenced public sentiment and the prevalence of Sinophobic discourse. Furthermore, the sentiment analysis revealed a predominant presence of negative sentiments, such as annoyance and denial, which underscores the impact of political narratives and misinformation shaping public opinion. The lack of empathetic sentiment which was present in previous studies related to COVID-19 highlights the way the political narratives in media viewed the pandemic and how it blamed the Chinese community.

We also augment the data to balance the label distribution and adapt the task setting to real world scenarios in which event mentions are expressed as natural language sentences.

Event Extraction for Portuguese: A QA-driven Approach using ACE-2005,"Luís Filipe Cunha, Ricardo Campos, Alípio Jorge","Event extraction is an Information Retrieval task that commonly consists of identifying the central word for the event (trigger) and the event's arguments. This task has been extensively studied for English but lags behind for Portuguese, partly due to the lack of task-specific annotated corpora. This paper proposes a framework in which two separated BERT-based models were fine-tuned to identify and classify events in Portuguese documents. We decompose this task into two sub-tasks. Firstly, we use a token classification model to detect event triggers. To extract event arguments, we train a Question Answering model that queries the triggers about their corresponding event argument roles. Given the lack of event annotated corpora in Portuguese, we translated the original version of the ACE-2005 dataset (a reference in the field) into Portuguese, producing a new corpus for Portuguese event extraction. To accomplish this, we developed an automatic translation pipeline. Our framework obtains F1 marks of 64.4 for trigger classification and 46.7 for argument classification setting, thus a new state-of-the-art reference for these tasks in Portuguese.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16932v1,2024-08
ACE-2005-PT: Corpus for Event Extraction in Portuguese,"Luís Filipe Cunha, Purificação Silvano, Ricardo Campos, Alípio Jorge","Event extraction is an NLP task that commonly involves identifying the central word (trigger) for an event and its associated arguments in text. ACE-2005 is widely recognised as the standard corpus in this field. While other corpora, like PropBank, primarily focus on annotating predicate-argument structure, ACE-2005 provides comprehensive information about the overall event structure and semantics. However, its limited language coverage restricts its usability. This paper introduces ACE-2005-PT, a corpus created by translating ACE-2005 into Portuguese, with European and Brazilian variants. To speed up the process of obtaining ACE-2005-PT, we rely on automatic translators. This, however, poses some challenges related to automatically identifying the correct alignments between multi-word annotations in the original text and in the corresponding translated sentence. To achieve this, we developed an alignment pipeline that incorporates several alignment techniques: lemmatization, fuzzy matching, synonym matching, multiple translations and a BERT-based word aligner. To measure the alignment effectiveness, a subset of annotations from the ACE-2005-PT corpus was manually aligned by a linguist expert. This subset was then compared against our pipeline results which achieved exact and relaxed match scores of 70.55\% and 87.55\% respectively.

This paper presents a novel end-to-end neural coreference resolution system utilizing the CorefUD 1.1 dataset, which spans 17 datasets across 12 languages. The proposed model is based on the standard end-to-end neural coreference resolution system. We first establish baseline models, including monolingual and cross-lingual variations, and then propose several extensions to enhance performance across diverse linguistic contexts. These extensions include cross-lingual training, incorporation of syntactic information, a Span2Head model for optimized headword prediction, and advanced singleton modeling.

Modeling offensive content detection for TikTok,"Kasper Cools, Gideon Mailette de Buy Wenniger, Clara Maathuis","The advent of social media transformed interpersonal communication and information consumption processes. This digital landscape accommodates user intentions, also resulting in an increase of offensive language and harmful behavior. Concurrently, social media platforms collect vast datasets comprising user-generated content and behavioral information. These datasets are instrumental for platforms deploying machine learning and data-driven strategies, facilitating customer insights and countermeasures against social manipulation mechanisms like disinformation and offensive content. Nevertheless, the availability of such datasets, along with the application of various machine learning techniques, to researchers and practitioners, for specific social media platforms regarding particular events, is limited. In particular for TikTok, which offers unique tools for personalized content creation and sharing, the existing body of knowledge would benefit from having diverse comprehensive datasets and associated data analytics solutions on offensive content. While efforts from social media platforms, research, and practitioner communities are seen on this behalf, such content continues to proliferate. This translates to an essential need to make datasets publicly available and build corresponding intelligent solutions. On this behalf, this research undertakes the collection and analysis of TikTok data containing offensive content, building a series of machine learning and deep learning models for offensive content detection. This is done aiming at answering the following research question: ""How to develop a series of computational models to detect offensive content on TikTok?"". To this end, a Data Science methodological approach is considered, 120.423 TikTok comments are collected, and on a balanced, binary classification approach, F1 score performance results of 0.863 is obtained.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16857v2,2024-08
See or Guess: Counterfactually Regularized Image Captioning,"Qian Cao, Xu Chen, Ruihua Song, Xiting Wang, Xinting Huang, Yuchen Ren","Image captioning, which generates natural language descriptions of the visual information in an image, is a crucial task in vision-language research. Previous models have typically addressed this task by aligning the generative capabilities of machines with human intelligence through statistical fitting of existing datasets. While effective for normal images, they may struggle to accurately describe those where certain parts of the image are obscured or edited, unlike humans who excel in such cases. These weaknesses they exhibit, including hallucinations and limited interpretability, often hinder performance in scenarios with shifted association patterns. In this paper, we present a generic image captioning framework that employs causal inference to make existing models more capable of interventional tasks, and counterfactually explainable. Our approach includes two variants leveraging either total effect or natural direct effect. Integrating them into the training process enables models to handle counterfactual scenarios, increasing their generalizability. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method effectively reduces hallucinations and improves the model's faithfulness to images, demonstrating high portability across both small-scale and large-scale image-to-text models.

SAM2Point interprets any 3D data as a series of multi-directional videos, and leverages SAM 2 for 3D-space segmentation, without further training or 2D-3D projection. Our framework supports various prompt types, including 3D points, boxes, and masks, and can generalize across diverse scenarios, such as 3D objects, indoor scenes, outdoor environments, and raw sparse LiDAR. Demonstrations on multiple 3D datasets, e.g., Objaverse, S3DIS, ScanNet, Semantic3D, and KITTI, highlight the robust generalization capabilities of SAM2Point.

PrivacyLens: Evaluating Privacy Norm Awareness of Language Models in Action,"Yijia Shao, Tianshi Li, Weiyan Shi, Yanchen Liu, Diyi Yang","As language models (LMs) are widely utilized in personalized communication scenarios (e.g., sending emails, writing social media posts) and endowed with a certain level of agency, ensuring they act in accordance with the contextual privacy norms becomes increasingly critical. However, quantifying the privacy norm awareness of LMs and the emerging privacy risk in LM-mediated communication is challenging due to (1) the contextual and long-tailed nature of privacy-sensitive cases, and (2) the lack of evaluation approaches that capture realistic application scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PrivacyLens, a novel framework designed to extend privacy-sensitive seeds into expressive vignettes and further into agent trajectories, enabling multi-level evaluation of privacy leakage in LM agents' actions. We instantiate PrivacyLens with a collection of privacy norms grounded in privacy literature and crowdsourced seeds. Using this dataset, we reveal a discrepancy between LM performance in answering probing questions and their actual behavior when executing user instructions in an agent setup. State-of-the-art LMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B, leak sensitive information in 25.68% and 38.69% of cases, even when prompted with privacy-enhancing instructions. We also demonstrate the dynamic nature of PrivacyLens by extending each seed into multiple trajectories to red-team LM privacy leakage risk. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/SALT-NLP/PrivacyLens.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00138v2,2024-08
How Well Do LLMs Handle Cantonese? Benchmarking Cantonese Capabilities of Large Language Models,"Jiyue Jiang, Pengan Chen, Liheng Chen, Sheng Wang, Qinghang Bao, Lingpeng Kong, Yu Li, Chuan Wu","The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the competitive landscape in natural language processing (NLP), particularly for English and other data-rich languages. However, underrepresented languages like Cantonese, spoken by over 85 million people, face significant development gaps, which is particularly concerning given the economic significance of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, and in substantial Cantonese-speaking populations in places like Singapore and North America. Despite its wide use, Cantonese has scant representation in NLP research, especially compared to other languages from similarly developed regions. To bridge these gaps, we outline current Cantonese NLP methods and introduce new benchmarks designed to evaluate LLM performance in factual generation, mathematical logic, complex reasoning, and general knowledge in Cantonese, which aim to advance open-source Cantonese LLM technology. We also propose future research directions and recommended models to enhance Cantonese LLM development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16756v2,2024-08
Reinforcement Learning without Human Feedback for Last Mile Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models,Alec Solway,"Reinforcement learning is used to align language models with human preference signals after first pre-training the model to predict the next token of text within a large corpus using likelihood maximization. Before being deployed in a specific domain, models are often further fine-tuned on task specific data. Since human preferences are often unavailable for the last step, it is performed using likelihood maximization as that is the typical default method. However, reinforcement learning has other advantages besides facilitating alignment to a human derived reward function. For one, whereas likelihood maximization is a form of imitation learning in which the model is trained on what to do under ideal conditions, reinforcement learning is not limited to demonstrating actions just for optimally reached states and trains a model what to do under a range of scenarios as it explores the policy space. In addition, it also trains a model what not to do, suppressing competitive but poor actions. This work develops a framework for last-mile fine-tuning using reinforcement learning and tests whether it garners performance gains. The experiments center on abstractive summarization, but the framework is general and broadly applicable. Use of the procedure produced significantly better results than likelihood maximization when comparing raw predictions. For the specific data tested, the gap could be bridged by employing post-processing of the maximum likelihood outputs. Nonetheless, the framework offers a new avenue for model optimization in situations where post-processing may be less straightforward or effective, and it can be extended to include more complex classes of undesirable outputs to penalize and train against, such as hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16753v1,2024-08
A Gradient Analysis Framework for Rewarding Good and Penalizing Bad Examples in Language Models,"Yi-Lin Tuan, William Yang Wang","Beyond maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the standard objective of a language model (LM) that optimizes good examples probabilities, many studies have explored ways that also penalize bad examples for enhancing the quality of output distribution, including unlikelihood training, exponential maximizing average treatment effect (ExMATE), and direct preference optimization (DPO). To systematically compare these methods and further provide a unified recipe for LM optimization, in this paper, we present a unique angle of gradient analysis of loss functions that simultaneously reward good examples and penalize bad ones in LMs. Through both mathematical results and experiments on CausalDialogue and Anthropic HH-RLHF datasets, we identify distinct functional characteristics among these methods. We find that ExMATE serves as a superior surrogate for MLE, and that combining DPO with ExMATE instead of MLE further enhances both the statistical (5-7%) and generative (+18% win rate) performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16751v1,2024-08
"Assessing Large Language Models for Online Extremism Research: Identification, Explanation, and New Knowledge","Beidi Dong, Jin R. Lee, Ziwei Zhu, Balassubramanian Srinivasan","The United States has experienced a significant increase in violent extremism, prompting the need for automated tools to detect and limit the spread of extremist ideology online. This study evaluates the performance of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) in detecting and classifying online domestic extremist posts. We collected social media posts containing ""far-right"" and ""far-left"" ideological keywords and manually labeled them as extremist or non-extremist. Extremist posts were further classified into one or more of five contributing elements of extremism based on a working definitional framework. The BERT model's performance was evaluated based on training data size and knowledge transfer between categories. We also compared the performance of GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 models using different prompts: na\""ive, layperson-definition, role-playing, and professional-definition. Results showed that the best performing GPT models outperformed the best performing BERT models, with more detailed prompts generally yielding better results. However, overly complex prompts may impair performance. Different versions of GPT have unique sensitives to what they consider extremist. GPT 3.5 performed better at classifying far-left extremist posts, while GPT 4 performed better at classifying far-right extremist posts. Large language models, represented by GPT models, hold significant potential for online extremism classification tasks, surpassing traditional BERT models in a zero-shot setting. Future research should explore human-computer interactions in optimizing GPT models for extremist detection and classification tasks to develop more efficient (e.g., quicker, less effort) and effective (e.g., fewer errors or mistakes) methods for identifying extremist content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16749v1,2024-08
Theoretical and Methodological Framework for Studying Texts Produced by Large Language Models,Jiří Milička,"This paper addresses the conceptual, methodological and technical challenges in studying large language models (LLMs) and the texts they produce from a quantitative linguistics perspective. It builds on a theoretical framework that distinguishes between the LLM as a substrate and the entities the model simulates. The paper advocates for a strictly non-anthropomorphic approach to models while cautiously applying methodologies used in studying human linguistic behavior to the simulated entities. While natural language processing researchers focus on the models themselves, their architecture, evaluation, and methods for improving performance, we as quantitative linguists should strive to build a robust theory concerning the characteristics of texts produced by LLMs, how they differ from human-produced texts, and the properties of simulated entities. Additionally, we should explore the potential of LLMs as an instrument for studying human culture, of which language is an integral part.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16740v1,2024-08
"Smaller, Weaker, Yet Better: Training LLM Reasoners via Compute-Optimal Sampling","Hritik Bansal, Arian Hosseini, Rishabh Agarwal, Vinh Q. Tran, Mehran Kazemi","Training on high-quality synthetic data from strong language models (LMs) is a common strategy to improve the reasoning performance of LMs. In this work, we revisit whether this strategy is compute-optimal under a fixed inference budget (e.g., FLOPs). To do so, we investigate the trade-offs between generating synthetic data using a stronger but more expensive (SE) model versus a weaker but cheaper (WC) model. We evaluate the generated data across three key metrics: coverage, diversity, and false positive rate, and show that the data from WC models may have higher coverage and diversity, but also exhibit higher false positive rates. We then finetune LMs on data from SE and WC models in different settings: knowledge distillation, self-improvement, and a novel weak-to-strong improvement setup where a weaker LM teaches reasoning to a stronger LM. Our findings reveal that models finetuned on WC-generated data consistently outperform those trained on SE-generated data across multiple benchmarks and multiple choices of WC and SE models. These results challenge the prevailing practice of relying on SE models for synthetic data generation, suggesting that WC may be the compute-optimal approach for training advanced LM reasoners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16737v2,2024-08
Emerging Vulnerabilities in Frontier Models: Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks,"Tom Gibbs, Ethan Kosak-Hine, George Ingebretsen, Jason Zhang, Julius Broomfield, Sara Pieri, Reihaneh Iranmanesh, Reihaneh Rabbany, Kellin Pelrine","Large language models (LLMs) are improving at an exceptional rate. However, these models are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which are becoming increasingly dangerous as models become increasingly powerful. In this work, we introduce a dataset of jailbreaks where each example can be input in both a single or a multi-turn format. We show that while equivalent in content, they are not equivalent in jailbreak success: defending against one structure does not guarantee defense against the other. Similarly, LLM-based filter guardrails also perform differently depending on not just the input content but the input structure. Thus, vulnerabilities of frontier models should be studied in both single and multi-turn settings; this dataset provides a tool to do so.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00137v1,2024-08
"Mini-Omni: Language Models Can Hear, Talk While Thinking in Streaming","Zhifei Xie, Changqiao Wu","Recent advances in language models have achieved significant progress. GPT-4o, as a new milestone, has enabled real-time conversations with humans, demonstrating near-human natural fluency. Such human-computer interaction necessitates models with the capability to perform reasoning directly with the audio modality and generate output in streaming. However, this remains beyond the reach of current academic models, as they typically depend on extra TTS systems for speech synthesis, resulting in undesirable latency. This paper introduces the Mini-Omni, an audio-based end-to-end conversational model, capable of real-time speech interaction. To achieve this capability, we propose a text-instructed speech generation method, along with batch-parallel strategies during inference to further boost the performance. Our method also helps to retain the original model's language capabilities with minimal degradation, enabling other works to establish real-time interaction capabilities. We call this training method ""Any Model Can Talk"". We also introduce the VoiceAssistant-400K dataset to fine-tune models optimized for speech output. To our best knowledge, Mini-Omni is the first fully end-to-end, open-source model for real-time speech interaction, offering valuable potential for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16725v3,2024-08

ColBERT's late interaction scoring approximates the joint query-document attention seen in cross-encoders while maintaining inference efficiency closer to traditional dense retrieval models, thanks to its bi-encoder architecture and recent optimizations in indexing and search. In this work we propose a number of incremental improvements to the ColBERT model architecture and training pipeline, using methods shown to work in the more mature single-vector embedding model training paradigm, particularly those that apply to heterogeneous multilingual data or boost efficiency with little tradeoff. Our new model, Jina-ColBERT-v2, demonstrates strong performance across a range of English and multilingual retrieval tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16672v4,2024-08
Iterative Graph Alignment,"Fangyuan Yu, Hardeep Singh Arora, Matt Johnson","By compressing diverse narratives, LLMs go beyond memorization, achieving intelligence by capturing generalizable causal relationships. However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16667v1,2024-08
United in Diversity? Contextual Biases in LLM-Based Predictions of the 2024 European Parliament Elections,"Leah von der Heyde, Anna-Carolina Haensch, Alexander Wenz","Large language models (LLMs) are perceived by some as having the potential to revolutionize social science research, considering their training data includes information on human attitudes and behavior. If these attitudes are reflected in LLM output, LLM-generated ""synthetic samples"" could be used as a viable and efficient alternative to surveys of real humans. However, LLM-synthetic samples might exhibit coverage bias due to training data and fine-tuning processes being unrepresentative of diverse linguistic, social, political, and digital contexts. In this study, we examine to what extent LLM-based predictions of public opinion exhibit context-dependent biases by predicting voting behavior in the 2024 European Parliament elections using a state-of-the-art LLM. We prompt GPT-4-Turbo with anonymized individual-level background information, varying prompt content and language, ask the LLM to predict each person's voting behavior, and compare the weighted aggregates to the real election results. Our findings emphasize the limited applicability of LLM-synthetic samples to public opinion prediction. We show that (1) the LLM-based prediction of future voting behavior largely fails, (2) prediction accuracy is unequally distributed across national and linguistic contexts, and (3) improving LLM predictions requires detailed attitudinal information about individuals for prompting. In investigating the contextual differences of LLM-based predictions of public opinion, our research contributes to the understanding and mitigation of biases and inequalities in the development of LLMs and their applications in computational social science.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09045v1,2024-08
HoneyComb: A Flexible LLM-Based Agent System for Materials Science,"Huan Zhang, Yu Song, Ziyu Hou, Santiago Miret, Bang Liu","The emergence of specialized large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in addressing complex tasks for materials science. Many LLMs, however, often struggle with distinct complexities of material science tasks, such as materials science computational tasks, and often rely heavily on outdated implicit knowledge, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce HoneyComb, the first LLM-based agent system specifically designed for materials science. HoneyComb leverages a novel, high-quality materials science knowledge base (MatSciKB) and a sophisticated tool hub (ToolHub) to enhance its reasoning and computational capabilities tailored to materials science. MatSciKB is a curated, structured knowledge collection based on reliable literature, while ToolHub employs an Inductive Tool Construction method to generate, decompose, and refine API tools for materials science. Additionally, HoneyComb leverages a retriever module that adaptively selects the appropriate knowledge source or tools for specific tasks, thereby ensuring accuracy and relevance. Our results demonstrate that HoneyComb significantly outperforms baseline models across various tasks in materials science, effectively bridging the gap between current LLM capabilities and the specialized needs of this domain. Furthermore, our adaptable framework can be easily extended to other scientific domains, highlighting its potential for broad applicability in advancing scientific research and applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00135v1,2024-08

Predictability maximization and the origins of word order harmony,Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho,"We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16570v5,2024-08
SALSA: Speedy ASR-LLM Synchronous Aggregation,"Ashish Mittal, Darshan Prabhu, Sunita Sarawagi, Preethi Jyothi","Harnessing pre-trained LLMs to improve ASR systems, particularly for low-resource languages, is now an emerging area of research. Existing methods range from using LLMs for ASR error correction to tightly coupled systems that replace the ASR decoder with the LLM. These approaches either increase decoding time or require expensive training of the cross-attention layers. We propose SALSA, which couples the decoder layers of the ASR to the LLM decoder, while synchronously advancing both decoders. Such coupling is performed with a simple projection of the last decoder state, and is thus significantly more training efficient than earlier approaches. A challenge of our proposed coupling is handling the mismatch between the tokenizers of the LLM and ASR systems. We handle this mismatch using cascading tokenization with respect to the LLM and ASR vocabularies. We evaluate SALSA on 8 low-resource languages in the FLEURS benchmark, yielding substantial WER reductions of up to 38%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16542v1,2024-08
CNIMA: A Universal Evaluation Framework and Automated Approach for Assessing Second Language Dialogues,"Rena Gao, Jingxuan Wu, Carsten Roever, Xuetong Wu, Jing Wu, Long Lv, Jey Han Lau","We develop CNIMA (Chinese Non-Native Interactivity Measurement and Automation), a Chinese-as-a-second-language labelled dataset with 10K dialogues. We annotate CNIMA using an evaluation framework -- originally introduced for English-as-a-second-language dialogues -- that assesses micro-level features (e.g.\ backchannels) and macro-level interactivity labels (e.g.\ topic management) and test the framework's transferability from English to Chinese. We found the framework robust across languages and revealed universal and language-specific relationships between micro-level and macro-level features. Next, we propose an approach to automate the evaluation and find strong performance, creating a new tool for automated second language assessment. Our system can be adapted to other languages easily as it uses large language models and as such does not require large-scale annotated training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16518v1,2024-08
LLMs vs Established Text Augmentation Techniques for Classification: When do the Benefits Outweight the Costs?,"Jan Cegin, Jakub Simko, Peter Brusilovsky","The generative large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for data augmentation tasks, where text samples are LLM-paraphrased and then used for classifier fine-tuning. However, a research that would confirm a clear cost-benefit advantage of LLMs over more established augmentation methods is largely missing. To study if (and when) is the LLM-based augmentation advantageous, we compared the effects of recent LLM augmentation methods with established ones on 6 datasets, 3 classifiers and 2 fine-tuning methods. We also varied the number of seeds and collected samples to better explore the downstream model accuracy space. Finally, we performed a cost-benefit analysis and show that LLM-based methods are worthy of deployment only when very small number of seeds is used. Moreover, in many cases, established methods lead to similar or better model accuracies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16502v1,2024-08
Learning from Negative Samples in Generative Biomedical Entity Linking,"Chanhwi Kim, Hyunjae Kim, Sihyeon Park, Jiwoo Lee, Mujeen Sung, Jaewoo Kang","Generative models have become widely used in biomedical entity linking (BioEL) due to their excellent performance and efficient memory usage. However, these models are usually trained only with positive samples--entities that match the input mention's identifier--and do not explicitly learn from hard negative samples, which are entities that look similar but have different meanings. To address this limitation, we introduce ANGEL (Learning from Negative Samples in Generative Biomedical Entity Linking), the first framework that trains generative BioEL models using negative samples. Specifically, a generative model is initially trained to generate positive samples from the knowledge base for given input entities. Subsequently, both correct and incorrect outputs are gathered from the model's top-k predictions. The model is then updated to prioritize the correct predictions through direct preference optimization. Our models fine-tuned with ANGEL outperform the previous best baseline models by up to an average top-1 accuracy of 1.4% on five benchmarks. When incorporating our framework into pre-training, the performance improvement further increases to 1.7%, demonstrating its effectiveness in both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages.

This review, based on an analysis of 484 publications sourced from databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and arXiv, provides an in-depth examination of the current landscape, applications, challenges, and prospects of LLMs in biomedicine, distinguishing itself by focusing on the practical implications of these models in real-world biomedical contexts. Firstly, we explore the capabilities of LLMs in zero-shot learning across a broad spectrum of biomedical tasks, including diagnostic assistance, drug discovery, and personalized medicine, among others, with insights drawn from 137 key studies. Then, we discuss adaptation strategies of LLMs, including fine-tuning methods for both uni-modal and multi-modal LLMs to enhance their performance in specialized biomedical contexts where zero-shot fails to achieve, such as medical question answering and efficient processing of biomedical literature. Finally, we discuss the challenges that LLMs face in the biomedicine domain including data privacy concerns, limited model interpretability, issues with dataset quality, and ethics due to the sensitive nature of biomedical data, the need for highly reliable model outputs, and the ethical implications of deploying AI in healthcare.

In this work, we study whether we can exploit existing knowledge about cultural values at inference time to adjust model responses to cultural value probes. We present a simple and inexpensive method that uses a combination of in-context learning (ICL) and human survey data, and show that we can improve the alignment to cultural values across 5 models that include both English-centric and multilingual LLMs. Importantly, we show that our method could prove useful in test languages other than English and can improve alignment to the cultural values that correspond to a range of culturally diverse countries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16482v1,2024-08
Is text normalization relevant for classifying medieval charters?,"Florian Atzenhofer-Baumgartner, Tamás Kovács","This study examines the impact of historical text normalization on the classification of medieval charters, specifically focusing on document dating and locating. Using a data set of Middle High German charters from a digital archive, we evaluate various classifiers, including traditional and transformer-based models, with and without normalization. Our results indicate that the given normalization minimally improves locating tasks but reduces accuracy for dating, implying that original texts contain crucial features that normalization may obscure. We find that support vector machines and gradient boosting outperform other models, questioning the efficiency of transformers for this use case. Results suggest a selective approach to historical text normalization, emphasizing the significance of preserving some textual characteristics that are critical for classification tasks in document analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16446v1,2024-08

The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of Nucleus Sampling on Mitigating Text Memorization,"Luka Borec, Philipp Sadler, David Schlangen","This work analyses the text memorization behavior of large language models (LLMs) when subjected to nucleus sampling. Stochastic decoding methods like nucleus sampling are typically applied to overcome issues such as monotonous and repetitive text generation, which are often observed with maximization-based decoding techniques. We hypothesize that nucleus sampling might also reduce the occurrence of memorization patterns, because it could lead to the selection of tokens outside the memorized sequence. To test this hypothesis we create a diagnostic dataset with a known distribution of duplicates that gives us some control over the likelihood of memorization of certain parts of the training data. Our analysis of two GPT-Neo models fine-tuned on this dataset interestingly shows that (i) an increase of the nucleus size reduces memorization only modestly, and (ii) even when models do not engage in ""hard"" memorization -- a verbatim reproduction of training samples -- they may still display ""soft"" memorization whereby they generate outputs that echo the training data but without a complete one-by-one resemblance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16345v1,2024-08
Logic Contrastive Reasoning with Lightweight Large Language Model for Math Word Problems,"Ding Kai, Ma Zhenguo, Yan Xiaoran","This study focuses on improving the performance of lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning tasks. We introduce a novel method for measuring mathematical logic similarity and design an automatic screening mechanism to construct a set of reference problems that integrate both semantic and logical similarity. By employing carefully crafted positive and negative example prompts, we guide the model towards adopting sound reasoning logic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize retrieval-enhanced generation for mathematical problem-solving. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a 15.8% improvement over the Chain of Thought approach on the SVAMP dataset and a 21.5 % improvement on the GSM8K dataset. Further application of this method to a large-scale model with 175 billion parameters yields performance comparable to the best results on both aforementioned datasets.

Critic-CoT: Boosting the reasoning abilities of large language model via Chain-of-thoughts Critic,"Xin Zheng, Jie Lou, Boxi Cao, Xueru Wen, Yuqiu Ji, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Debing Zhang, Le Sun","Self-critic has become a crucial mechanism for enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs. However, current approaches mainly involve basic prompts for intuitive instance-level feedback, which resembles System-1 processes and limits the reasoning capabilities. Moreover, there is a lack of in-depth investigations into the relationship between LLM's ability to criticize and its task-solving performance. To address these issues, we propose Critic-CoT, a novel framework that pushes LLMs toward System-2-like critic capability. Through a step-wise CoT reasoning paradigm and the automatic construction of distant-supervision data without human annotation, Critic-CoT enables LLMs to engage in slow, analytic self-critique and refinement, thereby improving their reasoning abilities. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that our enhanced model significantly boosts task-solving performance by filtering out invalid solutions or iterative refinement. Furthermore, we investigate the intrinsic correlation between critique and task-solving abilities within LLMs, discovering that these abilities can mutually reinforce each other rather than conflict.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16326v2,2024-08

Recently, there has been active research aimed at improving reasoning accuracy, particularly by using pretrained language models to ""self-correct"" their mistakes via multi-round prompting. In this paper, we follow this line of work but focus on understanding the usefulness of incorporating ""error-correction"" data directly into the pretraining stage. This data consists of erroneous solution steps immediately followed by their corrections. Using a synthetic math dataset, we show promising results: this type of pretrain data can help language models achieve higher reasoning accuracy directly (i.e., through simple auto-regression, without multi-round prompting) compared to pretraining on the same amount of error-free data. We also delve into many details, such as (1) how this approach differs from beam search, (2) how such data can be prepared, (3) whether masking is needed on the erroneous tokens, (4) the amount of error required, (5) whether such data can be deferred to the fine-tuning stage, and many others.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16293v1,2024-08
Measuring the Accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition Solutions,"Korbinian Kuhn, Verena Kersken, Benedikt Reuter, Niklas Egger, Gottfried Zimmermann","For d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people, captioning is an essential accessibility tool. Significant developments in artificial intelligence (AI) mean that Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is now a part of many popular applications. This makes creating captions easy and broadly available - but transcription needs high levels of accuracy to be accessible. Scientific publications and industry report very low error rates, claiming AI has reached human parity or even outperforms manual transcription. At the same time the DHH community reports serious issues with the accuracy and reliability of ASR. There seems to be a mismatch between technical innovations and the real-life experience for people who depend on transcription. Independent and comprehensive data is needed to capture the state of ASR. We measured the performance of eleven common ASR services with recordings of Higher Education lectures. We evaluated the influence of technical conditions like streaming, the use of vocabularies, and differences between languages. Our results show that accuracy ranges widely between vendors and for the individual audio samples. We also measured a significant lower quality for streaming ASR, which is used for live events. Our study shows that despite the recent improvements of ASR, common services lack reliability in accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16287v1,2024-08
Acceptable Use Policies for Foundation Models,Kevin Klyman,"As foundation models have accumulated hundreds of millions of users, developers have begun to take steps to prevent harmful types of uses. One salient intervention that foundation model developers adopt is acceptable use policies: legally binding policies that prohibit users from using a model for specific purposes. This paper identifies acceptable use policies from 30 foundation model developers, analyzes the use restrictions they contain, and argues that acceptable use policies are an important lens for understanding the regulation of foundation models. Taken together, developers' acceptable use policies include 127 distinct use restrictions; the wide variety in the number and type of use restrictions may create fragmentation across the AI supply chain. Developers also employ acceptable use policies to prevent competitors or specific industries from making use of their models. Developers alone decide what constitutes acceptable use, and rarely provide transparency about how they enforce their policies. In practice, acceptable use policies are difficult to enforce, and scrupulous enforcement can act as a barrier to researcher access and limit beneficial uses of foundation models. Nevertheless, acceptable use policies for foundation models are an early example of self-regulation that have a significant impact on the market for foundation models and the overall AI ecosystem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09041v1,2024-08
Enhancing AI-Driven Psychological Consultation: Layered Prompts with Large Language Models,"Rafael Souza, Jia-Hao Lim, Alexander Davis","Psychological consultation is essential for improving mental health and well-being, yet challenges such as the shortage of qualified professionals and scalability issues limit its accessibility. To address these challenges, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to augment psychological consultation services. Our approach introduces a novel layered prompting system that dynamically adapts to user input, enabling comprehensive and relevant information gathering. We also develop empathy-driven and scenario-based prompts to enhance the LLM's emotional intelligence and contextual understanding in therapeutic settings. We validated our approach through experiments using a newly collected dataset of psychological consultation dialogues, demonstrating significant improvements in response quality. The results highlight the potential of our prompt engineering techniques to enhance AI-driven psychological consultation, offering a scalable and accessible solution to meet the growing demand for mental health support.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16276v1,2024-08
Can AI Replace Human Subjects? A Large-Scale Replication of Psychological Experiments with LLMs,"Ziyan Cui, Ning Li, Huaikang Zhou","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into scientific research, particularly in the social sciences, where understanding human behavior is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promise in replicating human-like responses in various psychological experiments. However, the extent to which LLMs can effectively replace human subjects across diverse experimental contexts remains unclear. Here, we conduct a large-scale study replicating 154 psychological experiments from top social science journals with 618 main effects and 138 interaction effects using GPT-4 as a simulated participant. We find that GPT-4 successfully replicates 76.0 percent of main effects and 47.0 percent of interaction effects observed in the original studies, closely mirroring human responses in both direction and significance. However, only 19.44 percent of GPT-4's replicated confidence intervals contain the original effect sizes, with the majority of replicated effect sizes exceeding the 95 percent confidence interval of the original studies. Additionally, there is a 71.6 percent rate of unexpected significant results where the original studies reported null findings, suggesting potential overestimation or false positives. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLMs as powerful tools in psychological research but also emphasize the need for caution in interpreting AI-driven findings. While LLMs can complement human studies, they cannot yet fully replace the nuanced insights provided by human subjects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00128v2,2024-08
LoraMap: Harnessing the Power of LoRA Connections,"Hyeryun Park, Jeongwon Kwak, Dongsuk Jang, Sumin Park, Jinwook Choi","Fact-checking techniques can mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), a prominent issue in specialized domains. As parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can overcome substantial computational overhead, some studies have explored the integration of multiple LoRAs. While previous studies focus on parallel integration, this paper investigates methods to establish connections among multiple LoRAs. We create three reasoning datasets tailored to fact-checking and fine-tune individual LoRAs, allowing them to view and reason from diverse perspectives. Then, we explore strategies for allocating these reasoning LoRAs and introduce LoraMap, an approach to map connections between them. The results of the fact-checking task demonstrate that the performance of LoraMap is superior to LoraHub, an existing method for integrating LoRAs. LoraMap also outperforms with significantly fewer trainable parameters than LoraConcat, which concatenates LoRAs and further fine-tunes them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16264v2,2024-08
ChatSUMO: Large Language Model for Automating Traffic Scenario Generation in Simulation of Urban MObility,"Shuyang Li, Talha Azfar, Ruimin Ke","Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of handling multi-modal input and outputs such as text, voice, images, and video, are transforming the way we process information. Beyond just generating textual responses to prompts, they can integrate with different software platforms to offer comprehensive solutions across diverse applications. In this paper, we present ChatSUMO, a LLM-based agent that integrates language processing skills to generate abstract and real-world simulation scenarios in the widely-used traffic simulator - Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). Our methodology begins by leveraging the LLM for user input which converts to relevant keywords needed to run python scripts. These scripts are designed to convert specified regions into coordinates, fetch data from OpenStreetMap, transform it into a road network, and subsequently run SUMO simulations with the designated traffic conditions. The outputs of the simulations are then interpreted by the LLM resulting in informative comparisons and summaries. Users can continue the interaction and generate a variety of customized scenarios without prior traffic simulation expertise. For simulation generation, we created a real-world simulation for the city of Albany with an accuracy of 96\%. ChatSUMO also realizes the customizing of edge edit, traffic light optimization, and vehicle edit by users effectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09040v1,2024-08
Making the Most of your Model: Methods for Finetuning and Applying Pretrained Transformers,Davis Yoshida,"This thesis provides methods and analysis of models which make progress on this goal. The techniques outlined are task agnostic, and should provide benefit when used with nearly any transformer LM. We introduce two new finetuning methods which add new capabilities to the models they are used on. The first adds a recurrence mechanism, which removes the fixed-window sized constraint and improves the efficiency of a transformer decoder. The second allows masked language models (MLMs) to be used for initialization of both the encoder and decoder of a non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence transformer, opening up generative applications of models which were previously only used for natural language understanding tasks.   We also introduce two new techniques for improving the quality of predictions of any transformer decoder without additional finetuning. One, hidden state optimization, can be applied to any transformer decoder to improve the quality of predictions at inference time, especially for few-shot classification. The other, conditional beam search, allows practitioners to search for natural language generation (NLG) model outputs with high likelihood while conditioning on the event that the output is not degenerate (e.g. empty, repetitive, etc.).   Finally, we provide theoretical and empirical insights on the divergence of model-likelihood and output quality which has widely been observed in prior work. These insights apply to any model which represents a distribution over text, and apply to language models which are not transformers or even autoregressive. We argue that the NLP community has, to some extent, misunderstood the implications of these findings, and encourage a point of view which has more nuance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16241v1,2024-08
SSDM: Scalable Speech Dysfluency Modeling,"Jiachen Lian, Xuanru Zhou, Zoe Ezzes, Jet Vonk, Brittany Morin, David Baquirin, Zachary Mille, Maria Luisa Gorno Tempini, Gopala Krishna Anumanchipalli","Speech dysfluency modeling is the core module for spoken language learning, and speech therapy. However, there are three challenges. First, current state-of-the-art solutions\cite{lian2023unconstrained-udm, lian-anumanchipalli-2024-towards-hudm} suffer from poor scalability. Second, there is a lack of a large-scale dysfluency corpus. Third, there is not an effective learning framework. In this paper, we propose \textit{SSDM: Scalable Speech Dysfluency Modeling}, which (1) adopts articulatory gestures as scalable forced alignment; (2) introduces connectionist subsequence aligner (CSA) to achieve dysfluency alignment; (3) introduces a large-scale simulated dysfluency corpus called Libri-Dys; and (4) develops an end-to-end system by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs).

M4CXR: Exploring Multi-task Potentials of Multi-modal Large Language Models for Chest X-ray Interpretation,"Jonggwon Park, Soobum Kim, Byungmu Yoon, Jihun Hyun, Kyoyun Choi","The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, especially in large language models (LLMs), has significantly impacted various domains, including healthcare. In chest X-ray (CXR) analysis, previous studies have employed LLMs, but with limitations: either underutilizing the multi-tasking capabilities of LLMs or lacking clinical accuracy. This paper presents M4CXR, a multi-modal LLM designed to enhance CXR interpretation. The model is trained on a visual instruction-following dataset that integrates various task-specific datasets in a conversational format. As a result, the model supports multiple tasks such as medical report generation (MRG), visual grounding, and visual question answering (VQA). M4CXR achieves state-of-the-art clinical accuracy in MRG by employing a chain-of-thought prompting strategy, in which it identifies findings in CXR images and subsequently generates corresponding reports. The model is adaptable to various MRG scenarios depending on the available inputs, such as single-image, multi-image, and multi-study contexts. In addition to MRG, M4CXR performs visual grounding at a level comparable to specialized models and also demonstrates outstanding performance in VQA. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments reveal M4CXR's versatility in MRG, visual grounding, and VQA, while consistently maintaining clinical accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16213v1,2024-08

We develop ReXamine-Global, a LLM-powered, multi-site framework that tests metrics across different writing styles and patient populations, exposing gaps in their generalization. First, our method tests whether a metric is undesirably sensitive to reporting style, providing different scores depending on whether AI-generated reports are stylistically similar to ground-truth reports or not. Second, our method measures whether a metric reliably agrees with experts, or whether metric and expert scores of AI-generated report quality diverge for some sites. Using 240 reports from 6 hospitals around the world, we apply ReXamine-Global to 7 established report evaluation metrics and uncover serious gaps in their generalizability. Developers can apply ReXamine-Global when designing new report evaluation metrics, ensuring their robustness across sites. Additionally, our analysis of existing metrics can guide users of those metrics towards evaluation procedures that work reliably at their sites of interest.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16208v1,2024-08
Benchmarking Japanese Speech Recognition on ASR-LLM Setups with Multi-Pass Augmented Generative Error Correction,"Yuka Ko, Sheng Li, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Tatsuya Kawahara","With the strong representational power of large language models (LLMs), generative error correction (GER) for automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to provide semantic and phonetic refinements to address ASR errors. This work explores how LLM-based GER can enhance and expand the capabilities of Japanese language processing, presenting the first GER benchmark for Japanese ASR with 0.9-2.6k text utterances. We also introduce a new multi-pass augmented generative error correction (MPA GER) by integrating multiple system hypotheses on the input side with corrections from multiple LLMs on the output side and then merging them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the use of LLMs for Japanese GER, which involves second-pass language modeling on the output transcriptions generated by the ASR system (e.g., N-best hypotheses).

Evaluating Computational Representations of Character: An Austen Character Similarity Benchmark,"Funing Yang, Carolyn Jane Anderson","Several systems have been developed to extract information about characters to aid computational analysis of English literature. We propose character similarity grouping as a holistic evaluation task for these pipelines. We present AustenAlike, a benchmark suite of character similarities in Jane Austen's novels. Our benchmark draws on three notions of character similarity: a structurally defined notion of similarity; a socially defined notion of similarity; and an expert defined set extracted from literary criticism.   We use AustenAlike to evaluate character features extracted using two pipelines, BookNLP and FanfictionNLP. We build character representations from four kinds of features and compare them to the three AustenAlike benchmarks and to GPT-4 similarity rankings. We find that though computational representations capture some broad similarities based on shared social and narrative roles, the expert pairings in our third benchmark are challenging for all systems, highlighting the subtler aspects of similarity noted by human readers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16131v1,2024-08
Structured Event Reasoning with Large Language Models,Li Zhang,"Reasoning about real-life events is a unifying challenge in AI and NLP that has profound utility in a variety of domains, while fallacy in high-stake applications could be catastrophic. Able to work with diverse text in these domains, large language models (LLMs) have proven capable of answering questions and solving problems. However, I show that end-to-end LLMs still systematically fail to reason about complex events, and they lack interpretability due to their black-box nature. To address these issues, I propose three general approaches to use LLMs in conjunction with a structured representation of events. The first is a language-based representation involving relations of sub-events that can be learned by LLMs via fine-tuning. The second is a semi-symbolic representation involving states of entities that can be predicted and leveraged by LLMs via few-shot prompting. The third is a fully symbolic representation that can be predicted by LLMs trained with structured data and be executed by symbolic solvers. On a suite of event reasoning tasks spanning common-sense inference and planning, I show that each approach greatly outperforms end-to-end LLMs with more interpretability. These results suggest manners of synergy between LLMs and structured representations for event reasoning and beyond.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16098v1,2024-08

Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents for Trustworthy Social Simulations,"Agnieszka Mensfelt, Kostas Stathis, Vince Trencsenyi","We introduce the Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents (LELMA) framework, a novel approach to enhance the trustworthiness of social simulations that utilize large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have gained attention as agents for simulating human behaviour, their applicability in this role is limited by issues such as inherent hallucinations and logical inconsistencies. LELMA addresses these challenges by integrating LLMs with symbolic AI, enabling logical verification of the reasoning generated by LLMs. This verification process provides corrective feedback, refining the reasoning output. The framework consists of three main components: an LLM-Reasoner for producing strategic reasoning, an LLM-Translator for mapping natural language reasoning to logic queries, and a Solver for evaluating these queries. This study focuses on decision-making in game-theoretic scenarios as a model of human interaction. Experiments involving the Hawk-Dove game, Prisoner's Dilemma, and Stag Hunt highlight the limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 Omni and Gemini 1.0 Pro, in producing correct reasoning in these contexts. LELMA demonstrates high accuracy in error detection and improves the reasoning correctness of LLMs via self-refinement, particularly in GPT-4 Omni.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16081v1,2024-08
Using Large Language Models to Create AI Personas for Replication and Prediction of Media Effects: An Empirical Test of 133 Published Experimental Research Findings,"Leo Yeykelis, Kaavya Pichai, James J. Cummings, Byron Reeves","This report analyzes the potential for large language models (LLMs) to expedite accurate replication of published message effects studies. We tested LLM-powered participants (personas) by replicating 133 experimental findings from 14 papers containing 45 recent studies in the Journal of Marketing (January 2023-May 2024). We used a new software tool, Viewpoints AI (https://viewpoints.ai/), that takes study designs, stimuli, and measures as input, automatically generates prompts for LLMs to act as a specified sample of unique personas, and collects their responses to produce a final output in the form of a complete dataset and statistical analysis. The underlying LLM used was Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5. We generated 19,447 AI personas to replicate these studies with the exact same sample attributes, study designs, stimuli, and measures reported in the original human research. Our LLM replications successfully reproduced 76% of the original main effects (84 out of 111), demonstrating strong potential for AI-assisted replication of studies in which people respond to media stimuli. When including interaction effects, the overall replication rate was 68% (90 out of 133). The use of LLMs to replicate and accelerate marketing research on media effects is discussed with respect to the replication crisis in social science, potential solutions to generalizability problems in sampling subjects and experimental conditions, and the ability to rapidly test consumer responses to various media stimuli. We also address the limitations of this approach, particularly in replicating complex interaction effects in media response studies, and suggest areas for future research and improvement in AI-assisted experimental replication of media effects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16073v1,2024-08

We situate our studies in two-player reference games, and deploy various models for thousands of interactions with human users, while learning from interaction feedback signals. We show dramatic improvements in performance over time, with comprehension-generation coupling leading to performance improvements up to 26% in absolute terms and up to 17% higher accuracies compared to a non-coupled system.

BattleAgentBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Cooperation and Competition Capabilities of Language Models in Multi-Agent Systems,"Wei Wang, Dan Zhang, Tao Feng, Boyan Wang, Jie Tang","Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful and capable of handling complex tasks, e.g., building single agents and multi-agent systems. Compared to single agents, multi-agent systems have higher requirements for the collaboration capabilities of language models. Many benchmarks are proposed to evaluate their collaborative abilities. However, these benchmarks lack fine-grained evaluations of LLM collaborative capabilities. Additionally, multi-agent collaborative and competitive scenarios are ignored in existing works. To address these two problems, we propose a benchmark, called BattleAgentBench, which defines seven sub-stages of three varying difficulty levels and conducts a fine-grained evaluation of language models in terms of single-agent scenario navigation capabilities, paired-agent task execution abilities, and multi-agent collaboration and competition capabilities. We conducted extensive evaluations on leading four closed-source and seven open-source models. Experimental results indicate that API-based models perform excellently on simple tasks but open-source small models struggle with simple tasks. Regarding difficult tasks that require collaborative and competitive abilities, although API-based models have demonstrated some collaborative capabilities, there is still enormous room for improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15971v1,2024-08
"More Text, Less Point: Towards 3D Data-Efficient Point-Language Understanding","Yuan Tang, Xu Han, Xianzhi Li, Qiao Yu, Jinfeng Xu, Yixue Hao, Long Hu, Min Chen","Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the 3D physical world remains a significant challenge. Due to the lack of large-scale 3D-text pair datasets, the success of LLMs has yet to be replicated in 3D understanding. In this paper, we rethink this issue and propose a new task: 3D Data-Efficient Point-Language Understanding. The goal is to enable LLMs to achieve robust 3D object understanding with minimal 3D point cloud and text data pairs. To address this task, we introduce GreenPLM, which leverages more text data to compensate for the lack of 3D data. First, inspired by using CLIP to align images and text, we utilize a pre-trained point cloud-text encoder to map the 3D point cloud space to the text space. This mapping leaves us to seamlessly connect the text space with LLMs. Once the point-text-LLM connection is established, we further enhance text-LLM alignment by expanding the intermediate text space, thereby reducing the reliance on 3D point cloud data. Specifically, we generate 6M free-text descriptions of 3D objects, and design a three-stage training strategy to help LLMs better explore the intrinsic connections between different modalities. To achieve efficient modality alignment, we design a zero-parameter cross-attention module for token pooling. Extensive experimental results show that GreenPLM requires only 12% of the 3D training data used by existing state-of-the-art models to achieve superior 3D understanding. Remarkably, GreenPLM also achieves competitive performance using text-only data.

Leveraging Large Language Models for Wireless Symbol Detection via In-Context Learning,"Momin Abbas, Koushik Kar, Tianyi Chen","Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in tackling challenging tasks in wireless systems, especially when an accurate wireless model is not available. However, when available data is limited, traditional DNNs often yield subpar results due to underfitting. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) exemplified by GPT-3, have remarkably showcased their capabilities across a broad range of natural language processing tasks. But whether and how LLMs can benefit challenging non-language tasks in wireless systems is unexplored. In this work, we propose to leverage the in-context learning ability (a.k.a. prompting) of LLMs to solve wireless tasks in the low data regime without any training or fine-tuning, unlike DNNs which require training. We further demonstrate that the performance of LLMs varies significantly when employed with different prompt templates. To solve this issue, we employ the latest LLM calibration methods. Our results reveal that using LLMs via ICL methods generally outperforms traditional DNNs on the symbol demodulation task and yields highly confident predictions when coupled with calibration techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00124v2,2024-08
Leveraging Open Knowledge for Advancing Task Expertise in Large Language Models,"Yuncheng Yang, Yulei Qin, Tong Wu, Zihan Xu, Gang Li, Pengcheng Guo, Hang Shao, Yuchen Shi, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Jie Yang, Yun Gu","The cultivation of expertise for large language models (LLMs) to solve tasks of specific areas often requires special-purpose tuning with calibrated behaviors on the expected stable outputs. To avoid huge cost brought by manual preparation of instruction datasets and training resources up to hundreds of hours, the exploitation of open knowledge including a wealth of low rank adaptation (LoRA) models and instruction datasets serves as a good starting point. However, existing methods on model and data selection focus on the performance of general-purpose capabilities while neglecting the knowledge gap exposed in domain-specific deployment. In the present study, we propose to bridge such gap by introducing few human-annotated samples (i.e., K-shot) for advancing task expertise of LLMs with open knowledge. Specifically, we develop an efficient and scalable pipeline to cost-efficiently produce task experts where K-shot data intervene in selecting the most promising expert candidates and the task-relevant instructions. A mixture-of-expert (MoE) system is built to make the best use of individual-yet-complementary knowledge between multiple experts. We unveil the two keys to the success of a MoE system, 1) the abidance by K-shot, and 2) the insistence on diversity. For the former, we ensure that models that truly possess problem-solving abilities on K-shot are selected rather than those blind guessers. Besides, during data selection, instructions that share task-relevant contexts with K-shot are prioritized. For the latter, we highlight the diversity of constituting experts and that of the fine-tuning instructions throughout the model and data selection process. Extensive experimental results confirm the superiority of our approach over existing methods on utilization of open knowledge across various tasks. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/Yaphabates/Rocket.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15915v2,2024-08
LLM-Based Multi-Hop Question Answering with Knowledge Graph Integration in Evolving Environments,"Ruirui Chen, Weifeng Jiang, Chengwei Qin, Ishaan Singh Rawal, Cheston Tan, Dongkyu Choi, Bo Xiong, Bo Ai","The important challenge of keeping knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) up-to-date has led to the development of various methods for incorporating new facts. However, existing methods for such knowledge editing still face difficulties with multi-hop questions that require accurate fact identification and sequential logical reasoning, particularly among numerous fact updates. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Graph Memory-based Editing for Large Language Models (GMeLLo), a straightforward and effective method that merges the explicit knowledge representation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with the linguistic flexibility of LLMs. Beyond merely leveraging LLMs for question answering, GMeLLo employs these models to convert free-form language into structured queries and fact triples, facilitating seamless interaction with KGs for rapid updates and precise multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that GMeLLo significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge editing methods in the multi-hop question answering benchmark, MQuAKE, especially in scenarios with extensive knowledge edits.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15903v2,2024-08
Nexus: Specialization meets Adaptability for Efficiently Training Mixture of Experts,"Nikolas Gritsch, Qizhen Zhang, Acyr Locatelli, Sara Hooker, Ahmet Üstün","Efficiency, specialization, and adaptability to new data distributions are qualities that are hard to combine in current Large Language Models. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has been the focus of significant research because its inherent conditional computation enables such desirable properties. In this work, we focus on ""upcycling"" dense expert models into an MoE, aiming to improve specialization while also adding the ability to adapt to new tasks easily. We introduce Nexus, an enhanced MoE architecture with adaptive routing where the model learns to project expert embeddings from domain representations. This approach allows Nexus to flexibly add new experts after the initial upcycling through separately trained dense models, without requiring large-scale MoE training for unseen data domains. Our experiments show that Nexus achieves a relative gain of up to 2.1% over the baseline for initial upcycling, and a 18.8% relative gain for extending the MoE with a new expert by using limited finetuning data.

However, the lack of annotated data in multiple languages has posed a challenge for researchers. To address this, a deep learning algorithm based on model transfer has been proposed. The algorithm utilizes a dataset consisting of the English portion of CoNLL2009 and a corpus of semantic roles in Persian. To optimize the efficiency of training, only ten percent of the educational data from each language is used. The results of the proposed model demonstrate significant improvements compared to Niksirt et al.'s model. In monolingual mode, the proposed model achieved a 2.05 percent improvement on F1-score, while in cross-lingual mode, the improvement was even more substantial, reaching 6.23 percent. Worth noting is that the compared model only trained two of the four stages of semantic role labeling and employed golden data for the remaining two stages. This suggests that the actual superiority of the proposed model surpasses the reported numbers by a significant margin. The development of cross-lingual methods for semantic role labeling holds promise, particularly in addressing the scarcity of annotated data for various languages. These advancements pave the way for further research in understanding and processing natural language across different linguistic contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15896v1,2024-08
Bias in LLMs as Annotators: The Effect of Party Cues on Labelling Decision by Large Language Models,"Sebastian Vallejo Vera, Hunter Driggers","Human coders are biased. We test similar biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators. By replicating an experiment run by Ennser-Jedenastik and Meyer (2018), we find evidence that LLMs use political information, and specifically party cues, to judge political statements. Not only do LLMs use relevant information to contextualize whether a statement is positive, negative, or neutral based on the party cue, they also reflect the biases of the human-generated data upon which they have been trained. We also find that unlike humans, who are only biased when faced with statements from extreme parties, LLMs exhibit significant bias even when prompted with statements from center-left and center-right parties. The implications of our findings are discussed in the conclusion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15895v1,2024-08
Persuasion Games using Large Language Models,"Ganesh Prasath Ramani, Shirish Karande, Santhosh V, Yash Bhatia","Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as formidable instruments capable of comprehending and producing human-like text. This paper explores the potential of LLMs, to shape user perspectives and subsequently influence their decisions on particular tasks. This capability finds applications in diverse domains such as Investment, Credit cards and Insurance, wherein they assist users in selecting appropriate insurance policies, investment plans, Credit cards, Retail, as well as in Behavioral Change Support Systems (BCSS).   We present a sophisticated multi-agent framework wherein a consortium of agents operate in collaborative manner. The primary agent engages directly with user agents through persuasive dialogue, while the auxiliary agents perform tasks such as information retrieval, response analysis, development of persuasion strategies, and validation of facts. Empirical evidence from our experiments demonstrates that this collaborative methodology significantly enhances the persuasive efficacy of the LLM. We continuously analyze the resistance of the user agent to persuasive efforts and counteract it by employing a combination of rule-based and LLM-based resistance-persuasion mapping techniques.   We employ simulated personas and generate conversations in insurance, banking, and retail domains to evaluate the proficiency of large language models (LLMs) in recognizing, adjusting to, and influencing various personality types. Concurrently, we examine the resistance mechanisms employed by LLM simulated personas. Persuasion is quantified via measurable surveys before and after interaction, LLM-generated scores on conversation, and user decisions (purchase or non-purchase).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15879v2,2024-08
Knowledge Navigator: LLM-guided Browsing Framework for Exploratory Search in Scientific Literature,"Uri Katz, Mosh Levy, Yoav Goldberg","The exponential growth of scientific literature necessitates advanced tools for effective knowledge exploration. We present Knowledge Navigator, a system designed to enhance exploratory search abilities by organizing and structuring the retrieved documents from broad topical queries into a navigable, two-level hierarchy of named and descriptive scientific topics and subtopics.

Automatic Differential Diagnosis using Transformer-Based Multi-Label Sequence Classification,"Abu Adnan Sadi, Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Khan, Lubaba Binte Saber","As the field of artificial intelligence progresses, assistive technologies are becoming more widely used across all industries. The healthcare industry is no different, with numerous studies being done to develop assistive tools for healthcare professionals. Automatic diagnostic systems are one such beneficial tool that can assist with a variety of tasks, including collecting patient information, analyzing test results, and diagnosing patients. However, the idea of developing systems that can provide a differential diagnosis has been largely overlooked in most of these research studies. In this study, we propose a transformer-based approach for providing differential diagnoses based on a patient's age, sex, medical history, and symptoms. We use the DDXPlus dataset, which provides differential diagnosis information for patients based on 49 disease types. Firstly, we propose a method to process the tabular patient data from the dataset and engineer them into patient reports to make them suitable for our research. In addition, we introduce two data modification modules to diversify the training data and consequently improve the robustness of the models. We approach the task as a multi-label classification problem and conduct extensive experiments using four transformer models. All the models displayed promising results by achieving over 97% F1 score on the held-out test set. Moreover, we design additional behavioral tests to get a broader understanding of the models. In particular, for one of our test cases, we prepared a custom test set of 100 samples with the assistance of a doctor. The results on the custom set showed that our proposed data modification modules improved the model's generalization capabilities. We hope our findings will provide future researchers with valuable insights and inspire them to develop reliable systems for automatic differential diagnosis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15827v1,2024-08
Scaling Up Summarization: Leveraging Large Language Models for Long Text Extractive Summarization,"Léo Hemamou, Mehdi Debiane","In an era where digital text is proliferating at an unprecedented rate, efficient summarization tools are becoming indispensable. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successfully applied in various NLP tasks, their role in extractive text summarization remains underexplored. This paper introduces EYEGLAXS (Easy Yet Efficient larGe LAnguage model for eXtractive Summarization), a framework that leverages LLMs, specifically LLAMA2-7B and ChatGLM2-6B, for extractive summarization of lengthy text documents. Instead of abstractive methods, which often suffer from issues like factual inaccuracies and hallucinations, EYEGLAXS focuses on extractive summarization to ensure factual and grammatical integrity. Utilizing state-of-the-art techniques such as Flash Attention and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), EYEGLAXS addresses the computational and resource challenges typically associated with LLMs. The system sets new performance benchmarks on well-known datasets like PubMed and ArXiv. Furthermore, we extend our research through additional analyses that explore the adaptability of LLMs in handling different sequence lengths and their efficiency in training on smaller datasets. These contributions not only set a new standard in the field but also open up promising avenues for future research in extractive text summarization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15801v1,2024-08
Language Adaptation on a Tight Academic Compute Budget: Tokenizer Swapping Works and Pure bfloat16 Is Enough,"Konstantin Dobler, Gerard de Melo","We investigate continued pretraining of LLMs for language adaptation on a tight academic budget: a setting in which only a few GPUs can be used in parallel, for a heavily constrained duration. We focus on adapting Mistral-7B to German or Arabic and evaluate several techniques to improve efficiency and effectiveness in this setting. Our German models adapted on this tight compute budget underperform compared to the base Mistral-7B, while our Arabic models outperform several baselines, showing that for sufficiently well-represented languages, continued pretraining for specialization is not always helpful. Our main findings focus on training precision and tokenizer swapping. Our results show that pure bfloat16 training is a viable alternative to mixed-precision training, while being much faster when only using a few GPUs. Swapping the tokenizer for a specialized one yields more efficient tokenization and is competitive with the original tokenizer, which already contains some German tokens, but did not significantly increase performance for German. Code and model weights are available at on GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15793v1,2024-08
Interactive Agents: Simulating Counselor-Client Psychological Counseling via Role-Playing LLM-to-LLM Interactions,"Huachuan Qiu, Zhenzhong Lan","Virtual counselors powered by large language models (LLMs) aim to create interactive support systems that effectively assist clients struggling with mental health challenges. To replicate counselor-client conversations, researchers have built an online mental health platform that allows professional counselors to provide clients with text-based counseling services for about an hour per session. Notwithstanding its effectiveness, challenges exist as human annotation is time-consuming, cost-intensive, privacy-protected, and not scalable. To address this issue and investigate the applicability of LLMs in psychological counseling conversation simulation, we propose a framework that employs two LLMs via role-playing for simulating counselor-client interactions. Our framework involves two LLMs, one acting as a client equipped with a specific and real-life user profile and the other playing the role of an experienced counselor, generating professional responses using integrative therapy techniques. We implement both the counselor and the client by zero-shot prompting the GPT-4 model. In order to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in simulating counselor-client interactions and understand the disparities between LLM- and human-generated conversations, we evaluate the synthetic data from various perspectives. We begin by assessing the client's performance through automatic evaluations. Next, we analyze and compare the disparities between dialogues generated by the LLM and those generated by professional counselors. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to thoroughly examine the performance of our LLM-based counselor trained with synthetic interactive dialogues by benchmarking against state-of-the-art models for mental health.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15787v1,2024-08
LogicGame: Benchmarking Rule-Based Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models,"Jiayi Gui, Yiming Liu, Jiale Cheng, Xiaotao Gu, Xiao Liu, Hongning Wang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Minlie Huang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across various tasks, showcasing complex problem-solving abilities. Understanding and executing complex rules, along with multi-step planning, are fundamental to logical reasoning and critical for practical LLM agents and decision-making systems. However, evaluating LLMs as effective rule-based executors and planners remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LogicGame, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the comprehensive rule understanding, execution, and planning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional benchmarks, LogicGame provides diverse games that contain a series of rules with an initial state, requiring models to comprehend and apply predefined regulations to solve problems. We create simulated scenarios in which models execute or plan operations to achieve specific outcomes. These game scenarios are specifically designed to distinguish logical reasoning from mere knowledge by relying exclusively on predefined rules. This separation allows for a pure assessment of rule-based reasoning capabilities. The evaluation considers not only final outcomes but also intermediate steps, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance. Moreover, these intermediate steps are deterministic and can be automatically verified. LogicGame defines game scenarios with varying difficulty levels, from simple rule applications to complex reasoning chains, in order to offer a precise evaluation of model performance on rule understanding and multi-step execution. Utilizing LogicGame, we test various LLMs and identify notable shortcomings in their rule-based logical reasoning abilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15778v4,2024-08
A Survey on Evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models,"Jiaxing Huang, Jingyi Zhang","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mimic human perception and reasoning system by integrating powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with various modality encoders (e.g., vision, audio), positioning LLMs as the ""brain"" and various modality encoders as sensory organs. This framework endows MLLMs with human-like capabilities, and suggests a potential pathway towards achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). With the emergence of all-round MLLMs like GPT-4V and Gemini, a multitude of evaluation methods have been developed to assess their capabilities across different dimensions. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive review of MLLM evaluation methods, covering the following key aspects: (1) the background of MLLMs and their evaluation; (2) ""what to evaluate"" that reviews and categorizes existing MLLM evaluation tasks based on the capabilities assessed, including general multimodal recognition, perception, reasoning and trustworthiness, and domain-specific applications such as socioeconomic, natural sciences and engineering, medical usage, AI agent, remote sensing, video and audio processing, 3D point cloud analysis, and others; (3) ""where to evaluate"" that summarizes MLLM evaluation benchmarks into general and specific benchmarks; (4) ""how to evaluate"" that reviews and illustrates MLLM evaluation steps and metrics; Our overarching goal is to provide valuable insights for researchers in the field of MLLM evaluation, thereby facilitating the development of more capable and reliable MLLMs. We emphasize that evaluation should be regarded as a critical discipline, essential for advancing the field of MLLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15769v1,2024-08
Learning Harmonized Representations for Speculative Sampling,"Lefan Zhang, Xiaodan Wang, Yanhua Huang, Ruiwen Xu","Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15766v2,2024-08
Form and meaning co-determine the realization of tone in Taiwan Mandarin spontaneous speech: the case of Tone 3 sandhi,"Yuxin Lu, Yu-Ying Chuang, R. Harald Baayen","In Standard Chinese, Tone 3 (the dipping tone) becomes Tone 2 (rising tone) when followed by another Tone 3. Previous studies have noted that this sandhi process may be incomplete, in the sense that the assimilated Tone 3 is still distinct from a true Tone 2. While Mandarin Tone 3 sandhi is widely studied using carefully controlled laboratory speech (Xu, 1997) and more formal registers of Beijing Mandarin (Yuan and Chen, 2014), less is known about its realization in spontaneous speech, and about the effect of contextual factors on tonal realization. The present study investigates the pitch contours of two-character words with T2-T3 and T3-T3 tone patterns in spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin conversations. Our analysis makes use of the Generative Additive Mixed Model (GAMM, Wood, 2017) to examine fundamental frequency (f0) contours as a function of normalized time. We consider various factors known to influence pitch contours, including gender, speaking rate, speaker, neighboring tones, word position, bigram probability, and also novel predictors, word and word sense (Chuang et al., 2024). Our analyses revealed that in spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin, T3-T3 words become indistinguishable from T2-T3 words, indicating complete sandhi, once the strong effect of word (or word sense) is taken into account. For our data, the shape of f0 contours is not co-determined by word frequency. In contrast, the effect of word meaning on f0 contours is robust, as strong as the effect of adjacent tones, and is present for both T2-T3 and T3-T3 words.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15747v1,2024-08
LM-PUB-QUIZ: A Comprehensive Framework for Zero-Shot Evaluation of Relational Knowledge in Language Models,"Max Ploner, Jacek Wiland, Sebastian Pohl, Alan Akbik","Knowledge probing evaluates the extent to which a language model (LM) has acquired relational knowledge during its pre-training phase. It provides a cost-effective means of comparing LMs of different sizes and training setups and is useful for monitoring knowledge gained or lost during continual learning (CL). In prior work, we presented an improved knowledge probe called BEAR (Wiland et al., 2024), which enables the comparison of LMs trained with different pre-training objectives (causal and masked LMs) and addresses issues of skewed distributions in previous probes to deliver a more unbiased reading of LM knowledge. With this paper, we present LM-PUB- QUIZ, a Python framework and leaderboard built around the BEAR probing mechanism that enables researchers and practitioners to apply it in their work. It provides options for standalone evaluation and direct integration into the widely-used training pipeline of the Hugging Face TRANSFORMERS library. Further, it provides a fine-grained analysis of different knowledge types to assist users in better understanding the knowledge in each evaluated LM.

At the same time, it poses risks (such as bias in AI-generated item content). Responsible AI (RAI) practices aim to mitigate risks associated with AI. This chapter addresses the critical role of RAI practices in achieving test quality (appropriateness of test score inferences), and test equity (fairness to all test takers). To illustrate, the chapter presents a case study using the Duolingo English Test (DET), an AI-powered, high-stakes English language assessment. The chapter discusses the DET RAI standards, their development and their relationship to domain-agnostic RAI principles.

An Evaluation of Sindhi Word Embedding in Semantic Analogies and Downstream Tasks,"Wazir Ali, Saifullah Tumrani, Jay Kumar, Tariq Rahim Soomro","In this paper, we propose a new word embedding based corpus consisting of more than 61 million words crawled from multiple web resources. We design a preprocessing pipeline for the filtration of unwanted text from crawled data. Afterwards, the cleaned vocabulary is fed to state-of-the-art continuous-bag-of-words, skip-gram, and GloVe word embedding algorithms. For the evaluation of pretrained embeddings, we use popular intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation approaches. The evaluation results reveal that continuous-bag-of-words and skip-gram perform better than GloVe and existing Sindhi fastText word embedding on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation approaches",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15720v1,2024-08
ConCSE: Unified Contrastive Learning and Augmentation for Code-Switched Embeddings,"Jangyeong Jeon, Sangyeon Cho, Minuk Ma, Junyoung Kim","This paper examines the Code-Switching (CS) phenomenon where two languages intertwine within a single utterance. There exists a noticeable need for research on the CS between English and Korean. We highlight that the current Equivalence Constraint (EC) theory for CS in other languages may only partially capture English-Korean CS complexities due to the intrinsic grammatical differences between the languages. We introduce a novel Koglish dataset tailored for English-Korean CS scenarios to mitigate such challenges. First, we constructed the Koglish-GLUE dataset to demonstrate the importance and need for CS datasets in various tasks. We found the differential outcomes of various foundation multilingual language models when trained on a monolingual versus a CS dataset. Motivated by this, we hypothesized that SimCSE, which has shown strengths in monolingual sentence embedding, would have limitations in CS scenarios. We construct a novel Koglish-NLI (Natural Language Inference) dataset using a CS augmentation-based approach to verify this. From this CS-augmented dataset Koglish-NLI, we propose a unified contrastive learning and augmentation method for code-switched embeddings, ConCSE, highlighting the semantics of CS sentences. Experimental results validate the proposed ConCSE with an average performance enhancement of 1.77\% on the Koglish-STS(Semantic Textual Similarity) tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00120v2,2024-08
Conan-embedding: General Text Embedding with More and Better Negative Samples,"Shiyu Li, Yang Tang, Shizhe Chen, Xi Chen","With the growing popularity of RAG, the capabilities of embedding models are gaining increasing attention. Embedding models are primarily trained through contrastive loss learning, with negative examples being a key component. Previous work has proposed various hard negative mining strategies, but these strategies are typically employed as preprocessing steps. In this paper, we propose the conan-embedding model, which maximizes the utilization of more and higher-quality negative examples. Specifically, since the model's ability to handle preprocessed negative examples evolves during training, we propose dynamic hard negative mining method to expose the model to more challenging negative examples throughout the training process. Secondly, contrastive learning requires as many negative examples as possible but is limited by GPU memory constraints. Therefore, we use a Cross-GPU balancing Loss to provide more negative examples for embedding training and balance the batch size across multiple tasks. Moreover, we also discovered that the prompt-response pairs from LLMs can be used for embedding training. Our approach effectively enhances the capabilities of embedding models, currently ranking first on the Chinese leaderboard of Massive text embedding benchmark",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15710v2,2024-08
TempoFormer: A Transformer for Temporally-aware Representations in Change Detection,"Talia Tseriotou, Adam Tsakalidis, Maria Liakata","Dynamic representation learning plays a pivotal role in understanding the evolution of linguistic content over time. On this front both context and time dynamics as well as their interplay are of prime importance. Current approaches model context via pre-trained representations, which are typically temporally agnostic. Previous work on modelling context and temporal dynamics has used recurrent methods, which are slow and prone to overfitting. Here we introduce TempoFormer, the first task-agnostic transformer-based and temporally-aware model for dynamic representation learning. Our approach is jointly trained on inter and intra context dynamics and introduces a novel temporal variation of rotary positional embeddings. The architecture is flexible and can be used as the temporal representation foundation of other models or applied to different transformer-based architectures.

StyleRemix: Interpretable Authorship Obfuscation via Distillation and Perturbation of Style Elements,"Jillian Fisher, Skyler Hallinan, Ximing Lu, Mitchell Gordon, Zaid Harchaoui, Yejin Choi","Authorship obfuscation, rewriting a text to intentionally obscure the identity of the author, is an important but challenging task. Current methods using large language models (LLMs) lack interpretability and controllability, often ignoring author-specific stylistic features, resulting in less robust performance overall.   To address this, we develop StyleRemix, an adaptive and interpretable obfuscation method that perturbs specific, fine-grained style elements of the original input text. StyleRemix uses pre-trained Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to rewrite an input specifically along various stylistic axes (e.g., formality and length) while maintaining low computational cost. StyleRemix outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and much larger LLMs in a variety of domains as assessed by both automatic and human evaluation.   Additionally, we release AuthorMix, a large set of 30K high-quality, long-form texts from a diverse set of 14 authors and 4 domains, and DiSC, a parallel corpus of 1,500 texts spanning seven style axes in 16 unique directions",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15666v1,2024-08
Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing Strategy for Mixture-of-Experts,"Lean Wang, Huazuo Gao, Chenggang Zhao, Xu Sun, Damai Dai","For Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, an unbalanced expert load will lead to routing collapse or increased computational overhead. Existing methods commonly employ an auxiliary loss to encourage load balance, but a large auxiliary loss will introduce non-negligible interference gradients into training and thus impair the model performance. In order to control load balance while not producing undesired gradients during training, we propose Loss-Free Balancing, featured by an auxiliary-loss-free load balancing strategy. To be specific, before the top-K routing decision, Loss-Free Balancing will first apply an expert-wise bias to the routing scores of each expert. By dynamically updating the bias of each expert according to its recent load, Loss-Free Balancing can consistently maintain a balanced distribution of expert load. In addition, since Loss-Free Balancing does not produce any interference gradients, it also elevates the upper bound of model performance gained from MoE training. We validate the performance of Loss-Free Balancing on MoE models with up to 3B parameters trained on up to 200B tokens. Experimental results show that Loss-Free Balancing achieves both better performance and better load balance compared with traditional auxiliary-loss-controlled load balancing strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15664v1,2024-08
Harnessing the Intrinsic Knowledge of Pretrained Language Models for Challenging Text Classification Settings,Lingyu Gao,"Text classification is crucial for applications such as sentiment analysis and toxic text filtering, but it still faces challenges due to the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly transformer architectures and large-scale pretraining, have achieved inspiring success in NLP fields. Building on these advancements, this thesis explores three challenging settings in text classification by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge of pretrained language models (PLMs). Firstly, to address the challenge of selecting misleading yet incorrect distractors for cloze questions, we develop models that utilize features based on contextualized word representations from PLMs, achieving performance that rivals or surpasses human accuracy. Secondly, to enhance model generalization to unseen labels, we create small finetuning datasets with domain-independent task label descriptions, improving model performance and robustness. Lastly, we tackle the sensitivity of large language models to in-context learning prompts by selecting effective demonstrations, focusing on misclassified examples and resolving model ambiguity regarding test example labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15650v1,2024-08
"3-in-1: 2D Rotary Adaptation for Efficient Finetuning, Efficient Batching and Composability","Baohao Liao, Christof Monz","Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods effectively adapt large language models (LLMs) to diverse downstream tasks, reducing storage and GPU memory demands. Despite these advantages, several applications pose new challenges to PEFT beyond mere parameter efficiency. One notable challenge involves the efficient deployment of LLMs equipped with multiple task- or user-specific adapters, particularly when different adapters are needed for distinct requests within the same batch. Another challenge is the interpretability of LLMs, which is crucial for understanding how LLMs function. Previous studies introduced various approaches to address different challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, RoAd, which employs a straightforward 2D rotation to adapt LLMs and addresses all the above challenges: (1) RoAd is remarkably parameter-efficient, delivering optimal performance on GLUE, eight commonsense reasoning tasks and four arithmetic reasoning tasks with $<0.1\%$ trainable parameters; (2) RoAd facilitates the efficient serving of requests requiring different adapters within a batch, with an overhead comparable to element-wise multiplication instead of batch matrix multiplication; (3) RoAd enhances LLM's interpretability through integration within a framework of distributed interchange intervention, demonstrated via composition experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00119v2,2024-08

Beyond Levenshtein: Leveraging Multiple Algorithms for Robust Word Error Rate Computations And Granular Error Classifications,"Korbinian Kuhn, Verena Kersken, Gottfried Zimmermann","The Word Error Rate (WER) is the common measure of accuracy for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Transcripts are usually pre-processed by substituting specific characters to account for non-semantic differences. As a result of this normalisation, information on the accuracy of punctuation or capitalisation is lost. We present a non-destructive, token-based approach using an extended Levenshtein distance algorithm to compute a robust WER and additional orthographic metrics. Transcription errors are also classified more granularly by existing string similarity and phonetic algorithms. An evaluation on several datasets demonstrates the practical equivalence of our approach compared to common WER computations. We also provide an exemplary analysis of derived use cases, such as a punctuation error rate, and a web application for interactive use and visualisation of our implementation.

SIaM: Self-Improving Code-Assisted Mathematical Reasoning of Large Language Models,"Dian Yu, Baolin Peng, Ye Tian, Linfeng Song, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu","There is a growing trend of teaching large language models (LLMs) to solve mathematical problems through coding. Existing studies primarily focus on prompting powerful, closed-source models to generate seed training data followed by in-domain data augmentation, equipping LLMs with considerable capabilities for code-aided mathematical reasoning. However, continually training these models on augmented data derived from a few datasets such as GSM8K may impair their generalization abilities and restrict their effectiveness to a narrow range of question types. Conversely, the potential of improving such LLMs by leveraging large-scale, expert-written, diverse math question-answer pairs remains unexplored. To utilize these resources and tackle unique challenges such as code response assessment, we propose a novel paradigm that uses a code-based critic model to guide steps including question-code data construction, quality control, and complementary evaluation. We also explore different alignment algorithms with self-generated instruction/preference data to foster continuous improvement. Experiments across both in-domain (up to +5.7%) and out-of-domain (+4.4%) benchmarks in English and Chinese demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15565v1,2024-08
Boosting Lossless Speculative Decoding via Feature Sampling and Partial Alignment Distillation,"Lujun Gui, Bin Xiao, Lei Su, Weipeng Chen","Lossless speculative decoding accelerates target large language model (LLM) inference by employing a lightweight draft model for generating tree-structured candidates, which are subsequently verified in parallel by the target LLM. Currently, effective approaches leverage feature-level rather than token-level autoregression within the draft model to facilitate more straightforward predictions and enhanced knowledge distillation. In this paper, we reassess these approaches and propose FSPAD (Feature Sampling and Partial Alignment Distillation for Lossless Speculative Decoding), which introduces two straightforward and effective components within the existing framework to boost lossless speculative decoding. Firstly, FSPAD utilizes token embeddings to sample features of the target LLM in high-dimensional space before feeding them into the draft model, due to the inherent uncertainty of the features preventing the draft model from obtaining the specific token output by the target LLM. Secondly, FSPAD introduces partial alignment distillation to weaken the draft model's connection between features and logits, aiming to reduce the conflict between feature alignment and logit confidence during training. Our experiments include both greedy and non-greedy decoding on the largest and smallest models from the Vicuna and LLaMA3-Instruct series, as well as tasks in multi-turn conversation, translation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation. The results show that FSPAD outperforms the state-of-the-art method across all the aforementioned tasks and target LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15562v1,2024-08
WildFeedback: Aligning LLMs With In-situ User Interactions And Feedback,"Taiwei Shi, Zhuoer Wang, Longqi Yang, Ying-Chun Lin, Zexue He, Mengting Wan, Pei Zhou, Sujay Jauhar, Xiaofeng Xu, Xia Song, Jennifer Neville","As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, aligning these models with human preferences has emerged as a critical challenge. Traditional alignment methods, relying on human or LLM annotated datasets, are limited by their resource-intensive nature, inherent subjectivity, and the risk of feedback loops that amplify model biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WildFeedback, a novel framework that leverages real-time, in-situ user interactions to create preference datasets that more accurately reflect authentic human values. WildFeedback operates through a three-step process: feedback signal identification, preference data construction, and user-guided evaluation. We applied this framework to a large corpus of user-LLM conversations, resulting in a rich preference dataset that reflects genuine user preferences. This dataset captures the nuances of user preferences by identifying and classifying feedback signals within natural conversations, thereby enabling the construction of more representative and context-sensitive alignment data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on WildFeedback exhibit significantly improved alignment with user preferences, as evidenced by both traditional benchmarks and our proposed user-guided evaluation. By incorporating real-time feedback from actual users, WildFeedback addresses the scalability, subjectivity, and bias challenges that plague existing approaches, marking a significant step toward developing LLMs that are more responsive to the diverse and evolving needs of their users. In summary, WildFeedback offers a robust, scalable solution for aligning LLMs with true human values, setting a new standard for the development and evaluation of user-centric language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15549v1,2024-08
SciLitLLM: How to Adapt LLMs for Scientific Literature Understanding,"Sihang Li, Jin Huang, Jiaxi Zhuang, Yaorui Shi, Xiaochen Cai, Mingjun Xu, Xiang Wang, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke, Hengxing Cai","Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.   To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.   Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15545v3,2024-08
An Investigation of Warning Erroneous Chat Translations in Cross-lingual Communication,"Yunmeng Li, Jun Suzuki, Makoto Morishita, Kaori Abe, Kentaro Inui","Machine translation models are still inappropriate for translating chats, despite the popularity of translation software and plug-in applications. The complexity of dialogues poses significant challenges and can hinder crosslingual communication. Instead of pursuing a flawless translation system, a more practical approach would be to issue warning messages about potential mistranslations to reduce confusion. However, it is still unclear how individuals perceive these warning messages and whether they benefit the crowd. This paper tackles to investigate this question and demonstrates the warning messages' contribution to making chat translation systems effective.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15543v2,2024-08
LRP4RAG: Detecting Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation,"Haichuan Hu, Yuhan Sun, Quanjun Zhang","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a primary technique for mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, incomplete knowledge extraction and insufficient understanding can still mislead LLMs to produce irrelevant or even contradictory responses, which means hallucinations persist in RAG. In this paper, we propose LRP4RAG, a method based on the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm for detecting hallucinations in RAG. Specifically, we first utilize LRP to compute the relevance between the input and output of the RAG generator. We then apply further extraction and resampling to the relevance matrix. The processed relevance data are input into multiple classifiers to determine whether the output contains hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LRP has been used for detecting RAG hallucinations, and extensive experiments demonstrate that LRP4RAG outperforms existing baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15533v2,2024-08
FedMCP: Parameter-Efficient Federated Learning with Model-Contrastive Personalization,"Qianyi Zhao, Chen Qu, Cen Chen, Mingyuan Fan, Yanhao Wang","With increasing concerns and regulations on data privacy, fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) in federated learning (FL) has become a common paradigm for NLP tasks. Despite being extensively studied, the existing methods for this problem still face two primary challenges. First, the huge number of parameters in large-scale PLMs leads to excessive communication and computational overhead. Second, the heterogeneity of data and tasks across clients poses a significant obstacle to achieving the desired fine-tuning performance. To address the above problems, we propose FedMCP, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method with model-contrastive personalization for FL. Specifically, FedMCP adds two lightweight adapter modules, i.e., the global adapter and the private adapter, to the frozen PLMs within clients. In a communication round, each client sends only the global adapter to the server for federated aggregation. Furthermore, FedMCP introduces a model-contrastive regularization term between the two adapters. This, on the one hand, encourages the global adapter to assimilate universal knowledge and, on the other hand, the private adapter to capture client-specific knowledge. By leveraging both adapters, FedMCP can effectively provide fine-tuned personalized models tailored to individual clients. Extensive experiments on highly heterogeneous cross-task, cross-silo datasets show that FedMCP achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art FL fine-tuning approaches for PLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00116v1,2024-08
Squid: Long Context as a New Modality for Energy-Efficient On-Device Language Models,"Wei Chen, Zhiyuan Li, Shuo Xin, Yihao Wang","This paper presents Dolphin, a novel decoder-decoder architecture for energy-efficient processing of long contexts in language models. Our approach addresses the significant energy consumption and latency challenges inherent in on-device models. Dolphin employs a compact 0.5B parameter decoder to distill extensive contextual information into a memory embedding, substantially reducing the input length for the primary 7B parameter decoder model. Inspired by vision-language models, we repurpose the image embedding projector to encode long textual contexts, effectively treating extended context as a distinct modality. This innovative method enables processing of substantially longer contexts without the typical computational overhead associated with extended input sequences. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a 10-fold improvement in energy efficiency and a 5-fold reduction in latency compared to conventional full-length context processing methods without losing quality of the response. Our work contributes to the development of more sustainable and scalable language models for on-device applications, addressing the critical need for energy-efficient and responsive AI technologies in resource-constrained environments while maintaining the accuracy to understand long contexts. This research has implications for the broader field of natural language processing, particularly in the domain of efficient model design for resource-limited settings. By enabling more sophisticated AI capabilities on edge devices, Dolphin paves the way for advanced language processing in a wide range of applications where computational resources are at a premium. The Dolphin model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/NexaAIDev/Dolphin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15518v2,2024-08
Towards Fully Autonomous Research Powered by LLMs: Case Study on Simulations,"Zhihan Liu, Yubo Chai, Jianfeng Li","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created new opportunities for the automation of scientific research, spanning both experimental processes and computational simulations. This study explores the feasibility of constructing an autonomous simulation agent (ASA) powered by LLM, through sophisticated API integration, to automate the entire research process, from experimental design, remote upload and simulation execution, data analysis, to report compilation. Using a simulation problem of polymer chain conformations as a case study, we assessed the performance of ASAs powered by different LLMs including GPT-4-Turbo. Our findings revealed that ASA-GPT-4o achieved near-flawless execution on designated research missions, underscoring the potential of LLMs to manage complete scientific investigations autonomously. The outlined automation can be iteratively performed up to twenty cycles without human intervention, illustrating the potential of LLMs for large-scale autonomous research endeavors. Additionally, we discussed the intrinsic traits of ASAs in managing extensive tasks, focusing on self-validation mechanisms and the balance between local attention and global oversight.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15512v2,2024-08
"Measuring the Reliability of Causal Probing Methods: Tradeoffs, Limitations, and the Plight of Nullifying Interventions","Marc Canby, Adam Davies, Chirag Rastogi, Julia Hockenmaier","Causal probing aims to analyze foundation models by examining how intervening on their representation of various latent properties impacts their outputs. Recent works have cast doubt on the theoretical basis of several leading causal probing methods, but it has been unclear how to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in practice. To address this, we formally define and quantify two key causal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of the target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little non-targeted properties have been impacted). We introduce an empirical analysis framework to measure and evaluate these quantities, allowing us to make the first direct comparisons of the reliability of different families of causal probing methods (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear or counterfactual vs. nullifying interventions). We find that: (1) there is an inherent tradeoff between completeness and selectivity; (2) no leading probing method is able to consistently satisfy both criteria at once; (3) methods with more favorable tradeoffs have a more consistent impact on LLM behavior; and (4) nullifying interventions are far less complete than counterfactual interventions, suggesting that nullifying methods may not be an effective approach to causal probing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15510v2,2024-08
ReMamba: Equip Mamba with Effective Long-Sequence Modeling,"Danlong Yuan, Jiahao Liu, Bei Li, Huishuai Zhang, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Dongyan Zhao","While the Mamba architecture demonstrates superior inference efficiency and competitive performance on short-context natural language processing (NLP) tasks, empirical evidence suggests its capacity to comprehend long contexts is limited compared to transformer-based models. In this study, we investigate the long-context efficiency issues of the Mamba models and propose ReMamba, which enhances Mamba's ability to comprehend long contexts. ReMamba incorporates selective compression and adaptation techniques within a two-stage re-forward process, incurring minimal additional inference costs overhead. Experimental results on the LongBench and L-Eval benchmarks demonstrate ReMamba's efficacy, improving over the baselines by 3.2 and 1.6 points, respectively, and attaining performance almost on par with same-size transformer models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15496v4,2024-08
Enhancing and Accelerating Large Language Models via Instruction-Aware Contextual Compression,"Haowen Hou, Fei Ma, Binwen Bai, Xinxin Zhu, Fei Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their remarkable performance across various tasks. However, to mitigate the issue of hallucinations, LLMs often incorporate retrieval-augmented pipeline to provide them with rich external knowledge and context. Nevertheless, challenges stem from inaccurate and coarse-grained context retrieved from the retriever. Supplying irrelevant context to the LLMs can result in poorer responses, increased inference latency, and higher costs. This paper introduces a method called Instruction-Aware Contextual Compression, which filters out less informative content, thereby accelerating and enhancing the use of LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that Instruction-Aware Contextual Compression notably reduces memory consumption and minimizes generation latency while maintaining performance levels comparable to those achieved with the use of the full context. Specifically, we achieved a 50% reduction in context-related costs, resulting in a 5% reduction in inference memory usage and a 2.2-fold increase in inference speed, with only a minor drop of 0.047 in Rouge-1. These findings suggest that our method strikes an effective balance between efficiency and performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15491v1,2024-08
Legilimens: Practical and Unified Content Moderation for Large Language Model Services,"Jialin Wu, Jiangyi Deng, Shengyuan Pang, Yanjiao Chen, Jiayang Xu, Xinfeng Li, Wenyuan Xu","Given the societal impact of unsafe content generated by large language models (LLMs), ensuring that LLM services comply with safety standards is a crucial concern for LLM service providers. Common content moderation methods are limited by an effectiveness-and-efficiency dilemma, where simple models are fragile while sophisticated models consume excessive computational resources. In this paper, we reveal for the first time that effective and efficient content moderation can be achieved by extracting conceptual features from chat-oriented LLMs, despite their initial fine-tuning for conversation rather than content moderation. We propose a practical and unified content moderation framework for LLM services, named Legilimens, which features both effectiveness and efficiency. Our red-team model-based data augmentation enhances the robustness of Legilimens against state-of-the-art jailbreaking. Additionally, we develop a framework to theoretically analyze the cost-effectiveness of Legilimens compared to other methods. We have conducted extensive experiments on five host LLMs, seventeen datasets, and nine jailbreaking methods to verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of Legilimens against normal and adaptive adversaries. A comparison of Legilimens with both commercial and academic baselines demonstrates the superior performance of Legilimens. Furthermore, we confirm that Legilimens can be applied to few-shot scenarios and extended to multi-label classification tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15488v2,2024-08
Implicit Geometry of Next-token Prediction: From Language Sparsity Patterns to Model Representations,"Yize Zhao, Tina Behnia, Vala Vakilian, Christos Thrampoulidis","Next-token prediction (NTP) over large text corpora has become the go-to paradigm to train large language models. Yet, it remains unclear how NTP influences the mapping of linguistic patterns to geometric properties of the resulting model representations. We frame training of large language models as soft-label classification over sparse probabilistic label vectors, coupled with an analytical approximation that allows unrestricted generation of context embeddings. This approach links NTP training to rank-constrained, nuclear-norm regularized optimization in the logit domain, offering a framework for analyzing the geometry of word and context embeddings. In large embedding spaces, we find that NTP implicitly favors learning logits with a sparse plus low-rank structure. While the sparse component captures the co-occurrence frequency of context-word pairs, the orthogonal low-rank component, which becomes dominant as training progresses, depends solely on the sparsity pattern of the co-occurrence matrix. Consequently, when projected onto an appropriate subspace, representations of contexts that are followed by the same set of next-tokens collapse, a phenomenon we term subspace-collapse. We validate our findings on synthetic and small-scale real language datasets. Finally, we outline potential research directions aimed at deepening the understanding of NTP's influence on the learning of linguistic patterns and regularities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15417v1,2024-08
"Awes, Laws, and Flaws From Today's LLM Research",Adrian de Wynter,"We perform a critical examination of the scientific methodology behind contemporary large language model (LLM) research. For this we assess over 2,000 research works based on criteria typical of what is considered good research (e.g. presence of statistical tests and reproducibility) and cross-validate it with arguments that are at the centre of controversy (e.g., claims of emergent behaviour, the use of LLMs as evaluators). We find multiple trends, such as declines in claims of emergent behaviour and ethics disclaimers; the rise of LLMs as evaluators in spite of a lack of consensus from the community about their useability; and an increase of claims of LLM reasoning abilities, typically without leveraging human evaluation. This paper underscores the need for more scrutiny and rigour by and from this field to live up to the fundamentals of a responsible scientific method that is ethical, reproducible, systematic, and open to criticism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15409v2,2024-08
Intertwined Biases Across Social Media Spheres: Unpacking Correlations in Media Bias Dimensions,"Yifan Liu, Yike Li, Dong Wang","Media bias significantly shapes public perception by reinforcing stereotypes and exacerbating societal divisions. Prior research has often focused on isolated media bias dimensions such as \textit{political bias} or \textit{racial bias}, neglecting the complex interrelationships among various bias dimensions across different topic domains. Moreover, we observe that models trained on existing media bias benchmarks fail to generalize effectively on recent social media posts, particularly in certain bias identification tasks. This shortfall primarily arises because these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the rapidly evolving nature of social media content, which is characterized by shifting user behaviors and emerging trends. In response to these limitations, our research introduces a novel dataset collected from YouTube and Reddit over the past five years. Our dataset includes automated annotations for YouTube content across a broad spectrum of bias dimensions, such as gender, racial, and political biases, as well as hate speech, among others. It spans diverse domains including politics, sports, healthcare, education, and entertainment, reflecting the complex interplay of biases across different societal sectors. Through comprehensive statistical analysis, we identify significant differences in bias expression patterns and intra-domain bias correlations across these domains. By utilizing our understanding of the correlations among various bias dimensions, we lay the groundwork for creating advanced systems capable of detecting multiple biases simultaneously. Overall, our dataset advances the field of media bias identification, contributing to the development of tools that promote fairer media consumption. The comprehensive awareness of existing media bias fosters more ethical journalism, promotes cultural sensitivity, and supports a more informed and equitable public discourse.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15406v1,2024-08
A Statistical Framework for Data-dependent Retrieval-Augmented Models,"Soumya Basu, Ankit Singh Rawat, Manzil Zaheer","Modern ML systems increasingly augment input instances with additional relevant information to enhance final prediction. Despite growing interest in such retrieval-augmented models, their fundamental properties and training are not well understood. We propose a statistical framework to study such models with two components: 1) a {\em retriever} to identify the relevant information out of a large corpus via a data-dependent metric; and 2) a {\em predictor} that consumes the input instances along with the retrieved information to make the final predictions. We present a principled method for end-to-end training of both components and draw connections with various training approaches in the literature. Furthermore, we establish excess risk bounds for retrieval-augmented models while delineating the contributions of both retriever and predictor towards the model performance. We validate the utility of our proposed training methods along with the key takeaways from our statistical analysis on open domain question answering task where retrieval augmentation is important.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15399v1,2024-08
DualKanbaFormer: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and State Space Model Transformer for Multimodal Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Adamu Lawan, Juhua Pu, Haruna Yunusa, Muhammad Lawan, Aliyu Umar, Adamu Sani Yahya","Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) enhances sentiment detection by combining text with other data types like images. However, despite setting significant benchmarks, attention mechanisms exhibit limitations in efficiently modelling long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion targets within the text. They also face challenges in capturing global-context dependencies for visual representations. To this end, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Selective State Space model (Mamba) transformer (DualKanbaFormer), a novel architecture to address the above issues. We leverage the power of Mamba to capture global context dependencies, Multi-head Attention (MHA) to capture local context dependencies, and KANs to capture non-linear modelling patterns for both textual representations (textual KanbaFormer) and visual representations (visual KanbaFormer). Furthermore, we fuse the textual KanbaFormer and visual KanbaFomer with a gated fusion layer to capture the inter-modality dynamics. According to extensive experimental results, our model outperforms some state-of-the-art (SOTA) studies on two public datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15379v2,2024-08
"Wait, that's not an option: LLMs Robustness with Incorrect Multiple-Choice Options","Gracjan Góral, Emilia Wiśnios, Piotr Sankowski, Paweł Budzianowski","Decision-making under full alignment requires balancing between reasoning and faithfulness - a challenge for large language models (LLMs). This study explores whether LLMs prioritize following instructions over reasoning and truth when given ""misleading"" instructions, such as ""Respond solely with A or B"", even when neither option is correct. We introduce a new metric called ""reflective judgment"", which sheds new light on the relationship between the pre-training and post-training alignment schemes. In tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to domain-specific assessments, models like GPT-4o, o1-mini, or Claude 3 Opus adhered to instructions correctly but failed to reflect on the validity of the provided options. Contrary, models from the Llama 3.1 family (8B, 70B, 405B) or base Qwen2.5 (7B, 14B, 32B) families exhibit improved refusal rates with size, indicating a scaling effect. We also observed that alignment techniques, though intended to enhance reasoning, sometimes weakened the models' ability to reject incorrect instructions, leading them to follow flawed prompts uncritically. Finally, we have also conducted a parallel human study revealing similar patterns in human behavior and annotations. We highlight how popular RLHF datasets might disrupt either training or evaluation due to annotations exhibiting poor reflective judgement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00113v2,2024-08
Pitfalls and Outlooks in Using COMET,"Vilém Zouhar, Pinzhen Chen, Tsz Kin Lam, Nikita Moghe, Barry Haddow","The COMET metric has blazed a trail in the machine translation community, given its strong correlation with human judgements of translation quality. Its success stems from being a modified pre-trained multilingual model finetuned for quality assessment. However, it being a machine learning model also gives rise to a new set of pitfalls that may not be widely known. We investigate these unexpected behaviours from three aspects: 1) technical: obsolete software versions and compute precision; 2) data: empty content, language mismatch, and translationese at test time as well as distribution and domain biases in training; 3) usage and reporting: multi-reference support and model referencing in the literature. All of these problems imply that COMET scores are not comparable between papers or even technical setups and we put forward our perspective on fixing each issue. Furthermore, we release the sacreCOMET package that can generate a signature for the software and model configuration as well as an appropriate citation. The goal of this work is to help the community make more sound use of the COMET metric.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15366v3,2024-08
"UNA: Unifying Alignments of RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO by a Generalized Implicit Reward Function","Zhichao Wang, Bin Bi, Can Huang, Shiva Kumar Pentyala, Zixu James Zhu, Sitaram Asur, Na Claire Cheng","An LLM is pretrained on trillions of tokens, but the pretrained LLM may still generate undesired responses. To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data.   In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15339v2,2024-08
Into the Unknown Unknowns: Engaged Human Learning through Participation in Language Model Agent Conversations,"Yucheng Jiang, Yijia Shao, Dekun Ma, Sina J. Semnani, Monica S. Lam","While language model (LM)-powered chatbots and generative search engines excel at answering concrete queries, discovering information in the terrain of unknown unknowns remains challenging for users. To emulate the common educational scenario where children/students learn by listening to and participating in conversations of their parents/teachers, we create Collaborative STORM (Co-STORM). Unlike QA systems that require users to ask all the questions, Co-STORM lets users observe and occasionally steer the discourse among several LM agents. The agents ask questions on the user's behalf, allowing the user to discover unknown unknowns serendipitously. To facilitate user interaction, Co-STORM assists users in tracking the discourse by organizing the uncovered information into a dynamic mind map, ultimately generating a comprehensive report as takeaways. For automatic evaluation, we construct the WildSeek dataset by collecting real information-seeking records with user goals. Co-STORM outperforms baseline methods on both discourse trace and report quality. In a further human evaluation, 70% of participants prefer Co-STORM over a search engine, and 78% favor it over a RAG chatbot.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15232v2,2024-08
LLM Defenses Are Not Robust to Multi-Turn Human Jailbreaks Yet,"Nathaniel Li, Ziwen Han, Ian Steneker, Willow Primack, Riley Goodside, Hugh Zhang, Zifan Wang, Cristina Menghini, Summer Yue","Recent large language model (LLM) defenses have greatly improved models' ability to refuse harmful queries, even when adversarially attacked. However, LLM defenses are primarily evaluated against automated adversarial attacks in a single turn of conversation, an insufficient threat model for real-world malicious use. We demonstrate that multi-turn human jailbreaks uncover significant vulnerabilities, exceeding 70% attack success rate (ASR) on HarmBench against defenses that report single-digit ASRs with automated single-turn attacks. Human jailbreaks also reveal vulnerabilities in machine unlearning defenses, successfully recovering dual-use biosecurity knowledge from unlearned models. We compile these results into Multi-Turn Human Jailbreaks (MHJ), a dataset of 2,912 prompts across 537 multi-turn jailbreaks. We publicly release MHJ alongside a compendium of jailbreak tactics developed across dozens of commercial red teaming engagements, supporting research towards stronger LLM defenses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15221v2,2024-08
Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization: Balancing Safety-Helpfulness in Language Models,"Wenxuan Zhang, Philip H. S. Torr, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Adel Bibi","Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on human preferences, typically through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has proven successful in enhancing their capabilities. However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during the fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In the supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark including comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO eliminates the need for human prompting and annotation in LLM fine-tuning while achieving the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor, with less than 10% of the computational resources. The training recipes and models will be released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15313v1,2024-08
Toward Large Language Models as a Therapeutic Tool: Comparing Prompting Techniques to Improve GPT-Delivered Problem-Solving Therapy,"Daniil Filienko, Yinzhou Wang, Caroline El Jazmi, Serena Xie, Trevor Cohen, Martine De Cock, Weichao Yuwen","While Large Language Models (LLMs) are being quickly adapted to many domains, including healthcare, their strengths and pitfalls remain under-explored.

We present evaluation results of the models' performances by automatic metrics and experienced medical professionals. We demonstrate that the models' capability to deliver protocolized therapy can be improved with the proper use of prompt engineering methods, albeit with limitations. To our knowledge, this study is among the first to assess the effects of various prompting techniques in enhancing a generalist model's ability to deliver psychotherapy, focusing on overall quality, consistency, and empathy.

Classifying populist language in American presidential and governor speeches using automatic text analysis,"Olaf van der Veen, Semir Dzebo, Levi Littvay, Kirk Hawkins, Oren Dar","Populism is a concept that is often used but notoriously difficult to measure. Common qualitative measurements like holistic grading or content analysis require great amounts of time and labour, making it difficult to quickly scope out which politicians should be classified as populist and which should not, while quantitative methods show mixed results when it comes to classifying populist rhetoric. In this paper, we develop a pipeline to train and validate an automated classification model to estimate the use of populist language. We train models based on sentences that were identified as populist and pluralist in 300 US governors' speeches from 2010 to 2018 and in 45 speeches of presidential candidates in 2016. We find that these models classify most speeches correctly, including 84% of governor speeches and 89% of presidential speeches. These results extend to different time periods (with 92% accuracy on more recent American governors), different amounts of data (with as few as 70 training sentences per category achieving similar results), and when classifying politicians instead of individual speeches. This pipeline is thus an effective tool that can optimise the systematic and swift classification of the use of populist language in politicians' speeches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15213v1,2024-08
Can Unconfident LLM Annotations Be Used for Confident Conclusions?,"Kristina Gligorić, Tijana Zrnic, Cinoo Lee, Emmanuel J. Candès, Dan Jurafsky","Large language models (LLMs) have shown high agreement with human raters across a variety of tasks, demonstrating potential to ease the challenges of human data collection. In computational social science (CSS), researchers are increasingly leveraging LLM annotations to complement slow and expensive human annotations. Still, guidelines for collecting and using LLM annotations, without compromising the validity of downstream conclusions, remain limited. We introduce Confidence-Driven Inference: a method that combines LLM annotations and LLM confidence indicators to strategically select which human annotations should be collected, with the goal of producing accurate statistical estimates and provably valid confidence intervals while reducing the number of human annotations needed. Our approach comes with safeguards against LLM annotations of poor quality, guaranteeing that the conclusions will be both valid and no less accurate than if we only relied on human annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Confidence-Driven Inference over baselines in statistical estimation tasks across three CSS settings--text politeness, stance, and bias--reducing the needed number of human annotations by over 25% in each. Although we use CSS settings for demonstration, Confidence-Driven Inference can be used to estimate most standard quantities across a broad range of NLP problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15204v1,2024-08
Infusing Acoustic Pause Context into Text-Based Dementia Assessment,"Franziska Braun, Sebastian P.

This work investigates the use of pause-enriched transcripts in transformer-based language models to differentiate the cognitive states of subjects with no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's dementia based on their speech from a clinical assessment. We address three binary classification tasks: Onset, monitoring, and dementia exclusion. The performance is evaluated through experiments on a German Verbal Fluency Test and a Picture Description Test, comparing the model's effectiveness across different speech production contexts. Starting from a textual baseline, we investigate the effect of incorporation of pause information and acoustic context. We show the test should be chosen depending on the task, and similarly, lexical pause information and acoustic cross-attention contribute differently.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15188v1,2024-08
Unlocking Potential in Pre-Trained Music Language Models for Versatile Multi-Track Music Arrangement,"Longshen Ou, Jingwei Zhao, Ziyu Wang, Gus Xia, Ye Wang","Large language models have shown significant capabilities across various domains, including symbolic music generation. However, leveraging these pre-trained models for controllable music arrangement tasks, each requiring different forms of musical information as control, remains a novel challenge. In this paper, we propose a unified sequence-to-sequence framework that enables the fine-tuning of a symbolic music language model for multiple multi-track arrangement tasks, including band arrangement, piano reduction, drum arrangement, and voice separation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves higher musical quality compared to task-specific baselines across all four tasks. Furthermore, through additional experiments on probing analysis, we show the pre-training phase equips the model with essential knowledge to understand musical conditions, which is hard to acquired solely through task-specific fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15176v1,2024-08
X-Reflect: Cross-Reflection Prompting for Multimodal Recommendation,"Hanjia Lyu, Ryan Rossi, Xiang Chen, Md Mehrab Tanjim, Stefano Petrangeli, Somdeb Sarkhel, Jiebo Luo","Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of enriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation systems. However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting LMMs to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images. By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually richer item representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the generalizability of our framework across different LMM backbones and the robustness of the prompting strategies, offering insights for optimization. This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents a novel solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15172v1,2024-08
Measuring text summarization factuality using atomic facts entailment metrics in the context of retrieval augmented generation,N. E. Kriman,"The use of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased since the introduction of ChatGPT in 2022, demonstrating their value across various applications. However, a major challenge for enterprise and commercial adoption of LLMs is their tendency to generate inaccurate information, a phenomenon known as ""hallucination."" This project proposes a method for estimating the factuality of a summary generated by LLMs when compared to a source text. Our approach utilizes Naive Bayes classification to assess the accuracy of the content produced.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15171v1,2024-08
How transformers learn structured data: insights from hierarchical filtering,"Jerome Garnier-Brun, Marc Mézard, Emanuele Moscato, Luca Saglietti","Understanding the learning process and the embedded computation in transformers is becoming a central goal for the development of interpretable AI. In the present study, we introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for generative models of sequences on trees, allowing us to hand-tune the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformers can approximate the exact inference algorithm when trained on root classification and masked language modeling tasks, and study how this computation is discovered and implemented. We find that correlations at larger distances, corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy, are sequentially included by the network during training. Moreover, by comparing attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering and by probing the different encoder levels, we find clear evidence of a reconstruction of correlations on successive length scales corresponding to the various levels of the hierarchy, which we relate to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm within the same architecture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15138v2,2024-08
Zero-Shot Visual Reasoning by Vision-Language Models: Benchmarking and Analysis,"Aishik Nagar, Shantanu Jaiswal, Cheston Tan","Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive zero- and few-shot performance on real-world visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, alluding to their capabilities as visual reasoning engines. However, the benchmarks being used conflate ""pure"" visual reasoning with world knowledge, and also have questions that involve a limited number of reasoning steps. Thus, it remains unclear whether a VLM's apparent visual reasoning performance is due to its world knowledge, or due to actual visual reasoning capabilities.   To clarify this ambiguity, we systematically benchmark and dissect the zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs through synthetic datasets that require minimal world knowledge, and allow for analysis over a broad range of reasoning steps. We focus on two novel aspects of zero-shot visual reasoning: i) evaluating the impact of conveying scene information as either visual embeddings or purely textual scene descriptions to the underlying large language model (LLM) of the VLM, and ii) comparing the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting to standard prompting for zero-shot visual reasoning.   We find that the underlying LLMs, when provided textual scene descriptions, consistently perform better compared to being provided visual embeddings. In particular, 18% higher accuracy is achieved on the PTR dataset. We also find that CoT prompting performs marginally better than standard prompting only for the comparatively large GPT-3.5-Turbo (175B) model, and does worse for smaller-scale models. This suggests the emergence of CoT abilities for visual reasoning in LLMs at larger scales even when world knowledge is limited. Overall, we find limitations in the abilities of VLMs and LLMs for more complex visual reasoning, and highlight the important role that LLMs can play in visual reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00106v1,2024-08
Negation Blindness in Large Language Models: Unveiling the NO Syndrome in Image Generation,"Mohammad Nadeem, Shahab Saquib Sohail, Erik Cambria, Björn W. Schuller, Amir Hussain","Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed the way we perceive technology. They have been shown to excel in tasks ranging from poem writing and coding to essay generation and puzzle solving. With the incorporation of image generation capability, they have become more comprehensive and versatile AI tools. At the same time, researchers are striving to identify the limitations of these tools to improve them further. Currently identified flaws include hallucination, biases, and bypassing restricted commands to generate harmful content. In the present work, we have identified a fundamental limitation related to the image generation ability of LLMs, and termed it The NO Syndrome. This negation blindness refers to LLMs inability to correctly comprehend NO related natural language prompts to generate the desired images. Interestingly, all tested LLMs including GPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot were found to be suffering from this syndrome. To demonstrate the generalization of this limitation, we carried out simulation experiments and conducted entropy-based and benchmark statistical analysis tests on various LLMs in multiple languages, including English, Hindi, and French. We conclude that the NO syndrome is a significant flaw in current LLMs that needs to be addressed. A related finding of this study showed a consistent discrepancy between image and textual responses as a result of this NO syndrome. We posit that the introduction of a negation context-aware reinforcement learning based feedback loop between the LLMs textual response and generated image could help ensure the generated text is based on both the LLMs correct contextual understanding of the negation query and the generated visual output.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00105v2,2024-08
Relation Also Knows: Rethinking the Recall and Editing of Factual Associations in Auto-Regressive Transformer Language Models,"Xiyu Liu, Zhengxiao Liu, Naibin Gu, Zheng Lin, Wanli Ma, Ji Xiang, Weiping Wang","The storage and recall of factual associations in auto-regressive transformer language models (LMs) have drawn a great deal of attention, inspiring knowledge editing by directly modifying the located model weights. Most editing works achieve knowledge editing under the guidance of existing interpretations of knowledge recall that mainly focus on subject knowledge. However, these interpretations are seriously flawed, neglecting relation information and leading to the over-generalizing problem for editing. In this work, we discover a novel relation-focused perspective to interpret the knowledge recall of transformer LMs during inference and apply it on knowledge editing to avoid over-generalizing. Experimental results on the dataset supplemented with a new R-Specificity criterion demonstrate that our editing approach significantly alleviates over-generalizing while remaining competitive on other criteria, breaking the domination of subject-focused editing for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15091v1,2024-08

Specifically, the data processing pipeline consists of broad collection to scale up and reweighting to improve quality. We then pretrain a 7B model BaichuanSEED with 3T tokens processed by our pipeline without any deliberate downstream task-related optimization, followed by an easy but effective supervised fine-tuning stage.

Nuance Matters: Probing Epistemic Consistency in Causal Reasoning,"Shaobo Cui, Junyou Li, Luca Mouchel, Yiyang Feng, Boi Faltings","To address this gap, our study introduces the concept of causal epistemic consistency, which focuses on the self-consistency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in differentiating intermediates with nuanced differences in causal reasoning. We propose a suite of novel metrics -- intensity ranking concordance, cross-group position agreement, and intra-group clustering -- to evaluate LLMs on this front. Through extensive empirical studies on 21 high-profile LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude3, and LLaMA3-70B, we have favoring evidence that current models struggle to maintain epistemic consistency in identifying the polarity and intensity of intermediates in causal reasoning. Additionally, we explore the potential of using internal token probabilities as an auxiliary tool to maintain causal epistemic consistency. In summary, our study bridges a critical gap in AI research by investigating the self-consistency over fine-grained intermediates involved in causal reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00103v1,2024-08
Self-supervised Topic Taxonomy Discovery in the Box Embedding Space,"Yuyin Lu, Hegang Chen, Pengbo Mao, Yanghui Rao, Haoran Xie, Fu Lee Wang, Qing Li","Topic taxonomy discovery aims at uncovering topics of different abstraction levels and constructing hierarchical relations between them. Unfortunately, most of prior work can hardly model semantic scopes of words and topics by holding the Euclidean embedding space assumption. What's worse, they infer asymmetric hierarchical relations by symmetric distances between topic embeddings. As a result, existing methods suffer from problems of low-quality topics at high abstraction levels and inaccurate hierarchical relations. To alleviate these problems, this paper develops a Box embedding-based Topic Model (BoxTM) that maps words and topics into the box embedding space, where the asymmetric metric is defined to properly infer hierarchical relations among topics. Additionally, our BoxTM explicitly infers upper-level topics based on correlation between specific topics through recursive clustering on topic boxes. Finally, extensive experiments validate high-quality of the topic taxonomy learned by BoxTM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15050v1,2024-08

Evidence-Enhanced Triplet Generation Framework for Hallucination Alleviation in Generative Question Answering,"Haowei Du, Huishuai Zhang, Dongyan Zhao","To address the hallucination in generative question answering (GQA) where the answer can not be derived from the document, we propose a novel evidence-enhanced triplet generation framework, EATQA, encouraging the model to predict all the combinations of (Question, Evidence, Answer) triplet by flipping the source pair and the target label to understand their logical relationships, i.e., predict Answer(A), Question(Q), and Evidence(E) given a QE, EA, and QA pairs, respectively. Furthermore, we bridge the distribution gap to distill the knowledge from evidence in inference stage. Our framework ensures the model to learn the logical relation between query, evidence and answer, which simultaneously improves the evidence generation and query answering. In this paper, we apply EATQA to LLama and it outperforms other LLMs-based methods and hallucination mitigation approaches on two challenging GQA benchmarks. Further analysis shows that our method not only keeps prior knowledge within LLM, but also mitigates hallucination and generates faithful answers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15037v1,2024-08

In this paper, we propose YOLO-Stutter: a first end-to-end method that detects dysfluencies in a time-accurate manner. YOLO-Stutter takes imperfect speech-text alignment as input, followed by a spatial feature aggregator, and a temporal dependency extractor to perform region-wise boundary and class predictions.

AgentMonitor: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Predictive and Secure Multi-Agent Systems,"Chi-Min Chan, Jianxuan Yu, Weize Chen, Chunyang Jiang, Xinyu Liu, Weijie Shi, Zhiyuan Liu, Wei Xue, Yike Guo","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the rise of LLM-based agents. Recent research shows that multi-agent systems (MAS), where each agent plays a specific role, can outperform individual LLMs. However, configuring an MAS for a task remains challenging, with performance only observable post-execution. Inspired by scaling laws in LLM development, we investigate whether MAS performance can be predicted beforehand. We introduce AgentMonitor, a framework that integrates at the agent level to capture inputs and outputs, transforming them into statistics for training a regression model to predict task performance. Additionally, it can further apply real-time corrections to address security risks posed by malicious agents, mitigating negative impacts and enhancing MAS security. Experiments demonstrate that an XGBoost model achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.89 in-domain and 0.58 in more challenging scenarios. Furthermore, using AgentMonitor reduces harmful content by 6.2% and increases helpful content by 1.8% on average, enhancing safety and reliability.

MRSE: An Efficient Multi-modality Retrieval System for Large Scale E-commerce,"Hao Jiang, Haoxiang Zhang, Qingshan Hou, Chaofeng Chen, Weisi Lin, Jingchang Zhang, Annan Wang","Providing high-quality item recall for text queries is crucial in large-scale e-commerce search systems. Current Embedding-based Retrieval Systems (ERS) embed queries and items into a shared low-dimensional space, but uni-modality ERS rely too heavily on textual features, making them unreliable in complex contexts. While multi-modality ERS incorporate various data sources, they often overlook individual preferences for different modalities, leading to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we propose MRSE, a Multi-modality Retrieval System that integrates text, item images, and user preferences through lightweight mixture-of-expert (LMoE) modules to better align features across and within modalities. MRSE also builds user profiles at a multi-modality level and introduces a novel hybrid loss function that enhances consistency and robustness using hard negative sampling. Experiments on a large-scale dataset from Shopee and online A/B testing show that MRSE achieves an 18.9% improvement in offline relevance and a 3.7% gain in online core metrics compared to Shopee's state-of-the-art uni-modality system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14968v1,2024-08
Multilingual Arbitrage: Optimizing Data Pools to Accelerate Multilingual Progress,"Ayomide Odumakinde, Daniel D'souza, Pat Verga, Beyza Ermis, Sara Hooker","The use of synthetic data has played a critical role in recent state-of-art breakthroughs. However, overly relying on a single oracle teacher model to generate data has been shown to lead to model collapse and invite propagation of biases. These limitations are particularly evident in multilingual settings, where the absence of a universally effective teacher model that excels across all languages presents significant challenges. In this work, we address these extreme difference by introducing ""multilingual arbitrage"", which capitalizes on performance variations between multiple models for a given language. To do so, we strategically route samples through a diverse pool of models, each with unique strengths in different languages. Across exhaustive experiments on state-of-art models, our work suggests that arbitrage techniques allow for spectacular gains in performance that far outperform relying on a single teacher. In particular, compared to the best single teacher, we observe gains of up to 56.5% improvement in win rates averaged across all languages when switching to multilingual arbitrage. We observe the most significant gains for the least resourced languages in our pool.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14960v1,2024-08
SpikingSSMs: Learning Long Sequences with Sparse and Parallel Spiking State Space Models,"Shuaijie Shen, Chao Wang, Renzhuo Huang, Yan Zhong, Qinghai Guo, Zhichao Lu, Jianguo Zhang, Luziwei Leng","Known as low energy consumption networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained a lot of attention within the past decades. While SNNs are increasing competitive with artificial neural networks (ANNs) for vision tasks, they are rarely used for long sequence tasks, despite their intrinsic temporal dynamics. In this work, we develop spiking state space models (SpikingSSMs) for long sequence learning by leveraging on the sequence learning abilities of state space models (SSMs). Inspired by dendritic neuron structure, we hierarchically integrate neuronal dynamics with the original SSM block, meanwhile realizing sparse synaptic computation. Furthermore, to solve the conflict of event-driven neuronal dynamics with parallel computing, we propose a light-weight surrogate dynamic network which accurately predicts the after-reset membrane potential and compatible to learnable thresholds, enabling orders of acceleration in training speed compared with conventional iterative methods. On the long range arena benchmark task, SpikingSSM achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art SSMs meanwhile realizing on average 90\% of network sparsity. On language modeling, our network significantly surpasses existing spiking large language models (spikingLLMs) on the WikiText-103 dataset with only a third of the model size, demonstrating its potential as backbone architecture for low computation cost LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14909v2,2024-08
Triplètoile: Extraction of Knowledge from Microblogging Text,"Vanni Zavarella, Sergio Consoli, Diego Reforgiato Recupero, Gianni Fenu, Simone Angioni, Davide Buscaldi, Danilo Dessì, Francesco Osborne","Numerous methods and pipelines have recently emerged for the automatic extraction of knowledge graphs from documents such as scientific publications and patents. However, adapting these methods to incorporate alternative text sources like micro-blogging posts and news has proven challenging as they struggle to model open-domain entities and relations, typically found in these sources. In this paper, we propose an enhanced information extraction pipeline tailored to the extraction of a knowledge graph comprising open-domain entities from micro-blogging posts on social media platforms. Our pipeline leverages dependency parsing and classifies entity relations in an unsupervised manner through hierarchical clustering over word embeddings. We provide a use case on extracting semantic triples from a corpus of 100 thousand tweets about digital transformation and publicly release the generated knowledge graph.

Writing in the Margins: Better Inference Pattern for Long Context Retrieval,"Melisa Russak, Umar Jamil, Christopher Bryant, Kiran Kamble, Axel Magnuson, Mateusz Russak, Waseem AlShikh","In this paper, we introduce Writing in the Margins (WiM), a new inference pattern for Large Language Models designed to optimize the handling of long input sequences in retrieval-oriented tasks. This approach leverages the chunked prefill of the key-value cache to perform segment-wise inference, which enables efficient processing of extensive contexts along with the generation and classification of intermediate information (""margins"") that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computational overhead marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe that WiM provides an average enhancement of 7.5% in accuracy for reasoning skills (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG) and more than a 30.0% increase in the F1-score for aggregation tasks (CWE). Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into an interactive retrieval design that provides end-users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing, and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response.

In this paper, we construct an MMKG based on synchronized multi-view simulated videos of daily activities. Besides representing the content of daily life videos as event-centric knowledge, our MMKG also includes frame-by-frame fine-grained changes, such as bounding boxes within video frames.

A Functional Trade-off between Prosodic and Semantic Cues in Conveying Sarcasm,"Zhu Li, Xiyuan Gao, Yuqing Zhang, Shekhar Nayak, Matt Coler","This study investigates the acoustic features of sarcasm and disentangles the interplay between the propensity of an utterance being used sarcastically and the presence of prosodic cues signaling sarcasm. Using a dataset of sarcastic utterances compiled from television shows, we analyze the prosodic features within utterances and key phrases belonging to three distinct sarcasm categories (embedded, propositional, and illocutionary), which vary in the degree of semantic cues present, and compare them to neutral expressions. Results show that in phrases where the sarcastic meaning is salient from the semantics, the prosodic cues are less relevant than when the sarcastic meaning is not evident from the semantics, suggesting a trade-off between prosodic and semantic cues of sarcasm at the phrase level. These findings highlight a lessened reliance on prosodic modulation in semantically dense sarcastic expressions and a nuanced interaction that shapes the communication of sarcastic intent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14892v1,2024-08
Inverse-Q*: Token Level Reinforcement Learning for Aligning Large Language Models Without Preference Data,"Han Xia, Songyang Gao, Qiming Ge, Zhiheng Xi, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models with human intentions, yet it often relies on complex methodologies like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and present challenges in sample efficiency and stability. In this paper, we introduce Inverse-Q*, an innovative framework that transcends traditional RL methods by optimizing token-level reinforcement learning without the need for additional reward or value models. Inverse-Q* leverages direct preference optimization techniques but extends them by estimating the conditionally optimal policy directly from the model's responses, facilitating more granular and flexible policy shaping. Our approach reduces reliance on human annotation and external supervision, making it especially suitable for low-resource settings. We present extensive experimental results demonstrating that Inverse-Q* not only matches but potentially exceeds the effectiveness of PPO in terms of convergence speed and the alignment of model responses with human preferences. Our findings suggest that Inverse-Q* offers a practical and robust alternative to conventional RLHF approaches, paving the way for more efficient and adaptable model training approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14874v2,2024-08
Advancing Adversarial Suffix Transfer Learning on Aligned Large Language Models,"Hongfu Liu, Yuxi Xie, Ye Wang, Michael Shieh","Language Language Models (LLMs) face safety concerns due to potential misuse by malicious users. Recent red-teaming efforts have identified adversarial suffixes capable of jailbreaking LLMs using the gradient-based search algorithm Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG). However, GCG struggles with computational inefficiency, limiting further investigations regarding suffix transferability and scalability across models and data. In this work, we bridge the connection between search efficiency and suffix transferability. We propose a two-stage transfer learning framework, DeGCG, which decouples the search process into behavior-agnostic pre-searching and behavior-relevant post-searching. Specifically, we employ direct first target token optimization in pre-searching to facilitate the search process. We apply our approach to cross-model, cross-data, and self-transfer scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce an interleaved variant of our approach, i-DeGCG, which iteratively leverages self-transferability to accelerate the search process. Experiments on HarmBench demonstrate the efficiency of our approach across various models and domains. Notably, our i-DeGCG outperforms the baseline on Llama2-chat-7b with ASRs of $43.9$ ($+22.2$) and $39.0$ ($+19.5$) on valid and test sets, respectively. Further analysis on cross-model transfer indicates the pivotal role of first target token optimization in leveraging suffix transferability for efficient searching.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14866v2,2024-08
Learning Granularity Representation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion,"Jinchuan Zhang, Tianqi Wan, Chong Mu, Guangxi Lu, Ling Tian","Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) incorporate temporal information to reflect the dynamic structural knowledge and evolutionary patterns of real-world facts. Nevertheless, TKGs are still limited in downstream applications due to the problem of incompleteness. Consequently, TKG completion (also known as link prediction) has been widely studied, with recent research focusing on incorporating independent embeddings of time or combining them with entities and relations to form temporal representations. However, most existing methods overlook the impact of history from a multi-granularity aspect. The inherent semantics of human-defined temporal granularities, such as ordinal dates, reveal general patterns to which facts typically adhere. To counter this limitation, this paper proposes \textbf{L}earning \textbf{G}ranularity \textbf{Re}presentation (termed $\mathsf{LGRe}$) for TKG completion. It comprises two main components: Granularity Representation Learning (GRL) and Adaptive Granularity Balancing (AGB). Specifically, GRL employs time-specific multi-layer convolutional neural networks to capture interactions between entities and relations at different granularities. After that, AGB generates adaptive weights for these embeddings according to temporal semantics, resulting in expressive representations of predictions. Moreover, to reflect similar semantics of adjacent timestamps, a temporal loss function is introduced. Extensive experimental results on four event benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of $\mathsf{LGRe}$ in learning time-related representations.

Detecting AI Flaws: Target-Driven Attacks on Internal Faults in Language Models,"Yuhao Du, Zhuo Li, Pengyu Cheng, Xiang Wan, Anningzhe Gao","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a focal point in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. However, a critical concern is the presence of toxic content within the pre-training corpus of these models, which can lead to the generation of inappropriate outputs. Investigating methods for detecting internal faults in LLMs can help us understand their limitations and improve their security. Existing methods primarily focus on jailbreaking attacks, which involve manually or automatically constructing adversarial content to prompt the target LLM to generate unexpected responses. These methods rely heavily on prompt engineering, which is time-consuming and usually requires specially designed questions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a target-driven attack paradigm that focuses on directly eliciting the target response instead of optimizing the prompts. We introduce the use of another LLM as the detector for toxic content, referred to as ToxDet. Given a target toxic response, ToxDet can generate a possible question and a preliminary answer to provoke the target model into producing desired toxic responses with meanings equivalent to the provided one. ToxDet is trained by interacting with the target LLM and receiving reward signals from it, utilizing reinforcement learning for the optimization process. While the primary focus of the target models is on open-source LLMs, the fine-tuned ToxDet can also be transferred to attack black-box models such as GPT-4o, achieving notable results. Experimental results on AdvBench and HH-Harmless datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in detecting the tendencies of target LLMs to generate harmful responses. This algorithm not only exposes vulnerabilities but also provides a valuable resource for researchers to strengthen their models against such attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14853v1,2024-08

AAVENUE builds upon and extends existing benchmarks like VALUE, replacing deterministic syntactic and morphological transformations with a more flexible methodology leveraging LLM-based translation with few-shot prompting, improving performance across our evaluation metrics when translating key tasks from the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. We compare AAVENUE and VALUE translations using five popular LLMs and a comprehensive set of metrics including fluency, BARTScore, quality, coherence, and understandability. Additionally, we recruit fluent AAVE speakers to validate our translations for authenticity.

CL4KGE: A Curriculum Learning Method for Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Yang Liu, Chuan Zhou, Peng Zhang, Yanan Cao, Yongchao Liu, Zhao Li, Hongyang Chen","Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) constitutes a foundational task, directed towards learning representations for entities and relations within knowledge graphs (KGs), with the objective of crafting representations comprehensive enough to approximate the logical and symbolic interconnections among entities. In this paper, we define a metric Z-counts to measure the difficulty of training each triple ($<$head entity, relation, tail entity$>$) in KGs with theoretical analysis. Based on this metric, we propose \textbf{CL4KGE}, an efficient \textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{L}earning based training strategy for \textbf{KGE}. This method includes a difficulty measurer and a training scheduler that aids in the training of KGE models. Our approach possesses the flexibility to act as a plugin within a wide range of KGE models, with the added advantage of adaptability to the majority of KGs in existence. The proposed method has been evaluated on popular KGE models, and the results demonstrate that it enhances the state-of-the-art methods. The use of Z-counts as a metric has enabled the identification of challenging triples in KGs, which helps in devising effective training strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14840v2,2024-08
PolicyLR: A Logic Representation For Privacy Policies,"Ashish Hooda, Rishabh Khandelwal, Prasad Chalasani, Kassem Fawaz, Somesh Jha","Privacy policies are crucial in the online ecosystem, defining how services handle user data and adhere to regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. However, their complexity and frequent updates often make them difficult for stakeholders to understand and analyze. Current automated analysis methods, which utilize natural language processing, have limitations. They typically focus on individual tasks and fail to capture the full context of the policies. We propose PolicyLR, a new paradigm that offers a comprehensive machine-readable representation of privacy policies, serving as an all-in-one solution for multiple downstream tasks. PolicyLR converts privacy policies into a machine-readable format using valuations of atomic formulae, allowing for formal definitions of tasks like compliance and consistency. We have developed a compiler that transforms unstructured policy text into this format using off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs). This compiler breaks down the transformation task into a two-stage translation and entailment procedure. This procedure considers the full context of the privacy policy to infer a complex formula, where each formula consists of simpler atomic formulae. The advantage of this model is that PolicyLR is interpretable by design and grounded in segments of the privacy policy. We evaluated the compiler using ToS;DR, a community-annotated privacy policy entailment dataset. Utilizing open-source LLMs, our compiler achieves precision and recall values of 0.91 and 0.88, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of PolicyLR in three privacy tasks: Policy Compliance, Inconsistency Detection, and Privacy Comparison Shopping.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14830v1,2024-08
"From Rule-Based Models to Deep Learning Transformers Architectures for Natural Language Processing and Sign Language Translation Systems: Survey, Taxonomy and Performance Evaluation","Nada Shahin, Leila Ismail","With the growing Deaf and Hard of Hearing population worldwide and the persistent shortage of certified sign language interpreters, there is a pressing need for an efficient, signs-driven, integrated end-to-end translation system, from sign to gloss to text and vice-versa. There has been a wealth of research on machine translations and related reviews. However, there are few works on sign language machine translation considering the particularity of the language being continuous and dynamic. This paper aims to address this void, providing a retrospective analysis of the temporal evolution of sign language machine translation algorithms and a taxonomy of the Transformers architectures, the most used approach in language translation. We also present the requirements of a real-time Quality-of-Service sign language ma-chine translation system underpinned by accurate deep learning algorithms. We propose future research directions for sign language translation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14825v1,2024-08
GSIFN: A Graph-Structured and Interlaced-Masked Multimodal Transformer-based Fusion Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,Yijie Jin,"Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) leverages multiple data modals to analyze human sentiment. Existing MSA models generally employ cutting-edge multimodal fusion and representation learning-based methods to promote MSA capability. However, there are two key challenges: (i) in existing multimodal fusion methods, the decoupling of modal combinations and tremendous parameter redundancy, lead to insufficient fusion performance and efficiency; (ii) a challenging trade-off exists between representation capability and computational overhead in unimodal feature extractors and encoders. Our proposed GSIFN incorporates two main components to solve these problems: (i) a graph-structured and interlaced-masked multimodal Transformer. It adopts the Interlaced Mask mechanism to construct robust multimodal graph embedding, achieve all-modal-in-one Transformer-based fusion, and greatly reduce the computational overhead; (ii) a self-supervised learning framework with low computational overhead and high performance, which utilizes a parallelized LSTM with matrix memory to enhance non-verbal modal features for unimodal label generation. Evaluated on the MSA datasets CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS, GSIFN demonstrates superior performance with significantly lower computational overhead compared with previous state-of-the-art models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14809v4,2024-08
Measuring Human Contribution in AI-Assisted Content Generation,"Yueqi Xie, Tao Qi, Jingwei Yi, Ryan Whalen, Junming Huang, Qian Ding, Yu Xie, Xing Xie, Fangzhao Wu","With the growing prevalence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), an increasing amount of content is no longer exclusively generated by humans but by generative AI models with human guidance. This shift presents notable challenges for the delineation of originality due to the varying degrees of human contribution in AI-assisted works. This study raises the research question of measuring human contribution in AI-assisted content generation and introduces a framework to address this question that is grounded in information theory. By calculating mutual information between human input and AI-assisted output relative to self-information of AI-assisted output, we quantify the proportional information contribution of humans in content generation. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed measure effectively discriminates between varying degrees of human contribution across multiple creative domains. We hope that this work lays a foundation for measuring human contributions in AI-assisted content generation in the era of generative AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14792v1,2024-08
Instruct-SkillMix: A Powerful Pipeline for LLM Instruction Tuning,"Simran Kaur, Simon Park, Anirudh Goyal, Sanjeev Arora","We introduce Instruct-SkillMix, an automated approach for creating diverse, high quality SFT data. The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline involves two stages, each leveraging an existing powerful LLM: (1) Skill extraction: uses the LLM to extract core ""skills"" for instruction-following, either from existing datasets, or by directly prompting the model; (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills. Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty.   Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench. With just $4$K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. To our knowledge, this achieves state-of-the-art performance among all models that have only undergone SFT (no RL methods) and competes with proprietary models such as Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct.   Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult. Introducing low quality answers (""shirkers"") in $20\%$ of Instruct-SkillMix examples causes performance to plummet, sometimes catastrophically.   The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline is flexible and is adaptable to other settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14774v3,2024-08
A global AI community requires language-diverse publishing,"Haley Lepp, Parth Sarin","In this provocation, we discuss the English dominance of the AI research community, arguing that the requirement for English language publishing upholds and reinforces broader regimes of extraction in AI. While large language models and machine translation have been celebrated as a way to break down barriers, we regard their use as a symptom of linguistic exclusion of scientists and potential readers. We propose alternative futures for a healthier publishing culture, organized around three themes: administering conferences in the languages of the country in which they are held, instructing peer reviewers not to adjudicate the language appropriateness of papers, and offering opportunities to publish and present in multiple languages.

Query-by-Example Keyword Spotting Using Spectral-Temporal Graph Attentive Pooling and Multi-Task Learning,"Zhenyu Wang, Shuyu Kong, Li Wan, Biqiao Zhang, Yiteng Huang, Mumin Jin, Ming Sun, Xin Lei, Zhaojun Yang","Existing keyword spotting (KWS) systems primarily rely on predefined keyword phrases. However, the ability to recognize customized keywords is crucial for tailoring interactions with intelligent devices. In this paper, we present a novel Query-by-Example (QbyE) KWS system that employs spectral-temporal graph attentive pooling and multi-task learning. This framework aims to effectively learn speaker-invariant and linguistic-informative embeddings for QbyE KWS tasks. Within this framework, we investigate three distinct network architectures for encoder modeling: LiCoNet, Conformer and ECAPA_TDNN. The experimental results on a substantial internal dataset of $629$ speakers have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed QbyE framework in maximizing the potential of simpler models such as LiCoNet. Particularly, LiCoNet, which is 13x more efficient, achieves comparable performance to the computationally intensive Conformer model (1.98% vs. 1.63\% FRR at 0.3 FAs/Hr).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00099v2,2024-08
LyCon: Lyrics Reconstruction from the Bag-of-Words Using Large Language Models,"Haven Kim, Kahyun Choi","This paper addresses the unique challenge of conducting research in lyric studies, where direct use of lyrics is often restricted due to copyright concerns. Unlike typical data, internet-sourced lyrics are frequently protected under copyright law, necessitating alternative approaches. Our study introduces a novel method for generating copyright-free lyrics from publicly available Bag-of-Words (BoW) datasets, which contain the vocabulary of lyrics but not the lyrics themselves. Utilizing metadata associated with BoW datasets and large language models, we successfully reconstructed lyrics. We have compiled and made available a dataset of reconstructed lyrics, LyCon, aligned with metadata from renowned sources including the Million Song Dataset, Deezer Mood Detection Dataset, and AllMusic Genre Dataset, available for public access. We believe that the integration of metadata such as mood annotations or genres enables a variety of academic experiments on lyrics, such as conditional lyric generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14750v1,2024-08
How to Train Text Summarization Model with Weak Supervisions,"Yanbo Wang, Wenyu Chen, Shimin Shan","Currently, machine learning techniques have seen significant success across various applications. Most of these techniques rely on supervision from human-generated labels or a mixture of noisy and imprecise labels from multiple sources. However, for certain complex tasks, even noisy or inexact labels are unavailable due to the intricacy of the objectives. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that breaks down the complex objective into simpler tasks and generates supervision signals for each one. We then integrate these supervision signals into a manageable form, resulting in a straightforward learning procedure. As a case study, we demonstrate a system used for topic-based summarization. This system leverages rich supervision signals to promote both summarization and topic relevance. Remarkably, we can train the model end-to-end without any labels. Experimental results indicate that our approach performs exceptionally well on the CNN and DailyMail datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00098v1,2024-08

Melton, Mingquan Lin, Rui Zhang","Automatic disease diagnosis has become increasingly valuable in clinical practice. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, with growing evidence supporting the efficacy of LLMs in diagnostic tasks. Despite the increasing attention in this field, a holistic view is still lacking. Many critical aspects remain unclear, such as the diseases and clinical data to which LLMs have been applied, the LLM techniques employed, and the evaluation methods used. In this article, we perform a comprehensive review of LLM-based methods for disease diagnosis. Our review examines the existing literature across various dimensions, including disease types and associated clinical specialties, clinical data, LLM techniques, and evaluation methods.

Non-instructional Fine-tuning: Enabling Instruction-Following Capabilities in Pre-trained Language Models without Instruction-Following Data,"Juncheng Xie, Shensian Syu, Hung-yi Lee","Instruction fine-tuning is crucial for today's large language models (LLMs) to learn to follow instructions and align with human preferences. Conventionally, supervised data, including the instruction and the correct response, is required for instruction fine-tuning. To obtain such data, some researchers prompted well-trained models like GPT-4 to generate instructions and correct responses. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses the first half of a random text from OpenWebText as the instruction and GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4-turbo to complete the text as the response. Despite the data being ""non-instructional"", we found that pre-trained LLMs fine-tuned on this data can gain instruction-following capabilities. This observation is verified by fine-tuning several well-known pre-trained LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mistral-7B-v0.1). The ""non-instructional data"" also improved some models that underwent supervised fine-tuning and human preference alignment. Our LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct fine-tuned through ""non-instructional data"" is comparable with LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct on the Arena Hard leaderboard. We analyzed the ""non-instructional data"" and ensured it is devoid of content related to instruction fine-tuning. Our findings will inspire further investigation into how to develop instruction-following capabilities without explicit instruction-related data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00096v1,2024-08
PAT: Pruning-Aware Tuning for Large Language Models,"Yijiang Liu, Huanrui Yang, Youxin Chen, Rongyu Zhang, Miao Wang, Yuan Du, Li Du","Large language models (LLMs) excel in language tasks, especially with supervised fine-tuning after pre-training. However, their substantial memory and computational requirements hinder practical applications. Structural pruning, which reduces less significant weight dimensions, is one solution. Yet, traditional post-hoc pruning often leads to significant performance loss, with limited recovery from further fine-tuning due to reduced capacity. Since the model fine-tuning refines the general and chaotic knowledge in pre-trained models, we aim to incorporate structural pruning with the fine-tuning, and propose the Pruning-Aware Tuning (PAT) paradigm to eliminate model redundancy while preserving the model performance to the maximum extend. Specifically, we insert the innovative Hybrid Sparsification Modules (HSMs) between the Attention and FFN components to accordingly sparsify the upstream and downstream linear modules. The HSM comprises a lightweight operator and a globally shared trainable mask. The lightweight operator maintains a training overhead comparable to that of LoRA, while the trainable mask unifies the channels to be sparsified, ensuring structural pruning. Additionally, we propose the Identity Loss which decouples the transformation and scaling properties of the HSMs to enhance training robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAT excels in both performance and efficiency. For example, our Llama2-7b model with a 25\% pruning ratio achieves 1.33$\times$ speedup while outperforming the LoRA-finetuned model by up to 1.26\% in accuracy with a similar training cost.

Smart Multi-Modal Search: Contextual Sparse and Dense Embedding Integration in Adobe Express,"Cherag Aroraa, Tracy Holloway King, Jayant Kumar, Yi Lu, Sanat Sharma, Arvind Srikantan, David Uvalle, Josep Valls-Vargas, Harsha Vardhan","As user content and queries become increasingly multi-modal, the need for effective multi-modal search systems has grown. Traditional search systems often rely on textual and metadata annotations for indexed images, while multi-modal embeddings like CLIP enable direct search using text and image embeddings. However, embedding-based approaches face challenges in integrating contextual features such as user locale and recency. Building a scalable multi-modal search system requires fine-tuning several components. This paper presents a multi-modal search architecture and a series of AB tests that optimize embeddings and multi-modal technologies in Adobe Express template search. We address considerations such as embedding model selection, the roles of embeddings in matching and ranking, and the balance between dense and sparse embeddings. Our iterative approach demonstrates how utilizing sparse, dense, and contextual features enhances short and long query search, significantly reduces null rates (over 70\%), and increases click-through rates (CTR). Our findings provide insights into developing robust multi-modal search systems, thereby enhancing relevance for complex queries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14698v2,2024-08
Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Models,"James Liu, Pragaash Ponnusamy, Tianle Cai, Han Guo, Yoon Kim, Ben Athiwaratkun","Activation sparsity can enable practical inference speedups in large language models (LLMs) by reducing the compute and memory-movement required for matrix multiplications during the forward pass. However, existing methods face limitations that inhibit widespread adoption. Some approaches are tailored towards older models with ReLU-based sparsity, while others require extensive continued pre-training on up to hundreds of billions of tokens. This paper describes TEAL, a simple training-free method that applies magnitude-based activation sparsity to hidden states throughout the entire model. TEAL achieves 40-50% model-wide sparsity with minimal performance degradation across Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, with sizes varying from 7B to 70B. We improve existing sparse kernels and demonstrate wall-clock decoding speed-ups of up to 1.53$\times$ and 1.8$\times$ at 40% and 50% model-wide sparsity. TEAL is compatible with weight quantization, enabling further efficiency gains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14690v2,2024-08
Relationships are Complicated! An Analysis of Relationships Between Datasets on the Web,"Kate Lin, Tarfah Alrashed, Natasha Noy","The Web today has millions of datasets, and the number of datasets continues to grow at a rapid pace. These datasets are not standalone entities; rather, they are intricately connected through complex relationships. Semantic relationships between datasets provide critical insights for research and decision-making processes. In this paper, we study dataset relationships from the perspective of users who discover, use, and share datasets on the Web: what relationships are important for different tasks? What contextual information might users want to know? We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of relationships between datasets on the Web and map these relationships to user tasks performed during dataset discovery. We develop a series of methods to identify these relationships and compare their performance on a large corpus of datasets generated from Web pages with schema.org markup. We demonstrate that machine-learning based methods that use dataset metadata achieve multi-class classification accuracy of 90%. Finally, we highlight gaps in available semantic markup for datasets and discuss how incorporating comprehensive semantics can facilitate the identification of dataset relationships.

Traditional information retrieval systems can assist with this task, but most systems have not been designed with LLM-generated queries in mind. As such, there is a compelling need for integrated systems that provide both retrieval and generation functionality within a single user interface.   We present MODOC, a modular user interface that leverages the capabilities of LLMs and provides assistance with detecting their confabulations, promoting integrity in scientific writing. MODOC represents a significant step forward in scientific writing assistance. Its modular architecture supports flexible functions for retrieving information and for writing and generating text in a single, user-friendly interface.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14623v1,2024-08
What Makes a Good Story and How Can We Measure It? A Comprehensive Survey of Story Evaluation,"Dingyi Yang, Qin Jin","With the development of artificial intelligence, particularly the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), the quantity and quality of automatically generated stories have significantly increased. This has led to the need for automatic story evaluation to assess the generative capabilities of computing systems and analyze the quality of both automatic-generated and human-written stories. Evaluating a story can be more challenging than other generation evaluation tasks. While tasks like machine translation primarily focus on assessing the aspects of fluency and accuracy, story evaluation demands complex additional measures such as overall coherence, character development, interestingness, etc. This requires a thorough review of relevant research. In this survey, we first summarize existing storytelling tasks, including text-to-text, visual-to-text, and text-to-visual. We highlight their evaluation challenges, identify various human criteria to measure stories, and present existing benchmark datasets. Then, we propose a taxonomy to organize evaluation metrics that have been developed or can be adopted for story evaluation. We also provide descriptions of these metrics, along with the discussion of their merits and limitations. Later, we discuss the human-AI collaboration for story evaluation and generation. Finally, we suggest potential future research directions, extending from story evaluation to general evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14622v1,2024-08
Surprisingly Fragile: Assessing and Addressing Prompt Instability in Multimodal Foundation Models,"Ian Stewart, Sameera Horawalavithana, Brendan Kennedy, Sai Munikoti, Karl Pazdernik","Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) such as OFASys show the potential to unlock analysis of complex data such as images, videos, and audio data via text prompts alone. However, their performance may suffer in the face of text input that differs even slightly from their training distribution, which is surprising considering the use of modality-specific data to ""ground"" the text input. This study demonstrates that prompt instability is a major concern for MFMs, leading to a consistent drop in performance across all modalities, but that instability can be mitigated with additional training with augmented data. We evaluate several methods for grounded prompt perturbation, where we generate perturbations and filter based on similarity to text and/or modality data. After re-training the models on the augmented data, we find improved accuracy and more stable performance on the perturbed test data regardless of perturbation condition, suggesting that the data augmentation strategy helps the models handle domain shifts more effectively. In error analysis, we find consistent patterns of performance improvement across domains, suggesting that retraining on prompt perturbations tends to help general reasoning capabilities in MFMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14595v1,2024-08
CURLoRA: Stable LLM Continual Fine-Tuning and Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation,Muhammad Fawi,"This paper introduces CURLoRA, a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) that leverages CUR matrix decomposition in the context of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our method addresses two critical challenges in LLM fine-tuning: mitigating catastrophic forgetting during continual learning and reducing the number of trainable parameters. We propose a unique modification to the CUR decomposition process, utilizing inverted probabilities for column and row selection which acts as an implicit regularization, and initializing the $U$ matrix as a zero matrix, and only fine-tuning it. We demonstrate through experiments on multiple datasets that CURLoRA outperforms standard LoRA in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. It maintains model stability and performance across tasks while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Our results show that CURLoRA achieves very good and stable task accuracy while maintaining base model's perplexity scores fixed compared to LoRA upon continual fine-tuning, particularly in scenarios with limited data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14572v1,2024-08
Improving Clinical Note Generation from Complex Doctor-Patient Conversation,"Yizhan Li, Sifan Wu, Christopher Smith, Thomas Lo, Bang Liu","Writing clinical notes and documenting medical exams is a critical task for healthcare professionals, serving as a vital component of patient care documentation. However, manually writing these notes is time-consuming and can impact the amount of time clinicians can spend on direct patient interaction and other tasks. Consequently, the development of automated clinical note generation systems has emerged as a clinically meaningful area of research within AI for health. In this paper, we present three key contributions to the field of clinical note generation using large language models (LLMs). First, we introduce CliniKnote, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 1,200 complex doctor-patient conversations paired with their full clinical notes. This dataset, created and curated by medical experts with the help of modern neural networks, provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating models in clinical note generation tasks. Second, we propose the K-SOAP (Keyword, Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) note format, which enhances traditional SOAP~\cite{podder2023soap} (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes by adding a keyword section at the top, allowing for quick identification of essential information. Third, we develop an automatic pipeline to generate K-SOAP notes from doctor-patient conversations and benchmark various modern LLMs using various metrics. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and performance compared to standard LLM finetuning methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14568v1,2024-08
Revisiting Image Captioning Training Paradigm via Direct CLIP-based Optimization,"Nicholas Moratelli, Davide Caffagni, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara","The conventional training approach for image captioning involves pre-training a network using teacher forcing and subsequent fine-tuning with Self-Critical Sequence Training to maximize hand-crafted captioning metrics. However, when attempting to optimize modern and higher-quality metrics like CLIP-Score and PAC-Score, this training method often encounters instability and fails to acquire the genuine descriptive capabilities needed to produce fluent and informative captions. In this paper, we propose a new training paradigm termed Direct CLIP-Based Optimization (DiCO). Our approach jointly learns and optimizes a reward model that is distilled from a learnable captioning evaluator with high human correlation. This is done by solving a weighted classification problem directly inside the captioner. At the same time, DiCO prevents divergence from the original model, ensuring that fluency is maintained. DiCO not only exhibits improved stability and enhanced quality in the generated captions but also aligns more closely with human preferences compared to existing methods, especially in modern metrics. Additionally, it maintains competitive performance in traditional metrics.

A Practitioner's Guide to Continual Multimodal Pretraining,"Karsten Roth, Vishaal Udandarao, Sebastian Dziadzio, Ameya Prabhu, Mehdi Cherti, Oriol Vinyals, Olivier Hénaff, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge, Zeynep Akata","Multimodal foundation models serve numerous applications at the intersection of vision and language. Still, despite being pretrained on extensive data, they become outdated over time. To keep models updated, research into continual pretraining mainly explores scenarios with either (1) infrequent, indiscriminate updates on large-scale new data, or (2) frequent, sample-level updates. However, practical model deployment often operates in the gap between these two limit cases, as real-world applications often demand adaptation to specific subdomains, tasks or concepts -- spread over the entire, varying life cycle of a model. In this work, we complement current perspectives on continual pretraining through a research test bed as well as provide comprehensive guidance for effective continual model updates in such scenarios. We first introduce FoMo-in-Flux, a continual multimodal pretraining benchmark with realistic compute constraints and practical deployment requirements, constructed over 63 datasets with diverse visual and semantic coverage. Using FoMo-in-Flux, we explore the complex landscape of practical continual pretraining through multiple perspectives: (1) A data-centric investigation of data mixtures and stream orderings that emulate real-world deployment situations, (2) a method-centric investigation ranging from simple fine-tuning and traditional continual learning strategies to parameter-efficient updates and model merging, (3) meta learning rate schedules and mechanistic design choices, and (4) the influence of model and compute scaling. Together, our insights provide a practitioner's guide to continual multimodal pretraining for real-world deployment.

Step-by-Step Unmasking for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning of Large Language Models,"Aradhye Agarwal, Suhas K Ramesh, Ayan Sengupta, Tanmoy Chakraborty","Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks requires substantial computational resources. A class of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate these computational challenges by selectively fine-tuning only a small fraction of the model parameters. Although computationally efficient, these techniques often fail to match the performance of fully fine-tuned models, primarily due to inherent biases introduced during parameter selection. Traditional selective PEFT techniques use a fixed set of parameters based on a predefined budget (a process also known as unmasking), failing to capture parameter importance dynamically and often ending up exceeding the budget. We introduce $\text{ID}^3$, a novel selective PEFT method that calculates parameter importance continually and dynamically unmasks parameters by balancing exploration and exploitation in parameter selection. Our empirical study on 15 tasks spanning natural language understanding and generative tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method compared to fixed-masking-based PEFT techniques. We analytically show that $\text{ID}^3$ reduces the number of gradient updates by a factor of two, enhancing computational efficiency. $\text{ID}^3$ is robust to random initialization of neurons and, therefore, can be seamlessly integrated into existing additive and reparametrization-based PEFT modules such as adapters and LoRA for dynamic sparsification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14470v2,2024-08
Explicit Inductive Inference using Large Language Models,"Tianyang Liu, Tianyi Li, Liang Cheng, Mark Steedman","Large Language Models (LLMs) are reported to hold undesirable attestation bias on inference tasks: when asked to predict if a premise P entails a hypothesis H, instead of considering H's conditional truthfulness entailed by P, LLMs tend to use the out-of-context truth label of H as a fragile proxy. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that exploits this bias to do explicit inductive inference. Our pipeline uses an LLM to transform a premise into a set of attested alternatives, and then aggregate answers of the derived new entailment inquiries to support the original inference prediction. On a directional predicate entailment benchmark, we demonstrate that by applying this simple pipeline, we can improve the overall performance of LLMs on inference and substantially alleviate the impact of their attestation bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14467v1,2024-08
Evaluating Large Language Models on Spatial Tasks: A Multi-Task Benchmarking Study,"Liuchang Xu, Shuo Zhao, Qingming Lin, Luyao Chen, Qianqian Luo, Sensen Wu, Xinyue Ye, Hailin Feng, Zhenhong Du","The emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and others highlights the importance of evaluating their diverse capabilities, ranging from natural language understanding to code generation. However, their performance on spatial tasks has not been thoroughly assessed. This study addresses this gap by introducing a new multi-task spatial evaluation dataset designed to systematically explore and compare the performance of several advanced models on spatial tasks. The dataset includes twelve distinct task types, such as spatial understanding and simple route planning, each with verified and accurate answers. We evaluated multiple models, including OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4o, ZhipuAI's glm-4, Anthropic's claude-3-sonnet-20240229, and MoonShot's moonshot-v1-8k, using a two-phase testing approach. First, we conducted zero-shot testing. Then, we categorized the dataset by difficulty and performed prompt-tuning tests. Results show that gpt-4o achieved the highest overall accuracy in the first phase, with an average of 71.3%. Although moonshot-v1-8k slightly underperformed overall, it outperformed gpt-4o in place name recognition tasks. The study also highlights the impact of prompt strategies on model performance in specific tasks. For instance, the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy increased gpt-4o's accuracy in simple route planning from 12.4% to 87.5%, while a one-shot strategy improved moonshot-v1-8k's accuracy in mapping tasks from 10.1% to 76.3%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14438v4,2024-08
CHARTOM: A Visual Theory-of-Mind Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models,"Shubham Bharti, Shiyun Cheng, Jihyun Rho, Martina Rao, Xiaojin Zhu","We introduce CHARTOM, a visual theory-of-mind benchmark for multimodal large language models. CHARTOM consists of specially designed data visualizing charts. Given a chart, a language model needs to not only correctly comprehend the chart (the FACT question) but also judge if the chart will be misleading to a human reader (the MIND question). Both questions have significant societal benefits. We detail the construction of the CHARTOM benchmark including its calibration on human performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14419v1,2024-08
MEDSAGE: Enhancing Robustness of Medical Dialogue Summarization to ASR Errors with LLM-generated Synthetic Dialogues,"Kuluhan Binici, Abhinav Ramesh Kashyap, Viktor Schlegel, Andy T. Liu, Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Thanh-Tung Nguyen, Xiaoxue Gao, Nancy F. Chen, Stefan Winkler","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are pivotal in transcribing speech into text, yet the errors they introduce can significantly degrade the performance of downstream tasks like summarization. This issue is particularly pronounced in clinical dialogue summarization, a low-resource domain where supervised data for fine-tuning is scarce, necessitating the use of ASR models as black-box solutions. Employing conventional data augmentation for enhancing the noise robustness of summarization models is not feasible either due to the unavailability of sufficient medical dialogue audio recordings and corresponding ASR transcripts. To address this challenge, we propose MEDSAGE, an approach for generating synthetic samples for data augmentation using Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we leverage the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs and instruct them to generate ASR-like errors based on a few available medical dialogue examples with audio recordings. Experimental results show that LLMs can effectively model ASR noise, and incorporating this noisy data into the training process significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of medical dialogue summarization systems. This approach addresses the challenges of noisy ASR outputs in critical applications, offering a robust solution to enhance the reliability of clinical dialogue summarization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14418v3,2024-08
Investigating Language-Specific Calibration For Pruning Multilingual Large Language Models,"Simon Kurz, Jian-Jia Chen, Lucie Flek, Zhixue Zhao","Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pruning have shown state-of-the-art (SotA) compression results in post-training and retraining-free settings while maintaining high predictive performance. However, previous research mainly considered calibrating based on English text, despite the multilingual nature of modern LLMs and their frequent use in non-English languages. In this paper, we set out to investigate calibrating the pruning of multilingual language models for monolingual applications. We present the first comprehensive empirical study, comparing different calibration languages for pruning multilingual models across diverse languages, tasks, models, and SotA pruning techniques. Our results offer practical suggestions, for example, calibrating in the target language can efficiently retain the language modeling capability but does not necessarily benefit downstream tasks. Through further analysis of latent subspaces, pruning masks, and individual neurons within pruned models, we find that while pruning generally preserves strong language-specific features, it may fail to retain language-specific neuron activation patterns and subtle, language-agnostic features associated with knowledge and reasoning that are needed for complex tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14398v3,2024-08
Uncovering Knowledge Gaps in Radiology Report Generation Models through Knowledge Graphs,"Xiaoman Zhang, Julián N. Acosta, Hong-Yu Zhou, Pranav Rajpurkar","Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly improved the automatic generation of radiology reports. However, existing evaluation methods fail to reveal the models' understanding of radiological images and their capacity to achieve human-level granularity in descriptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a system, named ReXKG, which extracts structured information from processed reports to construct a comprehensive radiology knowledge graph. We then propose three metrics to evaluate the similarity of nodes (ReXKG-NSC), distribution of edges (ReXKG-AMS), and coverage of subgraphs (ReXKG-SCS) across various knowledge graphs. We conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of AI-generated and human-written radiology reports, assessing the performance of both specialist and generalist models. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current AI models in radiology report generation, offering valuable insights for improving model performance and clinical applicability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14397v1,2024-08
Probing Causality Manipulation of Large Language Models,"Chenyang Zhang, Haibo Tong, Bin Zhang, Dongyu Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown various ability on natural language processing, including problems about causality. It is not intuitive for LLMs to command causality, since pretrained models usually work on statistical associations, and do not focus on causes and effects in sentences. So that probing internal manipulation of causality is necessary for LLMs. This paper proposes a novel approach to probe causality manipulation hierarchically, by providing different shortcuts to models and observe behaviors. We exploit retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL) for models on a designed causality classification task. We conduct experiments on mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4 and some smaller and domain-specific models. Our results suggest that LLMs can detect entities related to causality and recognize direct causal relationships. However, LLMs lack specialized cognition for causality, merely treating them as part of the global semantic of the sentence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14380v1,2024-08

As a first step toward multilingual support, we have developed a Java version of SWE-bench, called SWE-bench-java. We have publicly released the dataset, along with the corresponding Docker-based evaluation environment and leaderboard, which will be continuously maintained and updated in the coming months. To verify the reliability of SWE-bench-java, we implement a classic method SWE-agent and test several powerful LLMs on it. As is well known, developing a high-quality multi-lingual benchmark is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so we welcome contributions through pull requests or collaboration to accelerate its iteration and refinement, paving the way for fully automated programming.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14354v1,2024-08
Assessing Contamination in Large Language Models: Introducing the LogProber method,"Nicolas Yax, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Stefano Palminteri","In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. Most recent works in the field are not tailored to quantify contamination on short sequences of text like we find in psychology questionnaires. In the present paper we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient, algorithm that we show able to detect contamination using token probability in given sentences. In the second part we investigate the limitations of the method and discuss how different training methods can contaminate models without leaving traces in the token probabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14352v1,2024-08

This comprehensive review examines state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models and foundation models in music, spanning from representation learning, generative learning and multimodal learning. We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues. The paper offers insights into future challenges and trends on FMs for music, aiming to shape the trajectory of human-AI collaboration in the music realm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14340v3,2024-08
Claim Verification in the Age of Large Language Models: A Survey,"Alphaeus Dmonte, Roland Oruche, Marcos Zampieri, Prasad Calyam, Isabelle Augenstein","The large and ever-increasing amount of data available on the Internet coupled with the laborious task of manual claim and fact verification has sparked the interest in the development of automated claim verification systems. Several deep learning and transformer-based models have been proposed for this task over the years. With the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their superior performance in several NLP tasks, we have seen a surge of LLM-based approaches to claim verification along with the use of novel methods such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this survey, we present a comprehensive account of recent claim verification frameworks using LLMs. We describe the different components of the claim verification pipeline used in these frameworks in detail including common approaches to retrieval, prompting, and fine-tuning.

LLM-3D Print: Large Language Models To Monitor and Control 3D Printing,"Yayati Jadhav, Peter Pak, Amir Barati Farimani","Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14307v1,2024-08
Predictability and Causality in Spanish and English Natural Language Generation,"Andrea Busto-Castiñeira, Francisco J. González-Castaño, Silvia García-Méndez, Francisco de Arriba-Pérez","In recent years, the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has been boosted by the recent advances in deep learning technologies. Nonetheless, these new data-intensive methods introduce language-dependent disparities in NLG as the main training data sets are in English. Also, most neural NLG systems use decoder-only (causal) transformer language models, which work well for English, but were not designed with other languages in mind. In this work we depart from the hypothesis that they may introduce generation bias in target languages with less rigid word ordering, subject omission, or different attachment preferences for relative clauses, so that for these target languages other language generation strategies may be more desirable. This paper first compares causal and non-causal language modeling for English and Spanish, two languages with different grammatical structures and over 1.5 billion and 0.5 billion speakers, respectively. For this purpose, we define a novel metric of average causal and non-causal context-conditioned entropy of the grammatical category distribution for both languages as an information-theoretic a priori approach. The evaluation of natural text sources (such as training data) in both languages reveals lower average non-causal conditional entropy in Spanish and lower causal conditional entropy in English. According to this experiment, Spanish is more predictable than English given a non-causal context. Then, by applying a conditional relative entropy metric to text generation experiments, we obtain as insights that the best performance is respectively achieved with causal NLG in English, and with non-causal NLG in Spanish. These insights support further research in NLG in Spanish using bidirectional transformer language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14283v1,2024-08
Examining Independence in Ensemble Sentiment Analysis: A Study on the Limits of Large Language Models Using the Condorcet Jury Theorem,"Baptiste Lefort, Eric Benhamou, Jean-Jacques Ohana, Beatrice Guez, David Saltiel, Thomas Jacquot","This paper explores the application of the Condorcet Jury theorem to the domain of sentiment analysis, specifically examining the performance of various large language models (LLMs) compared to simpler natural language processing (NLP) models. The theorem posits that a majority vote classifier should enhance predictive accuracy, provided that individual classifiers' decisions are independent. Our empirical study tests this theoretical framework by implementing a majority vote mechanism across different models, including advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT 4. Contrary to expectations, the results reveal only marginal improvements in performance when incorporating larger models, suggesting a lack of independence among them. This finding aligns with the hypothesis that despite their complexity, LLMs do not significantly outperform simpler models in reasoning tasks within sentiment analysis, showing the practical limits of model independence in the context of advanced NLP tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00094v1,2024-08

Self-supervised Speech Representations Still Struggle with African American Vernacular English,"Kalvin Chang, Yi-Hui Chou, Jiatong Shi, Hsuan-Ming Chen, Nicole Holliday, Odette Scharenborg, David R. Mortensen","Underperformance of ASR systems for speakers of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and other marginalized language varieties is a well-documented phenomenon, and one that reinforces the stigmatization of these varieties. We investigate whether or not the recent wave of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) speech models can close the gap in ASR performance between AAVE and Mainstream American English (MAE). We evaluate four SSL models (wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and XLS-R) on zero-shot Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for these two varieties and find that these models perpetuate the bias in performance against AAVE. Additionally, the models have higher word error rates on utterances with more phonological and morphosyntactic features of AAVE. Despite the success of SSL speech models in improving ASR for low resource varieties, SSL pre-training alone may not bridge the gap between AAVE and MAE. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cmu-llab/s3m-aave.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14262v1,2024-08
An Evaluation of Explanation Methods for Black-Box Detectors of Machine-Generated Text,"Loris Schoenegger, Yuxi Xia, Benjamin Roth","The increasing difficulty to distinguish language-model-generated from human-written text has led to the development of detectors of machine-generated text (MGT). However, in many contexts, a black-box prediction is not sufficient, it is equally important to know on what grounds a detector made that prediction. Explanation methods that estimate feature importance promise to provide indications of which parts of an input are used by classifiers for prediction. However, the quality of different explanation methods has not previously been assessed for detectors of MGT. This study conducts the first systematic evaluation of explanation quality for this task. The dimensions of faithfulness and stability are assessed with five automated experiments, and usefulness is evaluated in a user study. We use a dataset of ChatGPT-generated and human-written documents, and pair predictions of three existing language-model-based detectors with the corresponding SHAP, LIME, and Anchor explanations. We find that SHAP performs best in terms of faithfulness, stability, and in helping users to predict the detector's behavior. In contrast, LIME, perceived as most useful by users, scores the worst in terms of user performance at predicting the detectors' behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14252v1,2024-08

PatentGPT: A Large Language Model for Patent Drafting Using Knowledge-based Fine-tuning Method,"Runtao Ren, Jian Ma","As humanity stands on the brink of a new era of technological innovation, the ability to rapidly transform creative ideas into protected intellectual property (IP) is more crucial than ever. However, the conventional processes for patent drafting are fraught with challenges, demanding a nuanced understanding of advanced field knowledge and technical concepts. Existing large language models (LLMs), while powerful, often fall short in this IP creation domain due to their lack of specialized knowledge and context-awareness necessary for generating technically accurate patent documents. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a groundbreaking framework for Knowledge Fine-Tuning (KFT) of LLMs, designed to endow AI with the ability to autonomously mine, understand, and apply domain-specific knowledge. Our model, PatentGPT leverages a unique combination of knowledge graph-based pre-training, domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Through extensive evaluation, PatentGPT has demonstrated outstanding performance, scoring up to approximately 400% higher in patent related benchmark tests compared to state-of-the-art models. By KFT method the model's capability to not only assist but also augment human creativity and innovation, our approach sets a new standard for AI-driven intellectual property generation, paving the way for more efficient and effective invention processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00092v1,2024-08
Investigating the effect of Mental Models in User Interaction with an Adaptive Dialog Agent,"Lindsey Vanderlyn, Dirk Väth, Ngoc Thang Vu","Mental models play an important role in whether user interaction with intelligent systems, such as dialog systems is successful or not. Adaptive dialog systems present the opportunity to align a dialog agent's behavior with heterogeneous user expectations. However, there has been little research into what mental models users form when interacting with a task-oriented dialog system, how these models affect users' interactions, or what role system adaptation can play in this process, making it challenging to avoid damage to human-AI partnership. In this work, we collect a new publicly available dataset for exploring user mental models about information seeking dialog systems. We demonstrate that users have a variety of conflicting mental models about such systems, the validity of which directly impacts the success of their interactions and perceived usability of system. Furthermore, we show that adapting a dialog agent's behavior to better align with users' mental models, even when done implicitly, can improve perceived usability, dialog efficiency, and success. To this end, we argue that implicit adaptation can be a valid strategy for task-oriented dialog systems, so long as developers first have a solid understanding of users' mental models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14154v1,2024-08
Explaining Vision-Language Similarities in Dual Encoders with Feature-Pair Attributions,"Lucas Möller, Pascal Tilli, Ngoc Thang Vu, Sebastian Padó","Dual encoder architectures like CLIP models map two types of inputs into a shared embedding space and learn similarities between them. However, it is not understood how such models compare two inputs. Here, we address this research gap with two contributions. First, we derive a method to attribute predictions of any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-pair interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to CLIP-type models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes and also account for mismatches. However, this visual-linguistic grounding ability heavily varies between object classes, depends on the training data distribution, and largely improves after in-domain training. Using our method we can identify knowledge gaps about specific object classes in individual models and can monitor their improvement upon fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14153v1,2024-08
Crowd-Calibrator: Can Annotator Disagreement Inform Calibration in Subjective Tasks?,"Urja Khurana, Eric Nalisnick, Antske Fokkens, Swabha Swayamdipta","Subjective tasks in NLP have been mostly relegated to objective standards, where the gold label is decided by taking the majority vote. This obfuscates annotator disagreement and the inherent uncertainty of the label. We argue that subjectivity should factor into model decisions and play a direct role via calibration under a selective prediction setting. Specifically, instead of calibrating confidence purely from the model's perspective, we calibrate models for subjective tasks based on crowd worker agreement. Our method, Crowd-Calibrator, models the distance between the distribution of crowd worker labels and the model's own distribution over labels to inform whether the model should abstain from a decision. On two highly subjective tasks, hate speech detection and natural language inference, our experiments show Crowd-Calibrator either outperforms or achieves competitive performance with existing selective prediction baselines. Our findings highlight the value of bringing human decision-making into model predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14141v1,2024-08
Multi-Faceted Evaluation of Modeling Languages for Augmented Reality Applications -- The Case of ARWFML,"Fabian Muff, Hans-Georg Fill","The evaluation of modeling languages for augmented reality applications poses particular challenges due to the three-dimensional environment they target. The previously introduced Augmented Reality Workflow Modeling Language (ARWFML) enables the model-based creation of augmented reality scenarios without programming knowledge. Building upon the first design cycle of the language's specification, this paper presents two further design iterations for refining the language based on multi-faceted evaluations. These include a comparative evaluation of implementation options and workflow capabilities, the introduction of a 3D notation, and the development of a new 3D modeling environment.

Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for Heterophilic Graphs,"Yuxia Wu, Shujie Li, Yuan Fang, Chuan Shi","Large language models (LLMs) have presented significant opportunities to enhance various machine learning applications, including graph neural networks (GNNs). By leveraging the vast open-world knowledge within LLMs, we can more effectively interpret and utilize textual data to better characterize heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often have different labels. However, existing approaches for heterophilic graphs overlook the rich textual data associated with nodes, which could unlock deeper insights into their heterophilic contexts. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for modeling heterophilic graphs and propose a novel two-stage framework: LLM-enhanced edge discriminator and LLM-guided edge reweighting. In the first stage, we fine-tune the LLM to better identify homophilic and heterophilic edges based on the textual content of their nodes. In the second stage, we adaptively manage message propagation in GNNs for different edge types based on node features, structures, and heterophilic or homophilic characteristics. To cope with the computational demands when deploying LLMs in practical scenarios, we further explore model distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller, more efficient models that maintain competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance node classification on heterophilic graphs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14134v2,2024-08
Contrastive Learning Subspace for Text Clustering,"Qian Yong, Chen Chen, Xiabing Zhou","Contrastive learning has been frequently investigated to learn effective representations for text clustering tasks. While existing contrastive learning-based text clustering methods only focus on modeling instance-wise semantic similarity relationships, they ignore contextual information and underlying relationships among all instances that needs to be clustered. In this paper, we propose a novel text clustering approach called Subspace Contrastive Learning (SCL) which models cluster-wise relationships among instances. Specifically, the proposed SCL consists of two main modules: (1) a self-expressive module that constructs virtual positive samples and (2) a contrastive learning module that further learns a discriminative subspace to capture task-specific cluster-wise relationships among texts. Experimental results show that the proposed SCL method not only has achieved superior results on multiple task clustering datasets but also has less complexity in positive sample construction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14119v1,2024-08

The paper discusses experiments performed to classify a labeled SCR dataset and evaluates the performance of the classifier. It explores the construction of several prompt variations and their observed effects on the LLM's decision-making process.

Evaluating ChatGPT on Nuclear Domain-Specific Data,"Muhammad Anwar, Mischa de Costa, Issam Hammad, Daniel Lau","This paper examines the application of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), for question-and-answer (Q&A) tasks in the highly specialized field of nuclear data. The primary focus is on evaluating ChatGPT's performance on a curated test dataset, comparing the outcomes of a standalone LLM with those generated through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. LLMs, despite their recent advancements, are prone to generating incorrect or 'hallucinated' information, which is a significant limitation in applications requiring high accuracy and reliability. This study explores the potential of utilizing RAG in LLMs, a method that integrates external knowledge bases and sophisticated retrieval techniques to enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated outputs. In this context, the paper evaluates ChatGPT's ability to answer domain-specific questions, employing two methodologies: A) direct response from the LLM, and B) response from the LLM within a RAG framework. The effectiveness of these methods is assessed through a dual mechanism of human and LLM evaluation, scoring the responses for correctness and other metrics. The findings underscore the improvement in performance when incorporating a RAG pipeline in an LLM, particularly in generating more accurate and contextually appropriate responses for nuclear domain-specific queries. Additionally, the paper highlights alternative approaches to further refine and improve the quality of answers in such specialized domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00090v1,2024-08
Enhancing Depression Diagnosis with Chain-of-Thought Prompting,"Elysia Shi, Adithri Manda, London Chowdhury, Runeema Arun, Kevin Zhu, Michael Lam","When using AI to detect signs of depressive disorder, AI models habitually draw preemptive conclusions. We theorize that using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to evaluate Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) scores will improve the accuracy of the scores determined by AI models. In our findings, when the models reasoned with CoT, the estimated PHQ-8 scores were consistently closer on average to the accepted true scores reported by each participant compared to when not using CoT. Our goal is to expand upon AI models' understanding of the intricacies of human conversation, allowing them to more effectively assess a patient's feelings and tone, therefore being able to more accurately discern mental disorder symptoms; ultimately, we hope to augment AI models' abilities, so that they can be widely accessible and used in the medical field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14053v2,2024-08

Motivated by this, we present a new systematic framework, autonomous Machine Learning Research with large language models (MLR-Copilot), designed to enhance machine learning research productivity through the automatic generation and implementation of research ideas using Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The framework consists of three phases: research idea generation, experiment implementation, and implementation execution. First, existing research papers are used to generate hypotheses and experimental plans vis IdeaAgent powered by LLMs. Next, the implementation generation phase translates these plans into executables with ExperimentAgent. This phase leverages retrieved prototype code and optionally retrieves candidate models and data. Finally, the execution phase, also managed by ExperimentAgent, involves running experiments with mechanisms for human feedback and iterative debugging to enhance the likelihood of achieving executable research outcomes. We evaluate our framework on five machine learning research tasks and the experimental results show the framework's potential to facilitate the research progress and innovations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14033v2,2024-08

We validate our approach with a new benchmark, IndicYT, comprising diverse YouTube audio files from multiple content categories. Our findings show that augmenting pseudo labeled data from YouTube with existing training data leads to significant performance improvements on IndicYT, without affecting performance on out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of pseudo-labeled data in enhancing ASR capabilities for low-resource languages. The benchmark, code and models developed as a part of this work will be made publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14026v1,2024-08

Question answering system of bridge design specification based on large language model,"Leye Zhang, Xiangxiang Tian, Hongjun Zhang","This paper constructs question answering system for bridge design specification based on large language model. Three implementation schemes are tried: full fine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model, parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model, and self-built language model from scratch. Through the self-built question and answer task dataset, based on the tensorflow and keras deep learning platform framework, the model is constructed and trained to predict the start position and end position of the answer in the bridge design specification given by the user. The experimental results show that full fine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model achieves 100% accuracy in the training-dataset, validation-dataset and test-dataset, and the system can extract the answers from the bridge design specification given by the user to answer various questions of the user; While parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model and self-built language model from scratch perform well in the training-dataset, their generalization ability in the test-dataset needs to be improved. The research of this paper provides a useful reference for the development of question answering system in professional field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13282v1,2024-08
Focused Large Language Models are Stable Many-Shot Learners,"Peiwen Yuan, Shaoxiong Feng, Yiwei Li, Xinglin Wang, Yueqi Zhang, Chuyi Tan, Boyuan Pan, Heda Wang, Yao Hu, Kan Li","In-Context Learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to achieve rapid task adaptation by learning from demonstrations. With the increase in available context length of LLMs, recent experiments have shown that the performance of ICL does not necessarily scale well in many-shot (demonstration) settings. We theoretically and experimentally confirm that the reason lies in more demonstrations dispersing the model attention from the query, hindering its understanding of key content. Inspired by how humans learn from examples, we propose a training-free method FocusICL, which conducts triviality filtering to avoid attention being diverted by unimportant contents at token-level and operates hierarchical attention to further ensure sufficient attention towards current query at demonstration-level. We also design an efficient hyperparameter searching strategy for FocusICL based on model perplexity of demonstrations. Comprehensive experiments validate that FocusICL achieves an average performance improvement of 5.2% over vanilla ICL and scales well with many-shot demonstrations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13987v1,2024-08
AgentMove: Predicting Human Mobility Anywhere Using Large Language Model based Agentic Framework,"Jie Feng, Yuwei Du, Jie Zhao, Yong Li","Human mobility prediction plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Although deep learning based models have shown promising results over the past decade, their reliance on extensive private mobility data for training and their inability to perform zero-shot predictions, have hindered further advancements. Recently, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to mobility prediction task. However, their performance has been constrained by the absence of a systematic design of workflow. They directly generate the final output using LLMs, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized mobility prediction for any cities worldwide. In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task into three sub-tasks and then design corresponding modules to complete these subtasks, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments on mobility data from two sources in 12 cities demonstrate that AgentMove outperforms the best baseline more than 8% in various metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities. Codes and data can be found in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentMove.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13986v1,2024-08
TF-Attack: Transferable and Fast Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models,"Zelin Li, Kehai Chen, Lemao Liu, Xuefeng Bai, Mingming Yang, Yang Xiang, Min Zhang","With the great advancements in large language models (LLMs), adversarial attacks against LLMs have recently attracted increasing attention. We found that pre-existing adversarial attack methodologies exhibit limited transferability and are notably inefficient, particularly when applied to LLMs. In this paper, we analyze the core mechanisms of previous predominant adversarial attack methods, revealing that 1) the distributions of importance score differ markedly among victim models, restricting the transferability; 2) the sequential attack processes induces substantial time overheads. Based on the above two insights, we introduce a new scheme, named TF-Attack, for Transferable and Fast adversarial attacks on LLMs. TF-Attack employs an external LLM as a third-party overseer rather than the victim model to identify critical units within sentences. Moreover, TF-Attack introduces the concept of Importance Level, which allows for parallel substitutions of attacks. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 widely adopted benchmarks, evaluating the proposed method through both automatic and human metrics. Results show that our method consistently surpasses previous methods in transferability and delivers significant speed improvements, up to 20 times faster than earlier attack strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13985v3,2024-08
Nemesis: Normalizing the Soft-prompt Vectors of Vision-Language Models,"Shuai Fu, Xiequn Wang, Qiushi Huang, Yu Zhang","With the prevalence of large-scale pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, soft-prompt tuning has become a popular method for adapting these models to various downstream tasks. However, few works delve into the inherent properties of learnable soft-prompt vectors, specifically the impact of their norms to the performance of VLMs. This motivates us to pose an unexplored research question: ``Do we need to normalize the soft prompts in VLMs?'' To fill this research gap, we first uncover a phenomenon, called the \textbf{Low-Norm Effect} by performing extensive corruption experiments, suggesting that reducing the norms of certain learned prompts occasionally enhances the performance of VLMs, while increasing them often degrades it. To harness this effect, we propose a novel method named \textbf{N}ormalizing th\textbf{e} soft-pro\textbf{m}pt v\textbf{e}ctors of vi\textbf{si}on-language model\textbf{s} (\textbf{Nemesis}) to normalize soft-prompt vectors in VLMs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to systematically investigate the role of norms of soft-prompt vector in VLMs, offering valuable insights for future research in soft-prompt tuning.

Reducing the Cost: Cross-Prompt Pre-Finetuning for Short Answer Scoring,"Hiroaki Funayama, Yuya Asazuma, Yuichiroh Matsubayashi, Tomoya Mizumoto, Kentaro Inui","Automated Short Answer Scoring (SAS) is the task of automatically scoring a given input to a prompt based on rubrics and reference answers. Although SAS is useful in real-world applications, both rubrics and reference answers differ between prompts, thus requiring a need to acquire new data and train a model for each new prompt. Such requirements are costly, especially for schools and online courses where resources are limited and only a few prompts are used. In this work, we attempt to reduce this cost through a two-phase approach: train a model on existing rubrics and answers with gold score signals and finetune it on a new prompt. Specifically, given that scoring rubrics and reference answers differ for each prompt, we utilize key phrases, or representative expressions that the answer should contain to increase scores, and train a SAS model to learn the relationship between key phrases and answers using already annotated prompts (i.e., cross-prompts). Our experimental results show that finetuning on existing cross-prompt data with key phrases significantly improves scoring accuracy, especially when the training data is limited. Finally, our extensive analysis shows that it is crucial to design the model so that it can learn the task's general property.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13966v1,2024-08
Bidirectional Awareness Induction in Autoregressive Seq2Seq Models,"Jia Cheng Hu, Roberto Cavicchioli, Alessandro Capotondi","Autoregressive Sequence-To-Sequence models are the foundation of many Deep Learning achievements in major research fields such as Vision and Natural Language Processing. Despite that, they still present significant limitations. For instance, when errors occur in the early steps of the prediction, the whole output is severely affected. Such reliance on previously predicted tokens and the inherent computational unfriendliness of sequential algorithms, motivated researchers to explore different architectures and methods in the search for bidirectional approaches. In this work, we introduce the Bidirectional Awareness Induction (BAI), a training method that leverages a subset of elements in the network, the Pivots, to perform bidirectional learning without breaking the autoregressive constraints. To showcase its flexibility, we apply the method to three architectures, the Transformer, ExpansionNet v2 and GPT, then perform experiments over three tasks. Experimental results showcase BAI's effectiveness on all selected tasks and architectures. In particular, we observed an increase of up to 2.4 CIDEr in Image-Captioning, 4.96 BLEU in Neural Machine Translation, and 1.16 ROUGE in Text Summarization compared to the respective baselines. Notably, BAI not only has a positive impact on models trained from scratch but on pre-trained models as well. Such an aspect, combined with the absence of architectural requirements synergizes well with the current trend of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13959v1,2024-08
"Prediction of COPD Using Machine Learning, Clinical Summary Notes, and Vital Signs",Negar Orangi-Fard,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. In the United States, more than 15.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, with 96% of individuals living with at least one other chronic health condition. It is the 4th leading cause of death in the country. Over 2.2 million patients are admitted to hospitals annually due to COPD exacerbations. Monitoring and predicting patient exacerbations on-time could save their life. This paper presents two different predictive models to predict COPD exacerbation using AI and natural language processing (NLP) approaches. These models use respiration summary notes, symptoms, and vital signs. To train and test these models, data records containing physiologic signals and vital signs time series were used. These records were captured from patient monitors and comprehensive clinical data obtained from hospital medical information systems for tens of thousands of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. We achieved an area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.82 in detection and prediction of COPD exacerbation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13958v2,2024-08
CoT Rerailer: Enhancing the Reliability of Large Language Models in Complex Reasoning Tasks through Error Detection and Correction,"Guangya Wan, Yuqi Wu, Jie Chen, Sheng Li","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) complex reasoning abilities by generating intermediate steps. However, these steps can introduce hallucinations and accumulate errors. We propose the CoT Rerailer to address these challenges, employing self-consistency and multi-agent debate systems to identify and rectify errors in the reasoning process. The CoT Rerailer first selects the most logically correct Reasoning Path (RP) using consistency checks and critical evaluation by automated agents. It then engages a multi-agent debate system to propose and validate corrections to ensure the generation of an error-free intermediate logical path. The corrected steps are then used to generate a revised reasoning chain to further reduce hallucinations and enhance answer quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse question-answering datasets in various knowledge domains. The CoT Rerailer enhances the reliability of LLM-generated reasoning, contributing to more trustworthy AI driven decision-making processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13940v2,2024-08
MobileQuant: Mobile-friendly Quantization for On-device Language Models,"Fuwen Tan, Royson Lee, Łukasz Dudziak, Shell Xu Hu, Sourav Bhattacharya, Timothy Hospedales, Georgios Tzimiropoulos, Brais Martinez","Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized language processing, delivering outstanding results across multiple applications. However, deploying LLMs on edge devices poses several challenges with respect to memory, energy, and compute costs, limiting their widespread use in devices such as mobile phones. A promising solution is to reduce the number of bits used to represent weights and activations. While existing works have found partial success at quantizing LLMs to lower bitwidths, e.g. 4-bit weights, quantizing activations beyond 16 bits often leads to large computational overheads due to poor on-device quantization support, or a considerable accuracy drop. Yet, 8-bit activations are very attractive for on-device deployment as they would enable LLMs to fully exploit mobile-friendly hardware, e.g. Neural Processing Units (NPUs). In this work, we make a first attempt to facilitate the on-device deployment of LLMs using integer-only quantization. We first investigate the limitations of existing quantization methods for on-device deployment, with a special focus on activation quantization. We then address these limitations by introducing a simple post-training quantization method, named MobileQuant, that extends previous weight equivalent transformation works by jointly optimizing the weight transformation and activation range parameters in an end-to-end manner. MobileQuant demonstrates superior capabilities over existing methods by 1) achieving near-lossless quantization on a wide range of LLM benchmarks, 2) reducing latency and energy consumption by 20\%-50\% compared to current on-device quantization strategies, 3) requiring limited compute budget, 4) being compatible with mobile-friendly compute units, e.g. NPU.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13933v2,2024-08
Genetic Approach to Mitigate Hallucination in Generative IR,"Hrishikesh Kulkarni, Nazli Goharian, Ophir Frieder, Sean MacAvaney","Generative language models hallucinate. That is, at times, they generate factually flawed responses. These inaccuracies are particularly insidious because the responses are fluent and well-articulated. We focus on the task of Grounded Answer Generation (part of Generative IR), which aims to produce direct answers to a user's question based on results retrieved from a search engine. We address hallucination by adapting an existing genetic generation approach with a new 'balanced fitness function' consisting of a cross-encoder model for relevance and an n-gram overlap metric to promote grounding. Our balanced fitness function approach quadruples the grounded answer generation accuracy while maintaining high relevance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00085v1,2024-08
LLMs are Superior Feedback Providers: Bootstrapping Reasoning for Lie Detection with Self-Generated Feedback,"Tanushree Banerjee, Richard Zhu, Runzhe Yang, Karthik Narasimhan","Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like dialogues and comprehending text. However, understanding the subtleties of complex exchanges in language remains a challenge. We propose a bootstrapping framework that leverages self-generated feedback to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for lie detection. The framework consists of three stages: suggestion, feedback collection, and modification. In the suggestion stage, a cost-effective language model generates initial predictions based on game state and dialogue. The feedback-collection stage involves a language model providing feedback on these predictions. In the modification stage, a more advanced language model refines the initial predictions using the auto-generated feedback. We investigate the application of the proposed framework for detecting betrayal and deception in Diplomacy games, and compare it with feedback from professional human players. The LLM-generated feedback exhibits superior quality and significantly enhances the performance of the model. Our approach achieves a 39% improvement over the zero-shot baseline in lying-F1 without the need for any training data, rivaling state-of-the-art supervised learning results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13915v1,2024-08
LowCLIP: Adapting the CLIP Model Architecture for Low-Resource Languages in Multimodal Image Retrieval Task,"Ali Asgarov, Samir Rustamov","This research explores the development of multimodal vision-language models for image retrieval in low-resource languages, specifically Azerbaijani. Existing vision-language models primarily support high-resource languages, and fine-tuning them remains computationally demanding. To address challenges in vision-language retrieval for low-resource languages, we integrated the CLIP model architecture and employed several techniques to balance computational efficiency with performance. These techniques include synthetic data generation through machine translation, image augmentation, and further training the attention mechanisms of transformer-based models with domain-specific data. We integrated Multilingual BERT as a text encoder with image encoders like ResNet50, EfficientNet0, Vision Transformer (ViT), and Tiny Swin Transformer. Our study found that models like EfficientNet0 and Tiny Swin Transformer perform best on the datasets they were trained on, such as COCO, Flickr30k, and Flickr8k. Augmentation techniques boosted EfficientNet0 MAP on Flickr30k from 0.84 to 0.87 and ResNet50 MAP on MSCOCO from 0.70 to 0.80, contributing to a new state of the art in vision-language retrieval. We share our configurations and results to support further research. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/aliasgerovs/azclip.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13909v1,2024-08
SimpleSpeech 2: Towards Simple and Efficient Text-to-Speech with Flow-based Scalar Latent Transformer Diffusion Models,"Dongchao Yang, Rongjie Huang, Yuanyuan Wang, Haohan Guo, Dading Chong, Songxiang Liu, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng","Scaling Text-to-speech (TTS) to large-scale datasets has been demonstrated as an effective method for improving the diversity and naturalness of synthesized speech. At the high level, previous large-scale TTS models can be categorized into either Auto-regressive (AR) based (\textit{e.g.}, VALL-E) or Non-auto-regressive (NAR) based models (\textit{e.g.}, NaturalSpeech 2/3). Although these works demonstrate good performance, they still have potential weaknesses. For instance, AR-based models are plagued by unstable generation quality and slow generation speed; meanwhile, some NAR-based models need phoneme-level duration alignment information, thereby increasing the complexity of data pre-processing, model design, and loss design. In this work, we build upon our previous publication by implementing a simple and efficient non-autoregressive (NAR) TTS framework, termed SimpleSpeech 2. SimpleSpeech 2 effectively combines the strengths of both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) methods, offering the following key advantages: (1) simplified data preparation; (2) straightforward model and loss design; and (3) stable, high-quality generation performance with fast inference speed. Compared to our previous publication, we present ({\romannumeral1}) a detailed analysis of the influence of speech tokenizer and noisy label for TTS performance; ({\romannumeral2}) four distinct types of sentence duration predictors; ({\romannumeral3}) a novel flow-based scalar latent transformer diffusion model. With these improvement, we show a significant improvement in generation performance and generation speed compared to our previous work and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) large-scale TTS models. Furthermore, we show that SimpleSpeech 2 can be seamlessly extended to multilingual TTS by training it on multilingual speech datasets. Demos are available on: {https://dongchaoyang.top/SimpleSpeech2\_demo/}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13893v2,2024-08
SpeechCaps: Advancing Instruction-Based Universal Speech Models with Multi-Talker Speaking Style Captioning,"Chien-yu Huang, Min-Han Shih, Ke-Han Lu, Chi-Yuan Hsiao, Hung-yi Lee","Instruction-based speech processing is becoming popular. Studies show that training with multiple tasks boosts performance, but collecting diverse, large-scale tasks and datasets is expensive. Thus, it is highly desirable to design a fundamental task that benefits other downstream tasks. This paper introduces a multi-talker speaking style captioning task to enhance the understanding of speaker and prosodic information. We used large language models to generate descriptions for multi-talker speech. Then, we trained our model with pre-training on this captioning task followed by instruction tuning. Evaluation on Dynamic-SUPERB shows our model outperforming the baseline pre-trained only on single-talker tasks, particularly in speaker and emotion recognition. Additionally, tests on a multi-talker QA task reveal that current models struggle with attributes such as gender, pitch, and speaking rate.

LLM with Relation Classifier for Document-Level Relation Extraction,"Xingzuo Li, Kehai Chen, Yunfei Long, Min Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have created a new paradigm for natural language processing. Despite their advancement, LLM-based methods still lag behind traditional approaches in document-level relation extraction (DocRE), a critical task for understanding complex entity relations within long context. This paper investigates the causes of this performance gap, identifying the dispersion of attention by LLMs due to entity pairs without relations as a key factor. We then introduce a novel classifier-LLM approach to DocRE. Particularly, the proposed approach begins with a classifier designed to select entity pair candidates that exhibit potential relations and then feed them to LLM for final relation classification. This method ensures that the LLM's attention is directed at relation-expressing entity pairs instead of those without relations during inference. Experiments on DocRE benchmarks reveal that our method significantly outperforms recent LLM-based DocRE models and narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art BERT-based models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13889v2,2024-08
CodeGraph: Enhancing Graph Reasoning of LLMs with Code,"Qiaolong Cai, Zhaowei Wang, Shizhe Diao, James Kwok, Yangqiu Song","With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs), reasoning on basic graph algorithm problems is an essential intermediate step in assessing their abilities to process and infer complex graph reasoning tasks. Existing methods usually convert graph-structured data to textual descriptions and then use LLMs for reasoning and computation. However, LLMs often produce computation errors on arithmetic parts in basic graph algorithm problems, such as counting number of edges. In addition, they struggle to control or understand the output of the reasoning process, raising concerns about whether LLMs are simply guessing. In this paper, we introduce CodeGraph, a method that encodes graph problem solutions as code. The methods solve new graph problems by learning from exemplars, generating programs, and executing them via a program interpreter. Using the few-shot setting, we evaluate CodeGraph with the base LLM being GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama3-70B Instruct, Mixtral-8x22B Instruct, and Mixtral-8x7B Instruct. Experimental results on six tasks with six graph encoding methods in the GraphQA dataset demonstrate that CodeGraph can boost performance on graph reasoning tasks inside LLMs by 1.3% to 58.6%, depending on the task. Compared to the existing methods, CodeGraph demonstrates strong performance on arithmetic problems in graph tasks and offers a more controllable and interpretable approach to the reasoning process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13863v1,2024-08
Knowledge-Aware Reasoning over Multimodal Semi-structured Tables,"Suyash Vardhan Mathur, Jainit Sushil Bafna, Kunal Kartik, Harshita Khandelwal, Manish Shrivastava, Vivek Gupta, Mohit Bansal, Dan Roth","Existing datasets for tabular question answering typically focus exclusively on text within cells. However, real-world data is inherently multimodal, often blending images such as symbols, faces, icons, patterns, and charts with textual content in tables. With the evolution of AI models capable of multimodal reasoning, it is pertinent to assess their efficacy in handling such structured data. This study investigates whether current AI models can perform knowledge-aware reasoning on multimodal structured data. We explore their ability to reason on tables that integrate both images and text, introducing MMTabQA, a new dataset designed for this purpose. Our experiments highlight substantial challenges for current AI models in effectively integrating and interpreting multiple text and image inputs, understanding visual context, and comparing visual content across images. These findings establish our dataset as a robust benchmark for advancing AI's comprehension and capabilities in analyzing multimodal structured data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13860v1,2024-08

Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4o, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline.   Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming the top open-source models: Llama3.1-405b (64%), Llama3.1-70b (58.3%), and Mixtral-8x7b (54.3%). Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2-7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2-9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by human-crafted image descriptions.   Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00084v2,2024-08
Biomedical Large Languages Models Seem not to be Superior to Generalist Models on Unseen Medical Data,"Felix J. Dorfner, Amin Dada, Felix Busch, Marcus R. Makowski, Tianyu Han, Daniel Truhn, Jens Kleesiek, Madhumita Sushil, Jacqueline Lammert, Lisa C. Adams, Keno K. Bressem","Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in biomedical applications, leading to efforts to fine-tune them on domain-specific data. However, the effectiveness of this approach remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance of biomedically fine-tuned LLMs against their general-purpose counterparts on a variety of clinical tasks. We evaluated their performance on clinical case challenges from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and on several clinical tasks (e.g., information extraction, document summarization, and clinical coding). Using benchmarks specifically chosen to be likely outside the fine-tuning datasets of biomedical models, we found that biomedical LLMs mostly perform inferior to their general-purpose counterparts, especially on tasks not focused on medical knowledge. While larger models showed similar performance on case tasks (e.g., OpenBioLLM-70B: 66.4% vs. Llama-3-70B-Instruct: 65% on JAMA cases), smaller biomedical models showed more pronounced underperformance (e.g., OpenBioLLM-8B: 30% vs. Llama-3-8B-Instruct: 64.3% on NEJM cases). Similar trends were observed across the CLUE (Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark tasks, with general-purpose models often performing better on text generation, question answering, and coding tasks. Our results suggest that fine-tuning LLMs to biomedical data may not provide the expected benefits and may potentially lead to reduced performance, challenging prevailing assumptions about domain-specific adaptation of LLMs and highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation frameworks in healthcare AI. Alternative approaches, such as retrieval-augmented generation, may be more effective in enhancing the biomedical capabilities of LLMs without compromising their general knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13833v1,2024-08
Guardians of the Machine Translation Meta-Evaluation: Sentinel Metrics Fall In!,"Stefano Perrella, Lorenzo Proietti, Alessandro Scirè, Edoardo Barba, Roberto Navigli","Annually, at the Conference of Machine Translation (WMT), the Metrics Shared Task organizers conduct the meta-evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) metrics, ranking them according to their correlation with human judgments. Their results guide researchers toward enhancing the next generation of metrics and MT systems. With the recent introduction of neural metrics, the field has witnessed notable advancements. Nevertheless, the inherent opacity of these metrics has posed substantial challenges to the meta-evaluation process. This work highlights two issues with the meta-evaluation framework currently employed in WMT, and assesses their impact on the metrics rankings. To do this, we introduce the concept of sentinel metrics, which are designed explicitly to scrutinize the meta-evaluation process's accuracy, robustness, and fairness. By employing sentinel metrics, we aim to validate our findings, and shed light on and monitor the potential biases or inconsistencies in the rankings. We discover that the present meta-evaluation framework favors two categories of metrics: i) those explicitly trained to mimic human quality assessments, and ii) continuous metrics. Finally, we raise concerns regarding the evaluation capabilities of state-of-the-art metrics, emphasizing that they might be basing their assessments on spurious correlations found in their training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13831v1,2024-08

Towards Reliable Medical Question Answering: Techniques and Challenges in Mitigating Hallucinations in Language Models,"Duy Khoa Pham, Bao Quoc Vo","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various domains, including healthcare and biomedicine. However, the phenomenon of hallucination, where LLMs generate outputs that deviate from factual accuracy or context, poses a critical challenge, especially in high-stakes domains. This paper conducts a scoping study of existing techniques for mitigating hallucinations in knowledge-based task in general and especially for medical domains. Key methods covered in the paper include Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based techniques, iterative feedback loops, supervised fine-tuning, and prompt engineering. These techniques, while promising in general contexts, require further adaptation and optimization for the medical domain due to its unique demands for up-to-date, specialized knowledge and strict adherence to medical guidelines. Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing trustworthy AI systems that enhance clinical decision-making and patient safety as well as accuracy of biomedical scientific research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13808v1,2024-08
DOCE: Finding the Sweet Spot for Execution-Based Code Generation,"Haau-Sing Li, Patrick Fernandes, Iryna Gurevych, André F. T. Martins","Recently, a diverse set of decoding and reranking procedures have been shown effective for LLM-based code generation. However, a comprehensive framework that links and experimentally compares these methods is missing. We address this by proposing Decoding Objectives for Code Execution, a comprehensive framework that includes candidate generation, $n$-best reranking, minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding, and self-debugging as the core components. We then study the contributions of these components through execution-based evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the importance of execution-based methods and the difference gap between execution-based and execution-free methods. Furthermore, we assess the impact of filtering based on trial unit tests, a simple and effective strategy that has been often overlooked in prior works. We also propose self-debugging on multiple candidates, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on reranking for code generation. We expect our framework to provide a solid guideline for future research on code generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13745v4,2024-08
Literary and Colloquial Tamil Dialect Identification,"M. Nanmalar, P. Vijayalakshmi, T. Nagarajan","Culture and language evolve together. The old literary form of Tamil is used commonly for writing and the contemporary colloquial Tamil is used for speaking. Human-computer interaction applications require Colloquial Tamil (CT) to make it more accessible and easy for the everyday user and, it requires Literary Tamil (LT) when information is needed in a formal written format. Continuing the use of LT alongside CT in computer aided language learning applications will both preserve LT, and provide ease of use via CT, at the same time. Hence there is a need for the conversion between LT and CT dialects, which demands as a first step, dialect identification. Dialect Identification (DID) of LT and CT is an unexplored area of research. In the current work, keeping the nuances of both these dialects in mind, five methods are explored which include two implicit methods - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); two explicit methods - Parallel Phone Recognition (PPR) and Parallel Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (P-LVCSR); two versions of the proposed explicit Unified Phone Recognition method (UPR-1 and UPR-2). These methods vary based on: the need for annotated data, the size of the unit, the way in which modelling is carried out, and the way in which the final decision is made. Even though the average duration of the test utterances is less - 4.9s for LT and 2.5s for CT - the systems performed well, offering the following identification accuracies: 87.72% (GMM), 93.97% (CNN), 89.24% (PPR), 94.21% (P-LVCSR), 88.57% (UPR-1), 93.53% (UPR-1 with P-LVCSR), 94.55% (UPR-2), and 95.61% (UPR-2 with P-LVCSR).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13739v1,2024-08
Poor-Supervised Evaluation for SuperLLM via Mutual Consistency,"Peiwen Yuan, Shaoxiong Feng, Yiwei Li, Xinglin Wang, Boyuan Pan, Heda Wang, Yao Hu, Kan Li","The guidance from capability evaluations has greatly propelled the progress of both human society and Artificial Intelligence. However, as LLMs evolve, it becomes challenging to construct evaluation benchmarks for them with accurate labels on hard tasks that approach the boundaries of human capabilities. To credibly conduct evaluation without accurate labels (denoted as poor-supervised evaluation), we propose the PoEM framework. We first prove that the capability of a model can be equivalently assessed by the consistency between it and certain reference model, when their prediction distributions are independent and the sample size is infinite. To alleviate the insufficiencies of the conditions in reality, we further introduce an algorithm that treats humans (when available) and the models under evaluation as reference models, alternately conducting model weights calibration and filtering during E-step and M-step. Comprehensive experiments across 3 types of tasks with 16 mainstream LLMs have shown that PoEM under poor supervision can achieve an average of 0.98 Pearson correlation coefficient with supervised evaluation results, demonstrating good effectiveness, efficiency and generalizability. More generally, PoEM has advanced the evaluation paradigm evolution from human-centric to human&model-centric by treating both of them as reference models, mitigating the limitations of human evaluation in the era of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13738v1,2024-08
LLMs as Zero-shot Graph Learners: Alignment of GNN Representations with LLM Token Embeddings,"Duo Wang, Yuan Zuo, Fengzhi Li, Junjie Wu","Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14512v3,2024-08
Unveiling the Statistical Foundations of Chain-of-Thought Prompting Methods,"Xinyang Hu, Fengzhuo Zhang, Siyu Chen, Zhuoran Yang","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its variants have gained popularity as effective methods for solving multi-step reasoning problems using pretrained large language models (LLMs). In this work, we analyze CoT prompting from a statistical estimation perspective, providing a comprehensive characterization of its sample complexity. To this end, we introduce a multi-step latent variable model that encapsulates the reasoning process, where the latent variable encodes the task information. Under this framework, we demonstrate that when the pretraining dataset is sufficiently large, the estimator formed by CoT prompting is equivalent to a Bayesian estimator. This estimator effectively solves the multi-step reasoning problem by aggregating a posterior distribution inferred from the demonstration examples in the prompt. Moreover, we prove that the statistical error of the CoT estimator can be decomposed into two main components: (i) a prompting error, which arises from inferring the true task using CoT prompts, and (ii) the statistical error of the pretrained LLM. We establish that, under appropriate assumptions, the prompting error decays exponentially to zero as the number of demonstrations increases. Additionally, we explicitly characterize the approximation and generalization errors of the pretrained LLM. Notably, we construct a transformer model that approximates the target distribution of the multi-step reasoning problem with an error that decreases exponentially in the number of transformer blocks. Our analysis extends to other variants of CoT, including Self-Consistent CoT, Tree-of-Thought, and Selection-Inference, offering a broad perspective on the efficacy of these methods. We also provide numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14511v2,2024-08
DHP Benchmark: Are LLMs Good NLG Evaluators?,"Yicheng Wang, Jiayi Yuan, Yu-Neng Chuang, Zhuoer Wang, Yingchi Liu, Mark Cusick, Param Kulkarni, Zhengping Ji, Yasser Ibrahim, Xia Hu","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as evaluators in Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in scoring NLG quality remain inadequately explored. Current studies depend on human assessments and simple metrics that fail to capture the discernment of LLMs across diverse NLG tasks. To address this gap, we propose the Discernment of Hierarchical Perturbation (DHP) benchmarking framework, which provides quantitative discernment scores for LLMs utilizing hierarchically perturbed text data and statistical tests to measure the NLG evaluation capabilities of LLMs systematically. We have re-established six evaluation datasets for this benchmark, covering four NLG tasks: Summarization, Story Completion, Question Answering, and Translation. Our comprehensive benchmarking of five major LLM series provides critical insight into their strengths and limitations as NLG evaluators.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13704v1,2024-08
Path-Consistency: Prefix Enhancement for Efficient Inference in LLM,"Jiace Zhu, Yingtao Shen, Jie Zhao, An Zou","To enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), self-consistency has gained significant popularity by combining multiple sampling with majority voting. However, the state-of-the-art self-consistency approaches consume substantial computational resources and lead to significant additional time costs due to the multiple sampling. This prevents its full potential from being realized in scenarios where computational resources are critical. To improve the inference efficiency, this paper introduces \textit{path-consistency}, a method that leverages the confidence of answers generated in earlier branches to identify the prefix of the most promising path. By dynamically guiding the generation of subsequent branches based on this prefix, the \textit{path-consistency} mitigates both the errors and redundancies from random or less useful sampling in self-consistency. As a result, it can significantly accelerate the inference process by reducing the number of tokens generated. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the \textit{path-consistency} achieves significant acceleration in inference latency ranging from $7.8\%$ to $40.5\%$, while maintaining or even improving task accuracy across different datasets, including mathematical reasoning, common sense reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and code generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01281v1,2024-08
A layer-wise analysis of Mandarin and English suprasegmentals in SSL speech models,"Antón de la Fuente, Dan Jurafsky","This study asks how self-supervised speech models represent suprasegmental categories like Mandarin lexical tone, English lexical stress, and English phrasal accents. Through a series of probing tasks, we make layer-wise comparisons of English and Mandarin 12 layer monolingual models. Our findings suggest that 1) English and Mandarin wav2vec 2.0 models learn contextual representations of abstract suprasegmental categories which are strongest in the middle third of the network. 2) Models are better at representing features that exist in the language of their training data, and this difference is driven by enriched context in transformer blocks, not local acoustic representation. 3) Fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 improves performance in later layers compared to pre-trained models mainly for lexically contrastive features like tone and stress, 4) HuBERT and WavLM learn similar representations to wav2vec 2.0, differing mainly in later layer performance. Our results extend previous understanding of how models represent suprasegmentals and offer new insights into the language-specificity and contextual nature of these representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13678v1,2024-08
"Towards Human-Level Understanding of Complex Process Engineering Schematics: A Pedagogical, Introspective Multi-Agent Framework for Open-Domain Question Answering","Sagar Srinivas Sakhinana, Geethan Sannidhi, Venkataramana Runkana","In the chemical and process industries, Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) are critical for design, construction, and maintenance. Recent advancements in Generative AI, such as Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) like GPT4 (Omni), have shown promise in understanding and interpreting process diagrams for Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, proprietary models pose data privacy risks, and their computational complexity prevents knowledge editing for domain-specific customization on consumer hardware. To overcome these challenges, we propose a secure, on-premises enterprise solution using a hierarchical, multi-agent Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for open-domain question answering (ODQA) tasks, offering enhanced data privacy, explainability, and cost-effectiveness. Our novel multi-agent framework employs introspective and specialized sub-agents using open-source, small-scale multimodal models with the ReAct (Reason+Act) prompting technique for PFD and P&ID analysis, integrating multiple information sources to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers. Our approach, supported by iterative self-correction, aims to deliver superior performance in ODQA tasks. We conducted rigorous experimental studies, and the empirical results validated the proposed approach effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00082v1,2024-08
Localize-and-Stitch: Efficient Model Merging via Sparse Task Arithmetic,"Yifei He, Yuzheng Hu, Yong Lin, Tong Zhang, Han Zhao","Model merging offers an effective strategy to combine the strengths of multiple finetuned models into a unified model that preserves the specialized capabilities of each. Existing methods merge models in a global manner, performing arithmetic operations across all model parameters. However, such global merging often leads to task interference, degrading the performance of the merged model. In this work, we introduce Localize-and-Stitch, a novel approach that merges models in a localized way. Our algorithm works in two steps: i) Localization: identify tiny ($1\%$ of the total parameters) localized regions in the finetuned models containing essential skills for the downstream tasks, and ii) Stitching: reintegrate only these essential regions back into the pretrained model for task synergy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively locates sparse regions responsible for finetuned performance, and the localized regions could be treated as compact and interpretable representations of the finetuned models (tasks). Empirically, we evaluate our method on various vision and language benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing model merging methods under different data availability scenarios. Beyond strong empirical performance, our algorithm also facilitates model compression and preserves pretrained knowledge, enabling flexible and continual skill composition from multiple finetuned models with minimal storage and computational overhead.

Symbolic Working Memory Enhances Language Models for Complex Rule Application,"Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Yejin Choi, Xiang Ren","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning performance but struggle with multi-step deductive reasoning involving a series of rule application steps, especially when rules are presented non-sequentially. Our preliminary analysis shows that while LLMs excel in single-step rule application, their performance drops significantly in multi-step scenarios due to the challenge in rule grounding. It requires anchoring the applicable rule and supporting facts at each step, amidst multiple input rules, facts, and inferred facts. To address this, we propose augmenting LLMs with external working memory and introduce a neurosymbolic framework for rule application. The memory stores facts and rules in both natural language and symbolic forms, enabling precise tracking. Utilizing this memory, our framework iteratively performs symbolic rule grounding and LLM-based rule implementation. The former matches predicates and variables of symbolic rules and facts to ground applicable rules at each step. Experiments indicate our framework's effectiveness in rule application and its robustness across various steps and settings~\footnote{Code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/SiyuanWangw/RuleApplication}.}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13654v1,2024-08

We find that disinformation campaigns consistently and intentionally favor specific framing, depending on the target language of the audience.

Ancient but Digitized: Developing Handwritten Optical Character Recognition for East Syriac Script Through Creating KHAMIS Dataset,"Ameer Majeed, Hossein Hassani","Many languages have vast amounts of handwritten texts, such as ancient scripts about folktale stories and historical narratives or contemporary documents and letters. Digitization of those texts has various applications, such as daily tasks, cultural studies, and historical research. Syriac is an ancient, endangered, and low-resourced language that has not received the attention it requires and deserves. This paper reports on a research project aimed at developing a optical character recognition (OCR) model based on the handwritten Syriac texts as a starting point to build more digital services for this endangered language. A dataset was created, KHAMIS (inspired by the East Syriac poet, Khamis bar Qardahe), which consists of handwritten sentences in the East Syriac script. We used it to fine-tune the Tesseract-OCR engine's pretrained Syriac model on handwritten data. The data was collected from volunteers capable of reading and writing in the language to create KHAMIS. KHAMIS currently consists of 624 handwritten Syriac sentences collected from 31 university students and one professor, and it will be partially available online and the whole dataset available in the near future for development and research purposes. As a result, the handwritten OCR model was able to achieve a character error rate of 1.097-1.610% and 8.963-10.490% on both training and evaluation sets, respectively, and both a character error rate of 18.89-19.71% and a word error rate of 62.83-65.42% when evaluated on the test set, which is twice as better than the default Syriac model of Tesseract.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13631v1,2024-08
No Dataset Needed for Downstream Knowledge Benchmarking: Response Dispersion Inversely Correlates with Accuracy on Domain-specific QA,Robert L Simione II,"This research seeks to obviate the need for creating QA datasets and grading (chatbot) LLM responses when comparing LLMs' knowledge in specific topic domains. This is done in an entirely end-user centric way without need for access to any inner workings of the LLM, so long as it can be prompted and given a random seed to create different generations to the same prompt. The paper does this by, for a given topic domain, defining the ""response dispersion"" of an LLM by repeatedly asking an LLM the same opinion question about that topic domain. Namely, the response dispersion is the count of singular values needed to explain 95% of the variance in the embedding matrix of the LLM's responses. It is found that the response dispersion is inversely correlated with accuracy on relevant QA evaluations (average spearman rank correlation stronger than -.59). A use-case analysis shows that when comparing two different LLMs on the same topic domain, comparing their response dispersion is a suitable replacement for comparing their QA accuracy between 74% and 89% of the time, the range depending on certain reasonable accuracy-difference tolerances that may be acceptable to an end-user in exchange for the labor being saved using response dispersion instead of QA accuracy for comparison. Two response embeddings are studied for creating the embedding matrix in this study, one is from OpenAI's APIs and one is a novel embedding, here named reference sentence similarity embeddings, that can be computed locally and performs very nearly as well in calculating response dispersion. Also in this research, a pre-existing dataset called the IRC-Wiki Trivia dataset, originally developed for trivia games, has been re-purposed, curated, and the curation, called IRC-WikiTriviaQA, is made available for the purpose of this research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13624v1,2024-08

SpeechCraft: A Fine-grained Expressive Speech Dataset with Natural Language Description,"Zeyu Jin, Jia Jia, Qixin Wang, Kehan Li, Shuoyi Zhou, Songtao Zhou, Xiaoyu Qin, Zhiyong Wu","Speech-language multi-modal learning presents a significant challenge due to the fine nuanced information inherent in speech styles. Therefore, a large-scale dataset providing elaborate comprehension of speech style is urgently needed to facilitate insightful interplay between speech audio and natural language. However, constructing such datasets presents a major trade-off between large-scale data collection and high-quality annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic speech annotation system for expressiveness interpretation that annotates in-the-wild speech clips with expressive and vivid human language descriptions. Initially, speech audios are processed by a series of expert classifiers and captioning models to capture diverse speech characteristics, followed by a fine-tuned LLaMA for customized annotation generation. Unlike previous tag/templet-based annotation frameworks with limited information and diversity, our system provides in-depth understandings of speech style through tailored natural language descriptions, thereby enabling accurate and voluminous data generation for large model training. With this system, we create SpeechCraft, a fine-grained bilingual expressive speech dataset. It is distinguished by highly descriptive natural language style prompts, containing approximately 2,000 hours of audio data and encompassing over two million speech clips. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dataset significantly boosts speech-language task performance in stylist speech synthesis and speech style understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13608v1,2024-08
Balancing Diversity and Risk in LLM Sampling: How to Select Your Method and Parameter for Open-Ended Text Generation,"Yuxuan Zhou, Margret Keuper, Mario Fritz","Sampling-based decoding strategies have been widely adopted for Large Language Models (LLMs) in numerous applications, targeting a balance between diversity and quality via temperature tuning and tail truncation. Considering the strong dependency of the candidate next tokens on different prefixes, recent studies propose to adaptively truncate the tail of LLMs' predicted distribution. Although improved results have been reported with these methods on open-ended text generation tasks, the results are highly dependent on the curated parameters and the limited exemplar text. In this paper, we propose a systematic way to estimate the capacity of a truncation sampling method by considering the trade-off between diversity and risk at each decoding step, based on our collected prefix tree which preserves the context of a full sentence. Our work offers a comprehensive comparison of existing truncation sampling methods and serves as a practical user guideline for their parameter selection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13586v2,2024-08
FLEURS-ASL: Including American Sign Language in Massively Multilingual Multitask Evaluation,Garrett Tanzer,"Sign language translation has historically been peripheral to mainstream machine translation research.

FLEURS-ASL can be used to evaluate a variety of tasks -- primarily sentence- and discourse-level translation -- between ASL and 200 other languages as text, or 102 languages as speech. We provide baselines for tasks from ASL to English text using a unified modeling approach that incorporates timestamp tokens and previous text tokens in a 34-second context window, trained on random video clips from YouTube-ASL.

IQA-EVAL: Automatic Evaluation of Human-Model Interactive Question Answering,"Ruosen Li, Ruochen Li, Barry Wang, Xinya Du","To evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA), traditional methods typically focus on assessing single-turn responses to given questions. However, this approach doesn't capture the dynamic nature of human-AI interactions, where humans actively seek information through conversation. Recent works in human-computer interaction (HCI) have employed human evaluators to conduct interactions and evaluations, but they are often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to scale. We introduce an automatic evaluation framework IQA-EVAL to achieve Interactive Question Answering Evaluations, more specifically, we introduce a LLM-based Evaluation Agent (LEA) that can: (1) simulate human behaviors to generate interactions with IQA models; (2) automatically evaluate the generated interactions. Moreover, we propose assigning personas to LEAs to better simulate groups of real human evaluators. We show that: (1) our evaluation framework with GPT-4 (or Claude) as the backbone model achieves a high correlation with human evaluations on the IQA task; (2) assigning personas to LEA to better represent the crowd further significantly improves correlations. Finally, we use our automatic metric to evaluate five recent representative LLMs with over 1000 questions from complex and ambiguous question answering tasks, which comes with a substantial cost of $5k if evaluated by humans.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13545v2,2024-08
Are LLM-based methods good enough for detecting unfair terms of service?,"Mirgita Frasheri, Arian Bakhtiarnia, Lukas Esterle, Alexandros Iosifidis","Countless terms of service (ToS) are being signed everyday by users all over the world while interacting with all kinds of apps and websites. More often than not, these online contracts spanning double-digit pages are signed blindly by users who simply want immediate access to the desired service. What would normally require a consultation with a legal team, has now become a mundane activity consisting of a few clicks where users potentially sign away their rights, for instance in terms of their data privacy, to countless online entities/companies. Large language models (LLMs) are good at parsing long text-based documents, and could potentially be adopted to help users when dealing with dubious clauses in ToS and their underlying privacy policies. To investigate the utility of existing models for this task, we first build a dataset consisting of 12 questions applied individually to a set of privacy policies crawled from popular websites. Thereafter, a series of open-source as well as commercial chatbots such as ChatGPT, are queried over each question, with the answers being compared to a given ground truth. Our results show that some open-source models are able to provide a higher accuracy compared to some commercial models. However, the best performance is recorded from a commercial chatbot (ChatGPT4). Overall, all models perform only slightly better than random at this task. Consequently, their performance needs to be significantly improved before they can be adopted at large for this purpose.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00077v2,2024-08

Pandora's Box or Aladdin's Lamp: A Comprehensive Analysis Revealing the Role of RAG Noise in Large Language Models,"Jinyang Wu, Feihu Che, Chuyuan Zhang, Jianhua Tao, Shuai Zhang, Pengpeng Shao","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial method for addressing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). While recent research has extended RAG models to complex noisy scenarios, these explorations often confine themselves to limited noise types and presuppose that noise is inherently detrimental to LLMs, potentially deviating from real-world retrieval environments and restricting practical applicability. In this paper, we define seven distinct noise types from a linguistic perspective and establish a Noise RAG Benchmark (NoiserBench), a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing multiple datasets and reasoning tasks. Through empirical evaluation of eight representative LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, we reveal that these noises can be further categorized into two practical groups: noise that is beneficial to LLMs (aka beneficial noise) and noise that is harmful to LLMs (aka harmful noise). While harmful noise generally impairs performance, beneficial noise may enhance several aspects of model capabilities and overall performance. Our analysis offers insights for developing more robust, adaptable RAG solutions and mitigating hallucinations across diverse retrieval scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13533v1,2024-08
HRGraph: Leveraging LLMs for HR Data Knowledge Graphs with Information Propagation-based Job Recommendation,Azmine Toushik Wasi,"Knowledge Graphs (KGs) serving as semantic networks, prove highly effective in managing complex interconnected data in different domains, by offering a unified, contextualized, and structured representation with flexibility that allows for easy adaptation to evolving knowledge.

Selective Preference Optimization via Token-Level Reward Function Estimation,"Kailai Yang, Zhiwei Liu, Qianqian Xie, Jimin Huang, Erxue Min, Sophia Ananiadou","Recent advancements in large language model alignment leverage token-level supervisions to perform fine-grained preference optimization. However, existing token-level alignment methods either optimize on all available tokens, which can be noisy and inefficient, or perform selective training with complex and expensive key token selection strategies. In this work, we propose Selective Preference Optimization (SePO), a novel selective alignment strategy that centers on efficient key token selection. SePO proposes the first token selection method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which trains an oracle model to estimate a token-level reward function on the target data. This method applies to any existing alignment datasets with response-level annotations and enables cost-efficient token selection with small-scale oracle models and training data. The estimated reward function is then utilized to score all tokens within the target dataset, where only the key tokens are selected to supervise the target policy model with a reference model-free contrastive objective function. Extensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks show that SePO significantly outperforms competitive baseline methods by only optimizing 30% key tokens on the target dataset. SePO applications on weak-to-strong generalization show that weak oracle models effectively supervise strong policy models with up to 16.8x more parameters. SePO also effectively selects key tokens from out-of-distribution data to enhance strong policy models and alleviate the over-optimization problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13518v1,2024-08
Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Physics-Aware Reprogramming,"Hao Wang, Jindong Han, Wei Fan, Hao Liu","Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14505v2,2024-08
Utilizing Large Language Models for Named Entity Recognition in Traditional Chinese Medicine against COVID-19 Literature: Comparative Study,"Xu Tong, Nina Smirnova, Sharmila Upadhyaya, Ran Yu, Jack H. Culbert, Chao Sun, Wolfgang Otto, Philipp Mayr","Objective: To explore and compare the performance of ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art LLMs on domain-specific NER tasks covering different entity types and domains in TCM against COVID-19 literature. Methods: We established a dataset of 389 articles on TCM against COVID-19, and manually annotated 48 of them with 6 types of entities belonging to 3 domains as the ground truth, against which the NER performance of LLMs can be assessed. We then performed NER tasks for the 6 entity types using ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and 4 state-of-the-art BERT-based question-answering (QA) models (RoBERTa, MiniLM, PubMedBERT and SciBERT) without prior training on the specific task. A domain fine-tuned model (GSAP-NER) was also applied for a comprehensive comparison. Results: The overall performance of LLMs varied significantly in exact match and fuzzy match. In the fuzzy match, ChatGPT surpassed BERT-based QA models in 5 out of 6 tasks, while in exact match, BERT-based QA models outperformed ChatGPT in 5 out of 6 tasks but with a smaller F-1 difference. GPT-4 showed a significant advantage over other models in fuzzy match, especially on the entity type of TCM formula and the Chinese patent drug (TFD) and ingredient (IG). Although GPT-4 outperformed BERT-based models on entity type of herb, target, and research method, none of the F-1 scores exceeded 0.5. GSAP-NER, outperformed GPT-4 in terms of F-1 by a slight margin on RM. ChatGPT achieved considerably higher recalls than precisions, particularly in the fuzzy match. Conclusions: The NER performance of LLMs is highly dependent on the entity type, and their performance varies across application scenarios. ChatGPT could be a good choice for scenarios where high recall is favored. However, for knowledge acquisition in rigorous scenarios, neither ChatGPT nor BERT-based QA models are off-the-shelf tools for professional practitioners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13501v1,2024-08
Why Antiwork: A RoBERTa-Based System for Work-Related Stress Identification and Leading Factor Analysis,"Tao Lu, Muzhe Wu, Xinyi Lu, Siyuan Xu, Shuyu Zhan, Anuj Tambwekar, Emily Mower Provost","Harsh working environments and work-related stress have been known to contribute to mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. As such, it is paramount to create solutions that can both detect employee unhappiness and find the root cause of the problem. While prior works have examined causes of mental health using machine learning, they typically focus on general mental health analysis, with few of them focusing on explainable solutions or looking at the workplace-specific setting. r/antiwork is a subreddit for the antiwork movement, which is the desire to stop working altogether. Using this subreddit as a proxy for work environment dissatisfaction, we create a new dataset for antiwork sentiment detection and subsequently train a model that highlights the words with antiwork sentiments. Following this, we performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis to uncover some of the key insights into the mindset of individuals who identify with the antiwork movement and how their working environments influenced them. We find that working environments that do not give employees authority or responsibility, frustrating recruiting experiences, and unfair compensation, are some of the leading causes of the antiwork sentiment, resulting in a lack of self-confidence and motivation among their employees.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13473v1,2024-08
Uncovering Biases with Reflective Large Language Models,Edward Y. Chang,"Biases and errors in human-labeled data present significant challenges for machine learning, especially in supervised learning reliant on potentially flawed ground truth data. These flaws, including diagnostic errors and societal biases, risk being propagated and amplified through models trained using maximum likelihood estimation. We present the Reflective LLM Dialogue Framework RLDF, which leverages structured adversarial dialogues between multiple instances of a single LLM or different LLMs to uncover diverse perspectives and correct inconsistencies. By conditioning LLMs to adopt opposing stances, RLDF enables systematic bias detection through conditional statistics, information theory, and divergence metrics. Experiments show RLDF successfully identifies potential biases in public content while exposing limitations in human-labeled data. Our framework supports measurable progress tracking and explainable remediation actions, offering a scalable approach for improving content neutrality through transparent, multi-perspective analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13464v2,2024-08
Make Every Penny Count: Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency for Cost-Efficient Reasoning,"Xinglin Wang, Shaoxiong Feng, Yiwei Li, Peiwen Yuan, Yueqi Zhang, Boyuan Pan, Heda Wang, Yao Hu, Kan Li","Self-consistency (SC), a widely used decoding strategy for chain-of-thought reasoning, shows significant gains across various multi-step reasoning tasks but comes with a high cost due to multiple sampling with the preset size. Its variants, Adaptive self-consistency (ASC) and Early-stopping self-consistency (ESC), dynamically adjust the number of samples based on the posterior distribution of a set of pre-samples, reducing the cost of SC with minimal impact on performance. Both methods, however, do not exploit the prior information about question difficulty. It often results in unnecessary repeated sampling for easy questions that could be accurately answered with just one attempt, wasting resources. To tackle this problem, we propose Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC), which leverages the difficulty information from both prior and posterior perspectives to adaptively allocate inference resources, further reducing the cost of SC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DSC, we conduct extensive experiments on three popular categories of reasoning tasks: arithmetic, commonsense and symbolic reasoning on six benchmarks. The empirical results show that DSC consistently surpasses the strong baseline ASC and ESC in terms of costs by a significant margin, while attaining comparable performances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13457v1,2024-08
A Law of Next-Token Prediction in Large Language Models,"Hangfeng He, Weijie J. Su","Large language models (LLMs) have been widely employed across various application domains, yet their black-box nature poses significant challenges to understanding how these models process input data internally to make predictions. In this paper, we introduce a precise and quantitative law that governs the learning of contextualized token embeddings through intermediate layers in pre-trained LLMs for next-token prediction. Our findings reveal that each layer contributes equally to enhancing prediction accuracy, from the lowest to the highest layer -- a universal phenomenon observed across a diverse array of open-source LLMs, built on architectures such as Transformer, RWKV, and Mamba. We demonstrate that this law offers new perspectives and insights to inform and guide practices in LLM development and applications, including model scaling, pre-training tasks, and information flow. Overall, our law enables more fine-grained approaches to the design, training, and interpretation of LLMs through scrutinizing their internal data processing mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13442v1,2024-08
Knowledge-Aware Conversation Derailment Forecasting Using Graph Convolutional Networks,"Enas Altarawneh, Ameeta Agrawal, Michael Jenkin, Manos Papagelis","Online conversations are particularly susceptible to derailment, which can manifest itself in the form of toxic communication patterns including disrespectful comments and abuse. Forecasting conversation derailment predicts signs of derailment in advance enabling proactive moderation of conversations. State-of-the-art approaches to conversation derailment forecasting sequentially encode conversations and use graph neural networks to model dialogue user dynamics. However, existing graph models are not able to capture complex conversational characteristics such as context propagation and emotional shifts. The use of common sense knowledge enables a model to capture such characteristics, thus improving performance. Following this approach, here we derive commonsense statements from a knowledge base of dialogue contextual information to enrich a graph neural network classification architecture. We fuse the multi-source information on utterance into capsules, which are used by a transformer-based forecaster to predict conversation derailment. Our model captures conversation dynamics and context propagation, outperforming the state-of-the-art models on the CGA and CMV benchmark datasets",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13440v2,2024-08
Integrating Multi-Head Convolutional Encoders with Cross-Attention for Improved SPARQL Query Translation,"Yi-Hui Chen, Eric Jui-Lin Lu, Kwan-Ho Cheng","The main task of the KGQA system (Knowledge Graph Question Answering) is to convert user input questions into query syntax (such as SPARQL). With the rise of modern popular encoders and decoders like Transformer and ConvS2S, many scholars have shifted the research direction of SPARQL generation to the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) architecture or the generative AI field of Text-to-SPARQL. In NMT-based QA systems, the system treats knowledge base query syntax as a language. It uses NMT-based translation models to translate natural language questions into query syntax. Scholars use popular architectures equipped with cross-attention, such as Transformer, ConvS2S, and BiLSTM, to train translation models for query syntax. To achieve better query results, this paper improved the ConvS2S encoder and added multi-head attention from the Transformer, proposing a Multi-Head Conv encoder (MHC encoder) based on the n-gram language model. The principle is to use convolutional layers to capture local hidden features in the input sequence with different receptive fields, using multi-head attention to calculate dependencies between them. Ultimately, we found that the translation model based on the Multi-Head Conv encoder achieved better performance than other encoders, obtaining 76.52\% and 83.37\% BLEU-1 (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) on the QALD-9 and LC-QuAD-1.0 datasets, respectively. Additionally, in the end-to-end system experiments on the QALD-9 and LC-QuAD-1.0 datasets, we achieved leading results over other KGQA systems, with Macro F1-measures reaching 52\% and 66\%, respectively. Moreover, the experimental results show that with limited computational resources, if one possesses an excellent encoder-decoder architecture and cross-attention, experts and scholars can achieve outstanding performance equivalent to large pre-trained models using only general embeddings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13432v1,2024-08
Generative-Adversarial Networks for Low-Resource Language Data Augmentation in Machine Translation,Linda Zeng,"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems struggle when translating to and from low-resource languages, which lack large-scale data corpora for models to use for training. As manual data curation is expensive and time-consuming, we propose utilizing a generative-adversarial network (GAN) to augment low-resource language data. When training on a very small amount of language data (under 20,000 sentences) in a simulated low-resource setting, our model shows potential at data augmentation, generating monolingual language data with sentences such as ""ask me that healthy lunch im cooking up,"" and ""my grandfather work harder than your grandfather before."" Our novel data augmentation approach takes the first step in investigating the capability of GANs in low-resource NMT, and our results suggest that there is promise for future extension of GANs to low-resource NMT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00071v1,2024-08
DrugAgent: Explainable Drug Repurposing Agent with Large Language Model-based Reasoning,"Yoshitaka Inoue, Tianci Song, Tianfan Fu","Drug repurposing offers a promising avenue for accelerating drug development by identifying new therapeutic potentials of existing drugs. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework to enhance the drug repurposing process using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and knowledge integration. Our framework comprises several specialized agents: an AI Agent trains robust drug-target interaction (DTI) models; a Knowledge Graph Agent utilizes the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb), DrugBank, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) to systematically extract DTIs; and a Search Agent interacts with biomedical literature to annotate and verify computational predictions. By integrating outputs from these agents, our system effectively harnesses diverse data sources, including external databases, to propose viable repurposing candidates. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our approach in not only predicting drug-disease interactions but also in reducing the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery methods. This paper highlights the scalability of multi-agent systems in biomedical research and their role in driving innovation in drug repurposing. Our approach not only outperforms existing methods in predicting drug repurposing potential but also provides interpretable results, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective drug discovery processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13378v3,2024-08
Learning to Plan Long-Term for Language Modeling,"Florian Mai, Nathan Cornille, Marie-Francine Moens","Modern language models predict the next token in the sequence by considering the past text through a powerful function such as attention. However, language models have no explicit mechanism that allows them to spend computation time for planning long-distance future text, leading to a suboptimal token prediction. In this paper, we propose a planner that predicts a latent plan for many sentences into the future. By sampling multiple plans at once, we condition the language model on an accurate approximation of the distribution of text continuations, which leads to better next token prediction accuracy. In effect, this allows trading computation time for prediction accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00070v1,2024-08

Our multi-step approach first extracts and summarizes key text chunks from papers, analyzes their code relevance, and creates a knowledge graph using a predefined ontology. Code is then generated from this structured representation and enhanced through a proposed retrospective retrieval-augmented generation approach. CodeRefine addresses the challenge of bridging theoretical research and practical implementation, offering a more accurate alternative to LLM zero-shot prompting.

Power Scheduler: A Batch Size and Token Number Agnostic Learning Rate Scheduler,"Yikang Shen, Matthew Stallone, Mayank Mishra, Gaoyuan Zhang, Shawn Tan, Aditya Prasad, Adriana Meza Soria, David D. Cox, Rameswar Panda","Finding the optimal learning rate for language model pretraining is a challenging task. This is not only because there is a complicated correlation between learning rate, batch size, number of training tokens, model size, and other hyperparameters but also because it is prohibitively expensive to perform a hyperparameter search for large language models with Billions or Trillions of parameters. Recent studies propose using small proxy models and small corpus to perform hyperparameter searches and transposing the optimal parameters to large models and large corpus. While the zero-shot transferability is theoretically and empirically proven for model size related hyperparameters, like depth and width, the zero-shot transfer from small corpus to large corpus is underexplored. In this paper, we study the correlation between optimal learning rate, batch size, and number of training tokens for the recently proposed WSD scheduler. After thousands of small experiments, we found a power-law relationship between variables and demonstrated its transferability across model sizes. Based on the observation, we propose a new learning rate scheduler, Power scheduler, that is agnostic about the number of training tokens and batch size. The experiment shows that combining the Power scheduler with Maximum Update Parameterization (muP) can consistently achieve impressive performance with one set of hyperparameters regardless of the number of training tokens, batch size, model size, and even model architecture. Our 3B dense and MoE models trained with the Power scheduler achieve comparable performance as state-of-the-art small language models.

LalaEval: A Holistic Human Evaluation Framework for Domain-Specific Large Language Models,"Chongyan Sun, Ken Lin, Shiwei Wang, Hulong Wu, Chengfei Fu, Zhen Wang","This paper introduces LalaEval, a holistic framework designed for the human evaluation of domain-specific large language models (LLMs). LalaEval proposes a comprehensive suite of end-to-end protocols that cover five main components including domain specification, criteria establishment, benchmark dataset creation, construction of evaluation rubrics, and thorough analysis and interpretation of evaluation outcomes. This initiative aims to fill a crucial research gap by providing a systematic methodology for conducting standardized human evaluations within specific domains, a practice that, despite its widespread application, lacks substantial coverage in the literature and human evaluation are often criticized to be less reliable due to subjective factors, so standardized procedures adapted to the nuanced requirements of specific domains or even individual organizations are in great need. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the framework's application within the logistics industry, presenting domain-specific evaluation benchmarks, datasets, and a comparative analysis of LLMs for the logistics domain use, highlighting the framework's capacity to elucidate performance differences and guide model selection and development for domain-specific LLMs. Through real-world deployment, the paper underscores the framework's effectiveness in advancing the field of domain-specific LLM evaluation, thereby contributing significantly to the ongoing discussion on LLMs' practical utility and performance in domain-specific applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13338v1,2024-08
Domain-specific long text classification from sparse relevant information,"Célia D'Cruz, Jean-Marc Bereder, Frédéric Precioso, Michel Riveill","Large Language Models have undoubtedly revolutionized the Natural Language Processing field, the current trend being to promote one-model-for-all tasks (sentiment analysis, translation, etc.). However, the statistical mechanisms at work in the larger language models struggle to exploit the relevant information when it is very sparse, when it is a weak signal. This is the case, for example, for the classification of long domain-specific documents, when the relevance relies on a single relevant word or on very few relevant words from technical jargon. In the medical domain, it is essential to determine whether a given report contains critical information about a patient's condition. This critical information is often based on one or few specific isolated terms. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model which exploits a short list of potential target terms to retrieve candidate sentences and represent them into the contextualized embedding of the target term(s) they contain. A pooling of the term(s) embedding(s) entails the document representation to be classified. We evaluate our model on one public medical document benchmark in English and on one private French medical dataset. We show that our narrower hierarchical model is better than larger language models for retrieving relevant long documents in a domain-specific context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13253v1,2024-08
Data Exposure from LLM Apps: An In-depth Investigation of OpenAI's GPTs,"Evin Jaff, Yuhao Wu, Ning Zhang, Umar Iqbal","LLM app ecosystems are quickly maturing and supporting a wide range of use cases, which requires them to collect excessive user data. Given that the LLM apps are developed by third-parties and that anecdotal evidence suggests LLM platforms currently do not strictly enforce their policies, user data shared with arbitrary third-parties poses a significant privacy risk. In this paper we aim to bring transparency in data practices of LLM apps. As a case study, we study OpenAI's GPT app ecosystem. We develop an LLM-based framework to conduct the static analysis of natural language-based source code of GPTs and their Actions (external services) to characterize their data collection practices. Our findings indicate that Actions collect expansive data about users, including sensitive information prohibited by OpenAI, such as passwords. We find that some Actions, including related to advertising and analytics, are embedded in multiple GPTs, which allow them to track user activities across GPTs. Additionally, co-occurrence of Actions exposes as much as 9.5x more data to them, than it is exposed to individual Actions. Lastly, we develop an LLM-based privacy policy analysis framework to automatically check the consistency of data collection by Actions with disclosures in their privacy policies. Our measurements indicate that the disclosures for most of the collected data types are omitted in privacy policies, with only 5.8% of Actions clearly disclosing their data collection practices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13247v1,2024-08
Which Prosodic Features Matter Most for Pragmatics?,"Nigel G. Ward, Divette Marco, Olac Fuentes","We investigate which prosodic features matter most in conveying prosodic functions. We use the problem of predicting human perceptions of pragmatic similarity among utterance pairs to evaluate the utility of prosodic features of different types. We find, for example, that duration-related features are more important than pitch-related features, and that utterance-initial features are more important than utterance-final features. Further, failure analysis indicates that modeling using pitch features only often fails to handle important pragmatic functions, and suggests that several generally-neglected acoustic and prosodic features are pragmatically significant, including nasality and vibrato. These findings can guide future basic research in prosody, and suggest how to improve speech synthesis evaluation, among other applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13240v1,2024-08
Multi-Layer Transformers Gradient Can be Approximated in Almost Linear Time,"Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou","The computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism in popular transformer architectures poses significant challenges for training and inference, and becomes the bottleneck for long inputs. Is it possible to significantly reduce the quadratic time complexity of computing the gradients in multi-layer transformer models? This paper proves that a novel fast approximation method can calculate the gradients in almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the input sequence length, while it maintains a polynomially small approximation error $1 / \mathrm{poly}(n)$ across the entire model. Our theory holds for general loss functions and when the multi-layer transformer model contains many practical sub-modules, such as residual connection, casual mask, and multi-head attention. By improving the efficiency of gradient computation, we hope that this work will facilitate more effective training and deployment of long-context language models based on our theoretical results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13233v2,2024-08
Enhancing Few-Shot Transfer Learning with Optimized Multi-Task Prompt Tuning through Modular Prompt Composition,"Ahmad Pouramini, Hesham Faili","In recent years, multi-task prompt tuning has garnered considerable attention for its inherent modularity and potential to enhance parameter-efficient transfer learning across diverse tasks. This paper aims to analyze and improve the performance of multiple tasks by facilitating the transfer of knowledge between their corresponding prompts in a multi-task setting. Our proposed approach decomposes the prompt for each target task into a combination of shared prompts (source prompts) and a task-specific prompt (private prompt). During training, the source prompts undergo fine-tuning and are integrated with the private prompt to drive the target prompt for each task. We present and compare multiple methods for combining source prompts to construct the target prompt, analyzing the roles of both source and private prompts within each method. We investigate their contributions to task performance and offer flexible, adjustable configurations based on these insights to optimize performance. Our empirical findings clearly showcase improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to the conventional practice of prompt tuning and related works. Notably, our results substantially outperform other methods in the field in few-shot settings, demonstrating superior performance in various tasks across GLUE benchmark, among other tasks. This achievement is attained with a significantly reduced amount of training data, making our method a promising one for few-shot settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13227v1,2024-08
EUR-USD Exchange Rate Forecasting Based on Information Fusion with Large Language Models and Deep Learning Methods,"Hongcheng Ding, Xuanze Zhao, Zixiao Jiang, Shamsul Nahar Abdullah, Deshinta Arrova Dewi","Accurate forecasting of the EUR/USD exchange rate is crucial for investors, businesses, and policymakers. This paper proposes a novel framework, IUS, that integrates unstructured textual data from news and analysis with structured data on exchange rates and financial indicators to enhance exchange rate prediction. The IUS framework employs large language models for sentiment polarity scoring and exchange rate movement classification of texts. These textual features are combined with quantitative features and input into a Causality-Driven Feature Generator. An Optuna-optimized Bi-LSTM model is then used to forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark models, reducing MAE by 10.69% and RMSE by 9.56% compared to the best performing baseline. Results also show the benefits of data fusion, with the combination of unstructured and structured data yielding higher accuracy than structured data alone. Furthermore, feature selection using the top 12 important quantitative features combined with the textual features proves most effective.

Traditional sentiment analysis methods, while useful for determining overall sentiment, often miss the implicit opinions about particular product or service features. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the evolution of ABSA methodologies, from lexicon-based approaches to machine learning and deep learning techniques. We emphasize the recent advancements in Transformer-based models, particularly Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and its variants, which have set new benchmarks in ABSA tasks. We focused on finetuning Llama and Mistral models, building hybrid models using the SetFit framework, and developing our own model by exploiting the strengths of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer-based models for aspect term extraction (ATE) and aspect sentiment classification (ASC). Our hybrid model Instruct - DeBERTa uses SOTA InstructABSA for aspect extraction and DeBERTa-V3-baseabsa-V1 for aspect sentiment classification. We utilize datasets from different domains to evaluate our model's performance. Our experiments indicate that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of sentiment analysis across all experimented domains. As per our findings, our hybrid model Instruct - DeBERTa is the best-performing model for the joint task of ATE and ASC for both SemEval restaurant 2014 and SemEval laptop 2014 datasets separately.

Can LLM be a Good Path Planner based on Prompt Engineering? Mitigating the Hallucination for Path Planning,"Hourui Deng, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou, Chaosheng Feng","Spatial reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is the foundation for embodied intelligence. However, even in simple maze environments, LLMs still encounter challenges in long-term path-planning, primarily influenced by their spatial hallucination and context inconsistency hallucination by long-term reasoning. To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative model, Spatial-to-Relational Transformation and Curriculum Q-Learning (S2RCQL). To address the spatial hallucination of LLMs, we propose the Spatial-to-Relational approach, which transforms spatial prompts into entity relations and paths representing entity relation chains. This approach fully taps the potential of LLMs in terms of sequential thinking. As a result, we design a path-planning algorithm based on Q-learning to mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination, which enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Using the Q-value of state-action as auxiliary information for prompts, we correct the hallucinations of LLMs, thereby guiding LLMs to learn the optimal path. Finally, we propose a reverse curriculum learning technique based on LLMs to further mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination. LLMs can rapidly accumulate successful experiences by reducing task difficulty and leveraging them to tackle more complex tasks. We performed comprehensive experiments based on Baidu's self-developed LLM: ERNIE-Bot 4.0. The results showed that our S2RCQL achieved a 23%--40% improvement in both success and optimality rates compared with advanced prompt engineering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13184v2,2024-08
Lessons in co-creation: the inconvenient truths of inclusive sign language technology development,"Maartje De Meulder, Davy Van Landuyt, Rehana Omardeen","In the era of AI-driven language technologies, there is a growing demand for the participation and leadership of deaf communities in sign language technology development, often framed as co-creation. This paper, developed through collaborative and iterative dialogue between the authors with data from informal participant observations, examines the involvement of the European Union of the Deaf in two EU Horizon 2020 projects, EASIER and SignON. These projects aimed to develop mobile translation applications between signed and spoken languages, bringing together predominantly hearing, non-signing technology experts with predominantly hearing sign language academics and organizations representing deaf end users in large multi-partner consortia. While co-creation is sometimes presented as the best or required way to do research or even as emancipatory, it frequently masks systemic issues of power imbalances and tokenism. Drawing from EUD's experiences of these projects, we highlight several inconvenient truths of co-creation, and propose seven lessons for future initiatives: recognizing deaf partners' invisible labour as work, managing expectations about technologies, cripping co-creation processes, exploring alternative methods to mitigate co-creation fatigue, seeking intersectional feedback, ensuring co-creation is not just virtue signalling, and fostering deaf leadership in AI sign language research. We argue for co-creation as a transformative activity that fundamentally alters the status quo and levels the playing field. This necessitates increasing the number of deaf researchers and enhancing AI literacy among deaf communities. Without these critical transformative actions, co-creation risks merely paying lip service to deaf communities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13171v1,2024-08

It outlines the historical evolution of LLMs from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to their pivotal role in AI. A comparison of fine-tuning methodologies, including supervised, unsupervised, and instruction-based approaches, highlights their applicability to different tasks. The report introduces a structured seven-stage pipeline for fine-tuning LLMs, spanning data preparation, model initialization, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.

Exploring Bias and Prediction Metrics to Characterise the Fairness of Machine Learning for Equity-Centered Public Health Decision-Making: A Narrative Review,"Shaina Raza, Arash Shaban-Nejad, Elham Dolatabadi, Hiroshi Mamiya","Background: The rapid advancement of Machine Learning (ML) represents novel opportunities to enhance public health research, surveillance, and decision-making. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of algorithmic bias, systematic errors in predicted population health outcomes, resulting from the public health application of ML. The objective of this narrative review is to explore the types of bias generated by ML and quantitative metrics to assess these biases.   Methods : We performed search on PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library, Science Direct, and Springer Nature. We used keywords to identify studies describing types of bias and metrics to measure these in the domain of ML and public and population health published in English between 2008 and 2023, inclusive.   Results: A total of 72 articles met the inclusion criteria. Our review identified the commonly described types of bias and quantitative metrics to assess these biases from an equity perspective.   Conclusion : The review will help formalize the evaluation framework for ML on public health from an equity perspective.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13295v2,2024-08
An alternative formulation of attention pooling function in translation,Eddie Conti,"The aim of this paper is to present an alternative formulation of the attention scoring function in translation tasks. Generally speaking, language is deeply structured, and this is reflected in the attention scoring matrix. We exploit this property to define the attention pooling function, taking this aspect into account. In the first chapters, we introduce the attention mechanism in mathematical terms and explain its limitations and alternative formulations. Next, we focus on the experimental session that led to the alternative formulation. Essentially, we guide queries and keys to interact in a specific manner, encoding the distinct roles of attention heads and directing values on where to seek context. In mathematical terms, we can think of this formula as projecting the attention scores matrix, say $H$, onto the space of band matrices with fixed bandwidth. This convex subspace is clearly finite-dimensional and therefore closed. As a consequence, the projection on this space is well-posed and unique. However, at the price of losing the uniqueness of the projection (i.e., the best approximation for $H$), we defined a new space consisting of band matrices plus error sparse matrices. We prove that this is a compact subspace which guarantees the existence of a matrix that best approximates $H$. We conclude the thesis by validating the new formula, namely calculating how well the new formula for attention scores approximates the original one. Additionally, we explore the impact of different parameters such as w (context windows) and num-pos (number of relevant words in a sentence). These analyses provide deeper insights into how languages are processed and translated, revealing nuances in the roles of context and word relevance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00068v1,2024-08
Analysis of child development facts and myths using text mining techniques and classification models,"Mehedi Tajrian, Azizur Rahman, Muhammad Ashad Kabir, Md Rafiqul Islam","The rapid dissemination of misinformation on the internet complicates the decision-making process for individuals seeking reliable information, particularly parents researching child development topics. This misinformation can lead to adverse consequences, such as inappropriate treatment of children based on myths. While previous research has utilized text-mining techniques to predict child abuse cases, there has been a gap in the analysis of child development myths and facts. This study addresses this gap by applying text mining techniques and classification models to distinguish between myths and facts about child development, leveraging newly gathered data from publicly available websites. The research methodology involved several stages. First, text mining techniques were employed to pre-process the data, ensuring enhanced accuracy. Subsequently, the structured data was analysed using six robust Machine Learning (ML) classifiers and one Deep Learning (DL) model, with two feature extraction techniques applied to assess their performance across three different training-testing splits. To ensure the reliability of the results, cross-validation was performed using both k-fold and leave-one-out methods. Among the classification models tested, Logistic Regression (LR) demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving a 90% accuracy with the Bag-of-Words (BoW) feature extraction technique. LR stands out for its exceptional speed and efficiency, maintaining low testing time per statement (0.97 microseconds). These findings suggest that LR, when combined with BoW, is effective in accurately classifying child development information, thus providing a valuable tool for combating misinformation and assisting parents in making informed decisions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13091v1,2024-08
SpeechPrompt: Prompting Speech Language Models for Speech Processing Tasks,"Kai-Wei Chang, Haibin Wu, Yu-Kai Wang, Yuan-Kuei Wu, Hua Shen, Wei-Cheng Tseng, Iu-thing Kang, Shang-Wen Li, Hung-yi Lee","Prompting has become a practical method for utilizing pre-trained language models (LMs). This approach offers several advantages. It allows an LM to adapt to new tasks with minimal training and parameter updates, thus achieving efficiency in both storage and computation. Additionally, prompting modifies only the LM's inputs and harnesses the generative capabilities of language models to address various downstream tasks in a unified manner. This significantly reduces the need for human labor in designing task-specific models. These advantages become even more evident as the number of tasks served by the LM scales up. Motivated by the strengths of prompting, we are the first to explore the potential of prompting speech LMs in the domain of speech processing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in converting speech into discrete units for language modeling. Our pioneer research demonstrates that these quantized speech units are highly versatile within our unified prompting framework. Not only can they serve as class labels, but they also contain rich phonetic information that can be re-synthesized back into speech signals for speech generation tasks. Specifically, we reformulate speech processing tasks into speech-to-unit generation tasks. As a result, we can seamlessly integrate tasks such as speech classification, sequence generation, and speech generation within a single, unified prompting framework. The experiment results show that the prompting method can achieve competitive performance compared to the strong fine-tuning method based on self-supervised learning models with a similar number of trainable parameters. The prompting method also shows promising results in the few-shot setting. Moreover, with the advanced speech LMs coming into the stage, the proposed prompting framework attains great potential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13040v1,2024-08
In-Context Learning with Reinforcement Learning for Incomplete Utterance Rewriting,"Haowei Du, Dongyan Zhao","In-context learning (ICL) of large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention in the community where LLMs make predictions only based on instructions augmented with a few examples. Existing example selection methods for ICL utilize sparse or dense retrievers and derive effective performance. However, these methods do not utilize direct feedback of LLM to train the retriever and the examples selected can not necessarily improve the analogy ability of LLM. To tackle this, we propose our policy-based reinforcement learning framework for example selection (RLS), which consists of a language model (LM) selector and an LLM generator. The LM selector encodes the candidate examples into dense representations and selects the top-k examples into the demonstration for LLM. The outputs of LLM are adopted to compute the reward and policy gradient to optimize the LM selector. We conduct experiments on different datasets and significantly outperform existing example selection methods. Moreover, our approach shows advantages over supervised finetuning (SFT) models in few shot setting. Further experiments show the balance of abundance and the similarity with the test case of examples is important for ICL performance of LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13028v1,2024-08
Systematic Evaluation of LLM-as-a-Judge in LLM Alignment Tasks: Explainable Metrics and Diverse Prompt Templates,"Hui Wei, Shenghua He, Tian Xia, Andy Wong, Jingyang Lin, Mei Han","Alignment approaches such as RLHF and DPO are actively investigated to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Commercial large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been recently employed to evaluate and compare different LLM alignment approaches. These models act as surrogates for human evaluators due to their promising abilities to approximate human preferences with remarkably faster feedback and lower costs. This methodology is referred to as LLM-as-a-judge. However, concerns regarding its reliability have emerged, attributed to LLM judges' biases and inconsistent decision-making. Previous research has sought to develop robust evaluation frameworks for assessing the reliability of LLM judges and their alignment with human preferences. However, the employed evaluation metrics often lack adequate explainability and fail to address the internal inconsistency of LLMs. Additionally, existing studies inadequately explore the impact of various prompt templates when applying LLM-as-a-judge methods, which leads to potentially inconsistent comparisons between different alignment algorithms. In this work, we systematically evaluate LLM judges on alignment tasks (e.g. summarization) by defining evaluation metrics with improved theoretical interpretability and disentangling reliability metrics with LLM internal inconsistency. We develop a framework to evaluate, compare, and visualize the reliability and alignment of LLM judges to provide informative observations that help choose LLM judges for alignment tasks. Our results indicate a significant impact of prompt templates on LLM judge performance, as well as a mediocre alignment level between the tested LLM judges and human evaluators.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13006v1,2024-08
MedDec: A Dataset for Extracting Medical Decisions from Discharge Summaries,"Mohamed Elgaar, Jiali Cheng, Nidhi Vakil, Hadi Amiri, Leo Anthony Celi","Medical decisions directly impact individuals' health and well-being. Extracting decision spans from clinical notes plays a crucial role in understanding medical decision-making processes. In this paper, we develop a new dataset called ""MedDec"", which contains clinical notes of eleven different phenotypes (diseases) annotated by ten types of medical decisions. We introduce the task of medical decision extraction, aiming to jointly extract and classify different types of medical decisions within clinical notes. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, develop a span detection model as a baseline for this task, evaluate recent span detection approaches, and employ a few metrics to measure the complexity of data samples. Our findings shed light on the complexities inherent in clinical decision extraction and enable future work in this area of research.

Internal and External Knowledge Interactive Refinement Framework for Knowledge-Intensive Question Answering,"Haowei Du, Dongyan Zhao","Recent works have attempted to integrate external knowledge into LLMs to address the limitations and potential factual errors in LLM-generated content. However, how to retrieve the correct knowledge from the large amount of external knowledge imposes a challenge. To this end, we empirically observe that LLMs have already encoded rich knowledge in their pretrained parameters and utilizing these internal knowledge improves the retrieval of external knowledge when applying them to knowledge-intensive tasks. In this paper, we propose a new internal and external knowledge interactive refinement paradigm dubbed IEKR to utilize internal knowledge in LLM to help retrieve relevant knowledge from the external knowledge base, as well as exploit the external knowledge to refine the hallucination of generated internal knowledge. By simply adding a prompt like 'Tell me something about' to the LLMs, we try to review related explicit knowledge and insert them with the query into the retriever for external retrieval. The external knowledge is utilized to complement the internal knowledge into input of LLM for answers. We conduct experiments on 3 benchmark datasets in knowledge-intensive question answering task with different LLMs and domains, achieving the new state-of-the-art. Further analysis shows the effectiveness of different modules in our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12979v1,2024-08
Open Llama2 Model for the Lithuanian Language,"Artūras Nakvosas, Povilas Daniušis, Vytas Mulevičius","In this paper, we propose and describe the first open Llama2 large language models (LLMs) for the Lithuanian language, including an accompanying question/answer (Q/A) dataset and translations of popular LLM benchmarks. We provide a brief review of open regional LLMs and detailed information on the proposed LLMs and their training process. We also conduct an empirical evaluation, comparing the perplexities of the proposed LLMs with those of other modern open LLMs. In addition, benchmarking the proposed LLMs against language understanding tasks reveals that high-quality pretraining datasets may be essential for achieving models that perform efficiently on these benchmarks. The full realisations of the described LLMs are available in the accompanying open repository~\url{https://huggingface.co/neurotechnology}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12963v1,2024-08
Multimodal Contrastive In-Context Learning,"Yosuke Miyanishi, Minh Le Nguyen","The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) usage has highlighted the importance of gradient-free in-context learning (ICL). However, interpreting their inner workings remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel multimodal contrastive in-context learning framework to enhance our understanding of ICL in LLMs. First, we present a contrastive learning-based interpretation of ICL in real-world settings, marking the distance of the key-value representation as the differentiator in ICL. Second, we develop an analytical framework to address biases in multimodal input formatting for real-world datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ICL examples where baseline performance is poor, even when they are represented in unseen formats. Lastly, we propose an on-the-fly approach for ICL (Anchored-by-Text ICL) that demonstrates effectiveness in detecting hateful memes, a task where typical ICL struggles due to resource limitations. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets reveal that our approach significantly improves ICL performance across various scenarios, such as challenging tasks and resource-constrained environments. Moreover, it provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of in-context learning in LLMs. Our findings have important implications for developing more interpretable, efficient, and robust multimodal AI systems, especially in challenging tasks and resource-constrained environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12959v1,2024-08
Causal-Guided Active Learning for Debiasing Large Language Models,"Li Du, Zhouhao Sun, Xiao Ding, Yixuan Ma, Yang Zhao, Kaitao Qiu, Ting Liu, Bing Qin","Although achieving promising performance, recent analyses show that current generative large language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them for generation, leading to poor generalizability and harmfulness of LLMs. However, due to the diversity of dataset biases and the over-optimization problem, previous prior-knowledge-based debiasing methods and fine-tuning-based debiasing methods may not be suitable for current LLMs. To address this issue, we explore combining active learning with the causal mechanisms and propose a casual-guided active learning (CAL) framework, which utilizes LLMs itself to automatically and autonomously identify informative biased samples and induce the bias patterns. Then a cost-effective and efficient in-context learning based method is employed to prevent LLMs from utilizing dataset biases during generation. Experimental results show that CAL can effectively recognize typical biased instances and induce various bias patterns for debiasing LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12942v2,2024-08
LCA and energy efficiency in buildings: mapping more than twenty years of research,"F. Asdrubali, A. Fronzetti Colladon, L. Segneri, D. M. Gandola","Research on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is being conducted in various sectors, from analyzing building materials and components to comprehensive evaluations of entire structures. However, reviews of the existing literature have been unable to provide a comprehensive overview of research in this field, leaving scholars without a definitive guideline for future investigations. This paper aims to fill this gap, mapping more than twenty years of research. Using an innovative methodology that combines social network analysis and text mining, the paper examined 8024 scientific abstracts. The authors identified seven key thematic groups, building and sustainability clusters (BSCs). To assess their significance in the broader discourse on building and sustainability, the semantic brand score (SBS) indicator was applied. Additionally, building and sustainability trends were tracked, focusing on the LCA concept. The major research topics mainly relate to building materials and energy efficiency.

IAA: Inner-Adaptor Architecture Empowers Frozen Large Language Model with Multimodal Capabilities,"Bin Wang, Chunyu Xie, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin","In the field of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), common methods typically involve unfreezing the language model during training to foster profound visual understanding. However, the fine-tuning of such models with vision-language data often leads to a diminution of their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. To avoid this performance degradation, a straightforward solution is to freeze the language model while developing multimodal competencies. Unfortunately, previous works have not attained satisfactory outcomes. Building on the strategy of freezing the language model, we conduct thorough structural exploration and introduce the Inner-Adaptor Architecture (IAA). Specifically, the architecture incorporates multiple multimodal adaptors at varying depths within the large language model to facilitate direct interaction with the inherently text-oriented transformer layers, thereby enabling the frozen language model to acquire multimodal capabilities. Unlike previous approaches of freezing language models that require large-scale aligned data, our proposed architecture is able to achieve superior performance on small-scale datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to improve the general multimodal capabilities and visual grounding abilities of the MLLM. Our approach remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across various vision-language benchmarks without sacrificing performance on NLP tasks.

Memory-Efficient LLM Training with Online Subspace Descent,"Kaizhao Liang, Bo Liu, Lizhang Chen, Qiang Liu","Recently, a wide range of memory-efficient LLM training algorithms have gained substantial popularity. These methods leverage the low-rank structure of gradients to project optimizer states into a subspace using projection matrix found by singular value decomposition (SVD). However, convergence of these algorithms is highly dependent on the update rules of their projection matrix. In this work, we provide the \emph{first} convergence guarantee for arbitrary update rules of projection matrix. This guarantee is generally applicable to optimizers that can be analyzed with Hamiltonian Descent, including most common ones, such as LION, Adam. Inspired by our theoretical understanding, we propose Online Subspace Descent, a new family of subspace descent optimizer without SVD. Instead of updating the projection matrix with eigenvectors, Online Subspace Descent updates the projection matrix with online PCA. Online Subspace Descent is flexible and introduces only minimum overhead to training. We show that for the task of pretraining LLaMA models ranging from 60M to 7B parameters on the C4 dataset, Online Subspace Descent achieves lower perplexity and better downstream tasks performance than state-of-the-art low-rank training methods across different settings and narrows the gap with full-rank baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12857v1,2024-08
Multi-Faceted Question Complexity Estimation Targeting Topic Domain-Specificity,"Sujay R, Suki Perumal, Yash Nagraj, Anushka Ghei, Srinivas K S","Question difficulty estimation remains a multifaceted challenge in educational and assessment settings. Traditional approaches often focus on surface-level linguistic features or learner comprehension levels, neglecting the intricate interplay of factors contributing to question complexity. This paper presents a novel framework for domain-specific question difficulty estimation, leveraging a suite of NLP techniques and knowledge graph analysis. We introduce four key parameters: Topic Retrieval Cost, Topic Salience, Topic Coherence, and Topic Superficiality, each capturing a distinct facet of question complexity within a given subject domain. These parameters are operationalized through topic modelling, knowledge graph analysis, and information retrieval techniques. A model trained on these features demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in predicting question difficulty. By operationalizing these parameters, our framework offers a novel approach to question complexity estimation, paving the way for more effective question generation, assessment design, and adaptive learning systems across diverse academic disciplines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12850v1,2024-08
CLLMFS: A Contrastive Learning enhanced Large Language Model Framework for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition,"Yafeng Zhang, Zilan Yu, Yuang Huang, Jing Tang","Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER), the task of identifying named entities with only a limited amount of labeled data, has gained increasing significance in natural language processing. While existing methodologies have shown some effectiveness, such as enriching label semantics through various prompting modes or employing metric learning techniques, their performance exhibits limited robustness across diverse domains due to the lack of rich knowledge in their pre-trained models. To address this issue, we propose CLLMFS, a Contrastive Learning enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) Framework for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition, achieving promising results with limited training data. Considering the impact of LLM's internal representations on downstream tasks, CLLMFS integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning mechanisms specifically tailored for few-shot NER. By enhancing the model's internal representations, CLLMFS effectively improves both entity boundary awareness ability and entity recognition accuracy. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance improvements on F1-score ranging from 2.58\% to 97.74\% over existing best-performing methods across several recognized benchmarks. Furthermore, through cross-domain NER experiments conducted on multiple datasets, we have further validated the robust generalization capability of our method.

LIMP: Large Language Model Enhanced Intent-aware Mobility Prediction,"Songwei Li, Jie Feng, Jiawei Chi, Xinyuan Hu, Xiaomeng Zhao, Fengli Xu","Human mobility prediction is essential for applications like urban planning and transportation management, yet it remains challenging due to the complex, often implicit, intentions behind human behavior. Existing models predominantly focus on spatiotemporal patterns, paying less attention to the underlying intentions that govern movements. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative research angle for integrating commonsense reasoning into mobility prediction. However, it is a non-trivial problem because LLMs are not natively built for mobility intention inference, and they also face scalability issues and integration difficulties with spatiotemporal models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LIMP (LLMs for Intent-ware Mobility Prediction) framework. Specifically, LIMP introduces an ""Analyze-Abstract-Infer"" (A2I) agentic workflow to unleash LLM's commonsense reasoning power for mobility intention inference. Besides, we design an efficient fine-tuning scheme to transfer reasoning power from commercial LLM to smaller-scale, open-source language model, ensuring LIMP's scalability to millions of mobility records. Moreover, we propose a transformer-based intention-aware mobility prediction model to effectively harness the intention inference ability of LLM. Evaluated on two real-world datasets, LIMP significantly outperforms baseline models, demonstrating improved accuracy in next-location prediction and effective intention inference. The interpretability of intention-aware mobility prediction highlights our LIMP framework's potential for real-world applications.

Grounding Fallacies Misrepresenting Scientific Publications in Evidence,"Max Glockner, Yufang Hou, Preslav Nakov, Iryna Gurevych","Health-related misinformation claims often falsely cite a credible biomedical publication as evidence, which superficially appears to support the false claim. The publication does not really support the claim, but a reader could believe it thanks to the use of logical fallacies. Here, we aim to detect and to highlight such fallacies, which requires carefully assessing the exact content of the misrepresented publications. To achieve this, we introduce MissciPlus, an extension of the fallacy detection dataset Missci. MissciPlus builds on Missci by grounding the applied fallacies in real-world passages from misrepresented studies. This creates a realistic test-bed for detecting and verbalizing these fallacies under real-world input conditions, and enables novel passage-retrieval tasks. MissciPlus is the first logical fallacy dataset which pairs the real-world misrepresented evidence with incorrect claims, identical to the input to evidence-based fact-checking models. With MissciPlus, we i) benchmark retrieval models in identifying passages that support claims only when fallacies are applied, ii) evaluate how well LLMs articulate fallacious reasoning from misrepresented scientific passages, and iii) assess the effectiveness of fact-checking models in refuting claims that misrepresent biomedical research. Our findings show that current fact-checking models struggle to use relevant passages from misrepresented publications to refute misinformation. Moreover, these passages can mislead LLMs into accepting false claims as true.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12812v1,2024-08
VALE: A Multimodal Visual and Language Explanation Framework for Image Classifiers using eXplainable AI and Language Models,"Purushothaman Natarajan, Athira Nambiar","Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized various fields by enabling task automation and reducing human error. However, their internal workings and decision-making processes remain obscure due to their black box nature. Consequently, the lack of interpretability limits the application of these models in high-risk scenarios. To address this issue, the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to explain and interpret the inner workings of DNNs. Despite advancements, XAI faces challenges such as the semantic gap between machine and human understanding, the trade-off between interpretability and performance, and the need for context-specific explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal framework named VALE Visual and Language Explanation. VALE integrates explainable AI techniques with advanced language models to provide comprehensive explanations. This framework utilizes visual explanations from XAI tools, an advanced zero-shot image segmentation model, and a visual language model to generate corresponding textual explanations. By combining visual and textual explanations, VALE bridges the semantic gap between machine outputs and human interpretation, delivering results that are more comprehensible to users. In this paper, we conduct a pilot study of the VALE framework for image classification tasks. Specifically, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) are used to identify the most influential regions in classified images. The object of interest is then extracted using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), and explanations are generated using state-of-the-art pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extensive experimental studies are performed on two datasets: the ImageNet dataset and a custom underwater SONAR image dataset, demonstrating VALEs real-world applicability in underwater image classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12808v1,2024-08

Our method enhances preference learning by automatically detecting and removing ambiguous annotations within the dataset. The proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating a marked improvement in performance across various instruction-following tasks.

Quality or Quantity? On Data Scale and Diversity in Adapting Large Language Models for Low-Resource Translation,"Vivek Iyer, Bhavitvya Malik, Pavel Stepachev, Pinzhen Chen, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch","Despite the recent popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Machine Translation (MT), their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs) still lags significantly behind Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. In this work, we explore what it would take to adapt LLMs for the low-resource setting. Particularly, we re-examine the role of two factors: a) the importance and application of parallel data, and b) diversity in Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Recently, parallel data has seen reduced use in adapting LLMs for MT, while data diversity has been embraced to promote transfer across languages and tasks. However, for low-resource LLM-MT, we show that the opposite is true for both considerations: a) parallel data is critical during both pre-training and SFT; b) diversity tends to cause interference instead of transfer. Our experiments with three LLMs across two low-resourced language groups -- Indigenous American and North-East Indian -- reveal consistent trends, underscoring the generalizability of our findings. We believe these insights will be valuable for scaling to massively multilingual LLM-MT models that can effectively serve LRLs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12780v2,2024-08
Investigating LLM Applications in E-Commerce,"Chester Palen-Michel, Ruixiang Wang, Yipeng Zhang, David Yu, Canran Xu, Zhe Wu","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing in various applications especially in e-commerce. One crucial step before the application of such LLMs in these fields is to understand and compare the performance in different use cases in such tasks. This paper explored the efficacy of LLMs in the e-commerce domain, focusing on instruction-tuning an open source LLM model with public e-commerce datasets of varying sizes and comparing the performance with the conventional models prevalent in industrial applications. We conducted a comprehensive comparison between LLMs and traditional pre-trained language models across specific tasks intrinsic to the e-commerce domain, namely classification, generation, summarization, and named entity recognition (NER). Furthermore, we examined the effectiveness of the current niche industrial application of very large LLM, using in-context learning, in e-commerce specific tasks. Our findings indicate that few-shot inference with very large LLMs often does not outperform fine-tuning smaller pre-trained models, underscoring the importance of task-specific model optimization.Additionally, we investigated different training methodologies such as single-task training, mixed-task training, and LoRA merging both within domain/tasks and between different tasks.

Phrasing for UX: Enhancing Information Engagement through Computational Linguistics and Creative Analytics,Nimrod Dvir,"This study explores the relationship between textual features and Information Engagement (IE) on digital platforms. It highlights the impact of computational linguistics and analytics on user interaction. The READ model is introduced to quantify key predictors like representativeness, ease of use, affect, and distribution, which forecast engagement levels. The model's effectiveness is validated through AB testing and randomized trials, showing strong predictive performance in participation (accuracy: 0.94), perception (accuracy: 0.85), perseverance (accuracy: 0.81), and overall IE (accuracy: 0.97).   While participation metrics are strong, perception and perseverance show slightly lower recall and F1-scores, indicating some challenges. The study demonstrates that modifying text based on the READ model's insights leads to significant improvements. For example, increasing representativeness and positive affect boosts selection rates by 11 percent, raises evaluation averages from 3.98 to 4.46, and improves retention rates by 11 percent. These findings highlight the importance of linguistic factors in IE, providing a framework for enhancing digital text engagement.

Assessing Modality Bias in Video Question Answering Benchmarks with Multimodal Large Language Models,"Jean Park, Kuk Jin Jang, Basam Alasaly, Sriharsha Mopidevi, Andrew Zolensky, Eric Eaton, Insup Lee, Kevin Johnson","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can simultaneously process visual, textual, and auditory data, capturing insights that complement human analysis. However, existing video question-answering (VidQA) benchmarks and datasets often exhibit a bias toward a single modality, despite the goal of requiring advanced reasoning skills that integrate diverse modalities to answer the queries. In this work, we introduce the modality importance score (MIS) to identify such bias. It is designed to assess which modality embeds the necessary information to answer the question. Additionally, we propose an innovative method using state-of-the-art MLLMs to estimate the modality importance, which can serve as a proxy for human judgments of modality perception. With this MIS, we demonstrate the presence of unimodal bias and the scarcity of genuinely multimodal questions in existing datasets. We further validate the modality importance score with multiple ablation studies to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on permuted feature sets. Our results indicate that current models do not effectively integrate information due to modality imbalance in existing datasets. Our proposed MLLM-derived MIS can guide the curation of modality-balanced datasets that advance multimodal learning and enhance MLLMs' capabilities to understand and utilize synergistic relations across modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12763v2,2024-08
"SLM Meets LLM: Balancing Latency, Interpretability and Consistency in Hallucination Detection","Mengya Hu, Rui Xu, Deren Lei, Yaxi Li, Mingyu Wang, Emily Ching, Eslam Kamal, Alex Deng","Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable but face latency challenges in real-time applications, such as conducting online hallucination detection. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel framework that leverages a small language model (SLM) classifier for initial detection, followed by a LLM as constrained reasoner to generate detailed explanations for detected hallucinated content. This study optimizes the real-time interpretable hallucination detection by introducing effective prompting techniques that align LLM-generated explanations with SLM decisions. Empirical experiment results demonstrate its effectiveness, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12748v1,2024-08
SQL-GEN: Bridging the Dialect Gap for Text-to-SQL Via Synthetic Data And Model Merging,"Mohammadreza Pourreza, Ruoxi Sun, Hailong Li, Lesly Miculicich, Tomas Pfister, Sercan O. Arik","Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have largely focused on the SQLite dialect, neglecting the diverse landscape of SQL dialects like BigQuery and PostgreSQL. This limitation is due to the diversity in SQL syntaxes and functions, along with the high cost of collecting and curating SQL-specific training data. To address this, we introduce SQL-GEN, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic training data for any SQL dialect, guided by readily available dialect-specific tutorials. SQL-GEN significantly improves cross-dialect Text-to-SQL performance, boosting execution accuracy by up to 20\% over existing methods. This performance gain narrows the gap with models trained on large-scale human-annotated data. Furthermore, combining synthetic data from SQL-GEN with human-annotated data yields additional improvements of up to 5.6\%. To unify multi-dialect capabilities within a single model, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) initialization that leverages the shared knowledge across dialects. Our approach merges self-attention layers from dialect-specific models and initializes expert gates using dialect-specific keywords. This leads to a versatile model optimized for multiple SQL dialects, outperforming single-dialect models and significantly enhancing overall performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12733v2,2024-08

Towards Estimating Personal Values in Song Lyrics,"Andrew M. Demetriou, Jaehun Kim, Sandy Manolios, Cynthia C. S. Liem","Most music widely consumed in Western Countries contains song lyrics, with U.S. samples reporting almost all of their song libraries contain lyrics. In parallel, social science theory suggests that personal values - the abstract goals that guide our decisions and behaviors - play an important role in communication: we share what is important to us to coordinate efforts, solve problems and meet challenges. Thus, the values communicated in song lyrics may be similar or different to those of the listener, and by extension affect the listener's reaction to the song. This suggests that working towards automated estimation of values in lyrics may assist in downstream MIR tasks, in particular, personalization. However, as highly subjective text, song lyrics present a challenge in terms of sampling songs to be annotated, annotation methods, and in choosing a method for aggregation. In this project, we take a perspectivist approach, guided by social science theory, to gathering annotations, estimating their quality, and aggregating them. We then compare aggregated ratings to estimates based on pre-trained sentence/word embedding models by employing a validated value dictionary. We discuss conceptually 'fuzzy' solutions to sampling and annotation challenges, promising initial results in annotation quality and in automated estimations, and future directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12694v1,2024-08
Urban Mobility Assessment Using LLMs,"Prabin Bhandari, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Dieter Pfoser","Understanding urban mobility patterns and analyzing how people move around cities helps improve the overall quality of life and supports the development of more livable, efficient, and sustainable urban areas. A challenging aspect of this work is the collection of mobility data by means of user tracking or travel surveys, given the associated privacy concerns, noncompliance, and high cost. This work proposes an innovative AI-based approach for synthesizing travel surveys by prompting large language models (LLMs), aiming to leverage their vast amount of relevant background knowledge and text generation capabilities. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of this approach across various U.S. metropolitan areas by comparing the results against existing survey data at different granularity levels. These levels include (i) pattern level, which compares aggregated metrics like the average number of locations traveled and travel time, (ii) trip level, which focuses on comparing trips as whole units using transition probabilities, and (iii) activity chain level, which examines the sequence of locations visited by individuals. Our work covers several proprietary and open-source LLMs, revealing that open-source base models like Llama-2, when fine-tuned on even a limited amount of actual data, can generate synthetic data that closely mimics the actual travel survey data, and as such provides an argument for using such data in mobility studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00063v1,2024-08
MultiMed: Massively Multimodal and Multitask Medical Understanding,"Shentong Mo, Paul Pu Liang","Biomedical data is inherently multimodal, consisting of electronic health records, medical imaging, digital pathology, genome sequencing, wearable sensors, and more. The application of artificial intelligence tools to these multifaceted sensing technologies has the potential to revolutionize the prognosis, diagnosis, and management of human health and disease. However, current approaches to biomedical AI typically only train and evaluate with one or a small set of medical modalities and tasks. This limitation hampers the development of comprehensive tools that can leverage the rich interconnected information across many heterogeneous biomedical sensors. To address this challenge, we present MultiMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate and enable large-scale learning across a wide spectrum of medical modalities and tasks. MultiMed consists of 2.56 million samples across ten medical modalities such as medical reports, pathology, genomics, and protein data, and is structured into eleven challenging tasks, including disease prognosis, protein structure prediction, and medical question answering. Using MultiMed, we conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art unimodal, multimodal, and multitask models. Our analysis highlights the advantages of training large-scale medical models across many related modalities and tasks. Moreover, MultiMed enables studies of generalization across related medical concepts, robustness to real-world noisy data and distribution shifts, and novel modality combinations to improve prediction performance. MultiMed will be publicly available and regularly updated and welcomes inputs from the community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12682v1,2024-08
Controllable Text Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey,"Xun Liang, Hanyu Wang, Yezhaohui Wang, Shichao Song, Jiawei Yang, Simin Niu, Jie Hu, Dan Liu, Shunyu Yao, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li","In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high text generation quality. However, in real-world applications, LLMs must meet increasingly complex requirements. Beyond avoiding misleading or inappropriate content, LLMs are also expected to cater to specific user needs, such as imitating particular writing styles or generating text with poetic richness. These varied demands have driven the development of Controllable Text Generation (CTG) techniques, which ensure that outputs adhere to predefined control conditions--such as safety, sentiment, thematic consistency, and linguistic style--while maintaining high standards of helpfulness, fluency, and diversity.   This paper systematically reviews the latest advancements in CTG for LLMs, offering a comprehensive definition of its core concepts and clarifying the requirements for control conditions and text quality. We categorize CTG tasks into two primary types: content control and attribute control. The key methods are discussed, including model retraining, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, prompt engineering, latent space manipulation, and decoding-time intervention. We analyze each method's characteristics, advantages, and limitations, providing nuanced insights for achieving generation control. Additionally, we review CTG evaluation methods, summarize its applications across domains, and address key challenges in current research, including reduced fluency and practicality. We also propose several appeals, such as placing greater emphasis on real-world applications in future research. This paper aims to offer valuable guidance to researchers and developers in the field.

MuMA-ToM: Multi-modal Multi-Agent Theory of Mind,"Haojun Shi, Suyu Ye, Xinyu Fang, Chuanyang Jin, Leyla Isik, Yen-Ling Kuo, Tianmin Shu","Understanding people's social interactions in complex real-world scenarios often relies on intricate mental reasoning. To truly understand how and why people interact with one another, we must infer the underlying mental states that give rise to the social interactions, i.e., Theory of Mind reasoning in multi-agent interactions. Additionally, social interactions are often multi-modal -- we can watch people's actions, hear their conversations, and/or read about their past behaviors. For AI systems to successfully and safely interact with people in real-world environments, they also need to understand people's mental states as well as their inferences about each other's mental states based on multi-modal information about their interactions. For this, we introduce MuMA-ToM, a Multi-modal Multi-Agent Theory of Mind benchmark. MuMA-ToM is the first multi-modal Theory of Mind benchmark that evaluates mental reasoning in embodied multi-agent interactions. In MuMA-ToM, we provide video and text descriptions of people's multi-modal behavior in realistic household environments. Based on the context, we then ask questions about people's goals, beliefs, and beliefs about others' goals. We validated MuMA-ToM in a human experiment and provided a human baseline. We also proposed a novel multi-modal, multi-agent ToM model, LIMP (Language model-based Inverse Multi-agent Planning). Our experimental results show that LIMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including large multi-modal models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro) and a recent multi-modal ToM model, BIP-ALM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12574v3,2024-08

Towards Evaluating and Building Versatile Large Language Models for Medicine,"Chaoyi Wu, Pengcheng Qiu, Jinxin Liu, Hongfei Gu, Na Li, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie","In this study, we present MedS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in clinical contexts. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on multiple-choice question answering, MedS-Bench spans 11 high-level clinical tasks, including clinical report summarization, treatment recommendations, diagnosis, named entity recognition, and medical concept explanation, among others. We evaluated six leading LLMs, e.g., MEDITRON, Mistral, InternLM 2, Llama 3, GPT-4, and Claude-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and found that even the most sophisticated models struggle with these complex tasks. To address these limitations, we developed MedS-Ins, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for medicine. MedS-Ins comprises 58 medically oriented language corpora, totaling 13.5 million samples across 122 tasks. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment by performing instruction tuning on a lightweight, open-source medical language model. The resulting model, MMedIns-Llama 3, significantly outperformed existing models across nearly all clinical tasks. To promote further advancements in the application of LLMs to clinical challenges, we have made the MedS-Ins dataset fully accessible and invite the research community to contribute to its expansion.Additionally, we have launched a dynamic leaderboard for MedS-Bench, which we plan to regularly update the test set to track progress and enhance the adaptation of general LLMs to the medical domain.

GenderCARE: A Comprehensive Framework for Assessing and Reducing Gender Bias in Large Language Models,"Kunsheng Tang, Wenbo Zhou, Jie Zhang, Aishan Liu, Gelei Deng, Shuai Li, Peigui Qi, Weiming Zhang, Tianwei Zhang, Nenghai Yu","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in natural language generation, but they have also been observed to magnify societal biases, particularly those related to gender. In response to this issue, several benchmarks have been proposed to assess gender bias in LLMs. However, these benchmarks often lack practical flexibility or inadvertently introduce biases. To address these shortcomings, we introduce GenderCARE, a comprehensive framework that encompasses innovative Criteria, bias Assessment, Reduction techniques, and Evaluation metrics for quantifying and mitigating gender bias in LLMs. To begin, we establish pioneering criteria for gender equality benchmarks, spanning dimensions such as inclusivity, diversity, explainability, objectivity, robustness, and realisticity. Guided by these criteria, we construct GenderPair, a novel pair-based benchmark designed to assess gender bias in LLMs comprehensively. Our benchmark provides standardized and realistic evaluations, including previously overlooked gender groups such as transgender and non-binary individuals. Furthermore, we develop effective debiasing techniques that incorporate counterfactual data augmentation and specialized fine-tuning strategies to reduce gender bias in LLMs without compromising their overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in various gender bias benchmarks, with reductions peaking at over 90% and averaging above 35% across 17 different LLMs. Importantly, these reductions come with minimal variability in mainstream language tasks, remaining below 2%. By offering a realistic assessment and tailored reduction of gender biases, we hope that our GenderCARE can represent a significant step towards achieving fairness and equity in LLMs. More details are available at https://github.com/kstanghere/GenderCARE-ccs24.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12494v1,2024-08

Enhancing Multi-hop Reasoning through Knowledge Erasure in Large Language Model Editing,"Mengqi Zhang, Bowen Fang, Qiang Liu, Pengjie Ren, Shu Wu, Zhumin Chen, Liang Wang","Large language models (LLMs) face challenges with internal knowledge inaccuracies and outdated information. Knowledge editing has emerged as a pivotal approach to mitigate these issues. Although current knowledge editing techniques exhibit promising performance in single-hop reasoning tasks, they show limitations when applied to multi-hop reasoning. Drawing on cognitive neuroscience and the operational mechanisms of LLMs, we hypothesize that the residual single-hop knowledge after editing causes edited models to revert to their original answers when processing multi-hop questions, thereby undermining their performance in multihop reasoning tasks. To validate this hypothesis, we conduct a series of experiments that empirically confirm our assumptions. Building on the validated hypothesis, we propose a novel knowledge editing method that incorporates a Knowledge Erasure mechanism for Large language model Editing (KELE). Specifically, we design an erasure function for residual knowledge and an injection function for new knowledge. Through joint optimization, we derive the optimal recall vector, which is subsequently utilized within a rank-one editing framework to update the parameters of targeted model layers. Extensive experiments on GPT-J and GPT-2 XL demonstrate that KELE substantially enhances the multi-hop reasoning capability of edited LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12456v1,2024-08
Enhancing Natural Language Inference Performance with Knowledge Graph for COVID-19 Automated Fact-Checking in Indonesian Language,"Arief Purnama Muharram, Ayu Purwarianti","Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0,8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00061v1,2024-08
Positional Description for Numerical Normalization,"Deepanshu Gupta, Javier Latorre","We present a Positional Description Scheme (PDS) tailored for digit sequences, integrating placeholder value information for each digit. Given the structural limitations of subword tokenization algorithms, language models encounter critical Text Normalization (TN) challenges when handling numerical tasks. Our schema addresses this challenge through straightforward pre-processing, preserving the model architecture while significantly simplifying number normalization, rendering the problem tractable. This simplifies the task and facilitates more compact production-ready models capable of learning from smaller datasets. Furthermore, our investigations reveal that PDS enhances the arithmetic processing capabilities of language models, resulting in a relative accuracy improvement of 23% to 51% on complex arithmetic tasks. We demonstrate that PDS effectively mitigates fatal numerical normalization errors in neural models, requiring only a modest amount of training data without rule-based Finite State Transducers (FST). We demonstrate that PDS is essential for both the Text-To-Speech and Speech Recognition text processing, enabling effective TN under production constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12430v1,2024-08
A Comparative Analysis of Faithfulness Metrics and Humans in Citation Evaluation,"Weijia Zhang, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Jiahuan Pei, Yifei Yuan, Jia-Hong Huang, Evangelos Kanoulas","Large language models (LLMs) often generate content with unsupported or unverifiable content, known as ""hallucinations."" To address this, retrieval-augmented LLMs are employed to include citations in their content, grounding the content in verifiable sources. Despite such developments, manually assessing how well a citation supports the associated statement remains a major challenge. Previous studies tackle this challenge by leveraging faithfulness metrics to estimate citation support automatically. However, they limit this citation support estimation to a binary classification scenario, neglecting fine-grained citation support in practical scenarios. To investigate the effectiveness of faithfulness metrics in fine-grained scenarios, we propose a comparative evaluation framework that assesses the metric effectiveness in distinguishing citations between three-category support levels: full, partial, and no support. Our framework employs correlation analysis, classification evaluation, and retrieval evaluation to measure the alignment between metric scores and human judgments comprehensively. Our results indicate no single metric consistently excels across all evaluations, highlighting the complexity of accurately evaluating fine-grained support levels. Particularly, we find that the best-performing metrics struggle to distinguish partial support from full or no support. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for developing more effective metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12398v1,2024-08

We explore this paradigm for the financial domain, focusing on the challenge of answering questions that require multi-hop numerical reasoning over financial texts. We assess the performance of several smaller models that have been fine-tuned to generate programs that encode the required financial reasoning and calculations. Our findings demonstrate that these fine-tuned smaller models approach the performance of the teacher model.   To provide a granular analysis of model performance, we propose an approach to investigate the specific student model capabilities that are enhanced by fine-tuning. Our empirical analysis indicates that fine-tuning refines the student models ability to express and apply the required financial concepts along with adapting the entity extraction for the specific data format. In addition, we hypothesize and demonstrate that comparable financial reasoning capability can be induced using relatively smaller datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12337v1,2024-08
Interactive DualChecker for Mitigating Hallucinations in Distilling Large Language Models,"Meiyun Wang, Masahiro Suzuki, Hiroki Sakaji, Kiyoshi Izumi","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various machine learning (ML) tasks. Given the high costs of creating annotated datasets for supervised learning, LLMs offer a valuable alternative by enabling effective few-shot in-context learning. However, these models can produce hallucinations, particularly in domains with incomplete knowledge. Additionally, current methods for knowledge distillation using LLMs often struggle to enhance the effectiveness of both teacher and student models. To address these challenges, we introduce DualChecker, an innovative framework designed to mitigate hallucinations and improve the performance of both teacher and student models during knowledge distillation. DualChecker employs ContextAligner to ensure that the context provided by teacher models aligns with human labeling standards. It also features a dynamic checker system that enhances model interaction: one component re-prompts teacher models with more detailed content when they show low confidence, and another identifies borderline cases from student models to refine the teaching templates. This interactive process promotes continuous improvement and effective knowledge transfer between the models. We evaluate DualChecker using a green innovation textual dataset that includes binary, multiclass, and token classification tasks. The experimental results show that DualChecker significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 17% improvement in F1 score for teacher models and 10% for student models. Notably, student models fine-tuned with LLM predictions perform comparably to those fine-tuned with actual data, even in a challenging domain.

Improving Factuality in Large Language Models via Decoding-Time Hallucinatory and Truthful Comparators,"Dingkang Yang, Dongling Xiao, Jinjie Wei, Mingcheng Li, Zhaoyu Chen, Ke Li, Lihua Zhang","Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generate responses that contradict verifiable facts, i.e., unfaithful hallucination content. Existing efforts generally focus on optimizing model parameters or editing semantic representations, which compromise the internal factual knowledge of target LLMs. In addition, hallucinations typically exhibit multifaceted patterns in downstream tasks, limiting the model's holistic performance across tasks. In this paper, we propose a Comparator-driven Decoding-Time (CDT) framework to alleviate the response hallucination. Firstly, we construct hallucinatory and truthful comparators with multi-task fine-tuning samples. In this case, we present an instruction prototype-guided mixture of experts strategy to enhance the ability of the corresponding comparators to capture different hallucination or truthfulness patterns in distinct task instructions. CDT constrains next-token predictions to factuality-robust distributions by contrasting the logit differences between the target LLMs and these comparators. Systematic experiments on multiple downstream tasks show that our framework can significantly improve the model performance and response factuality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12325v4,2024-08
MaVEn: An Effective Multi-granularity Hybrid Visual Encoding Framework for Multimodal Large Language Model,"Chaoya Jiang, Jia Hongrui, Haiyang Xu, Wei Ye, Mengfan Dong, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Shikun Zhang","This paper presents MaVEn, an innovative Multi-granularity Visual Encoding framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in multi-image reasoning. Current MLLMs primarily focus on single-image visual understanding, limiting their ability to interpret and integrate information across multiple images. MaVEn addresses this limitation by combining discrete visual symbol sequences, which abstract coarse-grained semantic concepts, with traditional continuous representation sequences that model fine-grained features. This dual approach bridges the semantic gap between visual and textual data, thereby improving the model's ability to process and interpret information from multiple images effectively. Additionally, we design a dynamic reduction mechanism by for long-sequence continuous features to enhance multi-image processing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that MaVEn significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding in complex multi-image scenarios, while also improving performance in single-image contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12321v2,2024-08
Large Language Models Are Self-Taught Reasoners: Enhancing LLM Applications via Tailored Problem-Solving Demonstrations,"Kai Tzu-iunn Ong, Taeyoon Kwon, Jinyoung Yeo","Guiding large language models with a selected set of human-authored demonstrations is a common practice for improving LLM applications. However, human effort can be costly, especially in specialized domains (e.g., clinical diagnosis), and does not guarantee optimal performance due to the potential discrepancy of target skills between selected demonstrations and real test instances. Motivated by these, this paper explores the automatic creation of customized demonstrations, whose target skills align with the given target instance. We present SELF-TAUGHT, a problem-solving framework, which facilitates demonstrations that are ""tailored"" to the target problem and ""filtered"" for better quality (i.e., correctness) in a zero-shot manner. In 15 tasks of multiple-choice questions of diverse domains and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with real-world patients, SELF-TAUGHT achieves superior performance to strong baselines (e.g., Few-shot CoT, Plan-and-Solve, Auto-CoT). We conduct comprehensive analyses on SELF-TAUGHT, including its generalizability to existing prompting methods and different LLMs, the quality of its intermediate generation, and more.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12315v1,2024-08
Toward the Evaluation of Large Language Models Considering Score Variance across Instruction Templates,"Yusuke Sakai, Adam Nohejl, Jiangnan Hang, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe","The natural language understanding (NLU) performance of large language models (LLMs) has been evaluated across various tasks and datasets. The existing evaluation methods, however, do not take into account the variance in scores due to differences in prompts, which leads to unfair evaluation and comparison of NLU performance. Moreover, evaluation designed for specific prompts is inappropriate for instruction tuning, which aims to perform well with any prompt. It is therefore necessary to find a way to measure NLU performance in a fair manner, considering score variance between different instruction templates. In this study, we provide English and Japanese cross-lingual datasets for evaluating the NLU performance of LLMs, which include multiple instruction templates for fair evaluation of each task, along with regular expressions to constrain the output format. Furthermore, we propose the Sharpe score as an evaluation metric that takes into account the variance in scores between templates. Comprehensive analysis of English and Japanese LLMs reveals that the high variance among templates has a significant impact on the fair evaluation of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12263v1,2024-08
A Language-agnostic Model of Child Language Acquisition,"Louis Mahon, Omri Abend, Uri Berger, Katherine Demuth, Mark Johnson, Mark Steedman","This work reimplements a recent semantic bootstrapping child-language acquisition model, which was originally designed for English, and trains it to learn a new language: Hebrew. The model learns from pairs of utterances and logical forms as meaning representations, and acquires both syntax and word meanings simultaneously. The results show that the model mostly transfers to Hebrew, but that a number of factors, including the richer morphology in Hebrew, makes the learning slower and less robust. This suggests that a clear direction for future work is to enable the model to leverage the similarities between different word forms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12254v1,2024-08
LLMs are not Zero-Shot Reasoners for Biomedical Information Extraction,"Aishik Nagar, Viktor Schlegel, Thanh-Tung Nguyen, Hao Li, Yuping Wu, Kuluhan Binici, Stefan Winkler","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation. Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extration. To breach this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge. To this end we evaluate various open LLMs -- including BioMistral and Llama-2 models -- on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora. Counter-intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain. Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required. This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12249v1,2024-08
Optimizing Performance: How Compact Models Match or Exceed GPT's Classification Capabilities through Fine-Tuning,"Baptiste Lefort, Eric Benhamou, Jean-Jacques Ohana, David Saltiel, Beatrice Guez","In this paper, we demonstrate that non-generative, small-sized models such as FinBERT and FinDRoBERTa, when fine-tuned, can outperform GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models in zero-shot learning settings in sentiment analysis for financial news. These fine-tuned models show comparable results to GPT-3.5 when it is fine-tuned on the task of determining market sentiment from daily financial news summaries sourced from Bloomberg. To fine-tune and compare these models, we created a novel database, which assigns a market score to each piece of news without human interpretation bias, systematically identifying the mentioned companies and analyzing whether their stocks have gone up, down, or remained neutral. Furthermore, the paper shows that the assumptions of Condorcet's Jury Theorem do not hold suggesting that fine-tuned small models are not independent of the fine-tuned GPT models, indicating behavioural similarities. Lastly, the resulted fine-tuned models are made publicly available on HuggingFace, providing a resource for further research in financial sentiment analysis and text classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11408v1,2024-08
EvalYaks: Instruction Tuning Datasets and LoRA Fine-tuned Models for Automated Scoring of CEFR B2 Speaking Assessment Transcripts,"Nicy Scaria, Silvester John Joseph Kennedy, Thomas Latinovich, Deepak Subramani","Relying on human experts to evaluate CEFR speaking assessments in an e-learning environment creates scalability challenges, as it limits how quickly and widely assessments can be conducted. We aim to automate the evaluation of CEFR B2 English speaking assessments in e-learning environments from conversation transcripts. First, we evaluate the capability of leading open source and commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) to score a candidate's performance across various criteria in the CEFR B2 speaking exam in both global and India-specific contexts. Next, we create a new expert-validated, CEFR-aligned synthetic conversational dataset with transcripts that are rated at different assessment scores. In addition, new instruction-tuned datasets are developed from the English Vocabulary Profile (up to CEFR B2 level) and the CEFR-SP WikiAuto datasets. Finally, using these new datasets, we perform parameter efficient instruction tuning of Mistral Instruct 7B v0.2 to develop a family of models called EvalYaks. Four models in this family are for assessing the four sections of the CEFR B2 speaking exam, one for identifying the CEFR level of vocabulary and generating level-specific vocabulary, and another for detecting the CEFR level of text and generating level-specific text. EvalYaks achieved an average acceptable accuracy of 96%, a degree of variation of 0.35 levels, and performed 3 times better than the next best model. This demonstrates that a 7B parameter LLM instruction tuned with high-quality CEFR-aligned assessment data can effectively evaluate and score CEFR B2 English speaking assessments, offering a promising solution for scalable, automated language proficiency evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12226v1,2024-08
Large Language Models as Foundations for Next-Gen Dense Retrieval: A Comprehensive Empirical Assessment,"Kun Luo, Minghao Qin, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu","Pretrained language models like BERT and T5 serve as crucial backbone encoders for dense retrieval. However, these models often exhibit limited generalization capabilities and face challenges in improving in domain accuracy. Recent research has explored using large language models (LLMs) as retrievers, achieving SOTA performance across various tasks. Despite these advancements, the specific benefits of LLMs over traditional retrievers and the impact of different LLM configurations, such as parameter sizes, pretraining duration, and alignment processes on retrieval tasks remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on a wide range of retrieval tasks, including in domain accuracy, data efficiency, zero shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction based retrieval, and multi task learning. We evaluate over 15 different backbone LLMs and non LLMs. Our findings reveal that larger models and extensive pretraining consistently enhance in domain accuracy and data efficiency. Additionally, larger models demonstrate significant potential in zero shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction based retrieval, and multi task learning. These results underscore the advantages of LLMs as versatile and effective backbone encoders in dense retrieval, providing valuable insights for future research and development in this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12194v2,2024-08
Reasoning Factual Knowledge in Structured Data with Large Language Models,"Sirui Huang, Yanggan Gu, Xuming Hu, Zhonghao Li, Qing Li, Guandong Xu","Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in various natural language processing tasks as a benefit of their capability to comprehend and reason with factual knowledge. However, a significant amount of factual knowledge is stored in structured data, which possesses unique characteristics that differ from the unstructured texts used for pretraining. This difference can introduce imperceptible inference parameter deviations, posing challenges for LLMs in effectively utilizing and reasoning with structured data to accurately infer factual knowledge. To this end, we propose a benchmark named StructFact, to evaluate the structural reasoning capabilities of LLMs in inferring factual knowledge. StructFact comprises 8,340 factual questions encompassing various tasks, domains, timelines, and regions. This benchmark allows us to investigate the capability of LLMs across five factual tasks derived from the unique characteristics of structural facts. Extensive experiments on a set of LLMs with different training strategies reveal the limitations of current LLMs in inferring factual knowledge from structured data. We present this benchmark as a compass to navigate the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in reasoning with structured data for knowledge-sensitive tasks, and to encourage advancements in related real-world applications.

Revisiting the Phenomenon of Syntactic Complexity Convergence on German Dialogue Data,"Yu Wang, Hendrik Buschmeier","We revisit the phenomenon of syntactic complexity convergence in conversational interaction, originally found for English dialogue, which has theoretical implication for dialogical concepts such as mutual understanding. We use a modified metric to quantify syntactic complexity based on dependency parsing. The results show that syntactic complexity convergence can be statistically confirmed in one of three selected German datasets that were analysed. Given that the dataset which shows such convergence is much larger than the other two selected datasets, the empirical results indicate a certain degree of linguistic generality of syntactic complexity convergence in conversational interaction. We also found a different type of syntactic complexity convergence in one of the datasets while further investigation is still necessary.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12177v1,2024-08
FIRST: Teach A Reliable Large Language Model Through Efficient Trustworthy Distillation,"KaShun Shum, Minrui Xu, Jianshu Zhang, Zixin Chen, Shizhe Diao, Hanze Dong, Jipeng Zhang, Muhammad Omer Raza","Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, leading to an expectation for LLMs to be trustworthy -- - both accurate and well-calibrated (the prediction confidence should align with its ground truth correctness likelihood). Nowadays, fine-tuning has become the most popular method for adapting a model to practical usage by significantly increasing accuracy on downstream tasks. Despite the great accuracy it achieves, we found fine-tuning is still far away from satisfactory trustworthiness due to ""tuning-induced mis-calibration"". In this paper, we delve deeply into why and how mis-calibration exists in fine-tuned models, and how distillation can alleviate the issue. Then we further propose a brand new method named Efficient Trustworthy Distillation (FIRST), which utilizes a small portion of teacher's knowledge to obtain a reliable language model in a cost-efficient way. Specifically, we identify the ""concentrated knowledge"" phenomenon during distillation, which can significantly reduce the computational burden. Then we apply a ""trustworthy maximization"" process to optimize the utilization of this small portion of concentrated knowledge before transferring it to the student. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where better accuracy (+2.3%) and less mis-calibration (-10%) are achieved on average across both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, indicating better trustworthiness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12168v2,2024-08
Preference-Guided Reflective Sampling for Aligning Language Models,"Hai Ye, Hwee Tou Ng","Iterative data generation and model re-training can effectively align large language models(LLMs) to human preferences. The process of data sampling is crucial, as it significantly influences the success of policy improvement. Repeated random sampling is a widely used method that independently queries the model multiple times to generate outputs. In this work, we propose a more effective sampling method, named Preference-Guided Reflective Sampling (PRS). Unlike random sampling, PRS employs a tree-based generation framework to enable more efficient sampling. It leverages adaptive self-refinement techniques to better explore the sampling space. By specifying user preferences in natural language, PRS can further optimize response generation according to these preferences. As a result, PRS can align models to diverse user preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PRS generates higher-quality responses with significantly higher rewards. On AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, PRS substantially outperforms repeated random sampling in best-of-$N$ sampling. Moreover, PRS shows strong performance when applied in iterative offline RL training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12163v2,2024-08
Search-Based LLMs for Code Optimization,"Shuzheng Gao, Cuiyun Gao, Wenchao Gu, Michael Lyu","The code written by developers usually suffers from efficiency problems and contain various performance bugs. These inefficiencies necessitate the research of automated refactoring methods for code optimization. Early research in code optimization employs rule-based methods and focuses on specific inefficiency issues, which are labor-intensive and suffer from the low coverage issue. Recent work regards the task as a sequence generation problem, and resorts to deep learning (DL) techniques such as large language models (LLMs). These methods typically prompt LLMs to directly generate optimized code. Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, such one-step generation paradigm is hard to achieve an optimal solution. First, complex optimization methods such as combinatorial ones are hard to be captured by LLMs. Second, the one-step generation paradigm poses challenge in precisely infusing the knowledge required for effective code optimization within LLMs, resulting in under-optimized code.To address these problems, we propose to model this task from the search perspective, and propose a search-based LLMs framework named SBLLM that enables iterative refinement and discovery of improved optimization methods. SBLLM synergistically integrate LLMs with evolutionary search and consists of three key components: 1) an execution-based representative sample selection part that evaluates the fitness of each existing optimized code and prioritizes promising ones to pilot the generation of improved code; 2) an adaptive optimization pattern retrieval part that infuses targeted optimization patterns into the model for guiding LLMs towards rectifying and progressively enhancing their optimization methods; and 3) a genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought prompting part that aids LLMs in combining different optimization methods and generating improved optimization methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12159v1,2024-08
Implicit Sentiment Analysis Based on Chain of Thought Prompting,"Zhihua Duan, Jialin Wang","Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) is a crucial research area in natural language processing. Inspired by the idea of large language model Chain of Thought (CoT), this paper introduces a Sentiment Analysis of Thinking (SAoT) framework. The framework first analyzes the implicit aspects and opinions in the text using common sense and thinking chain capabilities. Then, it reflects on the process of implicit sentiment analysis and finally deduces the polarity of sentiment. The model is evaluated on the SemEval 2014 dataset, consisting of 1120 restaurant reviews and 638 laptop reviews. The experimental results demonstrate that the utilization of the ERNIE-Bot-4+SAoT model yields a notable performance improvement. Specifically, on the restaurant dataset, the F1 score reaches 75.27, accompanied by an ISA score of 66.29. Similarly, on the computer dataset, the F1 score achieves 76.50, while the ISA score amounts to 73.46. Comparatively, the ERNIE-Bot-4+SAoT model surpasses the BERTAsp + SCAPt baseline by an average margin of 47.99%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12157v1,2024-08
A Tighter Complexity Analysis of SparseGPT,"Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song","In this work, we improved the analysis of the running time of SparseGPT [Frantar, Alistarh ICML 2023] from $O(d^{3})$ to $O(d^{\omega} + d^{2+a+o(1)} + d^{1+\omega(1,1,a)-a})$ for any $a \in [0, 1]$, where $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. In particular, for the current $\omega \approx 2.371$ [Alman, Duan, Williams, Xu, Xu, Zhou 2024], our running time boils down to $O(d^{2.53})$. This running time is due to the analysis of the lazy update behavior in iterative maintenance problems such as [Deng, Song, Weinstein 2022; Brand, Song, Zhou ICML 2024].",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12151v2,2024-08
MDD-5k: A New Diagnostic Conversation Dataset for Mental Disorders Synthesized via Neuro-Symbolic LLM Agents,"Congchi Yin, Feng Li, Shu Zhang, Zike Wang, Jun Shao, Piji Li, Jianhua Chen, Xun Jiang","The clinical diagnosis of most mental disorders primarily relies on the conversations between psychiatrist and patient. The creation of such diagnostic conversation datasets is promising to boost the AI mental healthcare community. However, directly collecting the conversations in real diagnosis scenarios is near impossible due to stringent privacy and ethical considerations. To address this issue, we seek to synthesize diagnostic conversation by exploiting anonymized patient cases that are easier to access. Specifically, we design a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing the diagnostic conversation of mental disorders with large language models. It takes patient case as input and is capable of generating multiple diverse conversations with one single patient case. The framework basically involves the interaction between a doctor agent and a patient agent, and generates conversations under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree. By applying the proposed framework, we develop the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset MDD-5k. This dataset is built upon 1000 real, anonymized patient cases by cooperating with Shanghai Mental Health Center and comprises 5000 high-quality long conversations with diagnosis results and treatment opinions as labels. To the best of our knowledge, it's also the first labeled dataset for Chinese mental disorders diagnosis. Human evaluation demonstrates the proposed MDD-5k dataset successfully simulates human-like diagnostic process of mental disorders.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12142v2,2024-08
Understanding Literary Texts by LLMs: A Case Study of Ancient Chinese Poetry,"Cheng Zhao, Bin Wang, Zhen Wang","The birth and rapid development of large language models (LLMs) have caused quite a stir in the field of literature. Once considered unattainable, AI's role in literary creation is increasingly becoming a reality. In genres such as poetry, jokes, and short stories, numerous AI tools have emerged, offering refreshing new perspectives. However, it's difficult to further improve the quality of these works. This is primarily because understanding and appreciating a good literary work involves a considerable threshold, such as knowledge of literary theory, aesthetic sensibility, interdisciplinary knowledge. Therefore, authoritative data in this area is quite lacking. Additionally, evaluating literary works is often complex and hard to fully quantify, which directly hinders the further development of AI creation.   To address this issue, this paper attempts to explore the mysteries of literary texts from the perspective of LLMs, using ancient Chinese poetry as an example for experimentation. First, we collected a variety of ancient poems from different sources and had experts annotate a small portion of them. Then, we designed a range of comprehension metrics based on LLMs to evaluate all these poems. Finally, we analyzed the correlations and differences between various poem collections to identify literary patterns. Through our experiments, we observed a series of enlightening phenomena that provide technical support for the future development of high-level literary creation based on LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00060v2,2024-08
RoVRM: A Robust Visual Reward Model Optimized via Auxiliary Textual Preference Data,"Chenglong Wang, Yang Gan, Yifu Huo, Yongyu Mu, Murun Yang, Qiaozhi He, Tong Xiao, Chunliang Zhang, Tongran Liu, Quan Du, Di Yang, Jingbo Zhu","Large vision-language models (LVLMs) often fail to align with human preferences, leading to issues like generating misleading content without proper visual context (also known as hallucination). A promising solution to this problem is using human-preference alignment techniques, such as best-of-n sampling and reinforcement learning. However, these techniques face the difficulty arising from the scarcity of visual preference data, which is required to train a visual reward model (VRM). In this work, we continue the line of research. We present a Robust Visual Reward Model (RoVRM) which improves human-preference alignment for LVLMs. RoVRM leverages auxiliary textual preference data through a three-phase progressive training and optimal transport-based preference data selection to effectively mitigate the scarcity of visual preference data. We experiment with RoVRM on the commonly used vision-language tasks based on the LLaVA-1.5-7B and -13B models. Experimental results demonstrate that RoVRM consistently outperforms traditional VRMs. Furthermore, our three-phase progressive training and preference data selection approaches can yield consistent performance gains over ranking-based alignment techniques, such as direct preference optimization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12109v1,2024-08

Identifying the appropriate machine learning models and datasets for specific tasks is crucial for the effective industrial application of machine learning. However, this requires expertise in both machine learning and the relevant domain, leading to a high learning cost. Therefore, research focused on extracting combinations of tasks, machine learning models, and datasets from academic papers is critically important, as it can facilitate the automatic recommendation of suitable methods. Conventional information extraction methods from academic papers have been limited to identifying machine learning models and other entities as named entities. To address this issue, this study proposes a methodology extracting tasks, machine learning methods, and dataset names from scientific papers and analyzing the relationships between these information by using LLM, embedding model, and network clustering. The proposed method's expression extraction performance, when using Llama3, achieves an F-score exceeding 0.8 across various categories, confirming its practical utility.

Liu, Viktor Schlegel, Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Arun-Kumar Kaliya-Perumal, Guna Pratheep Kalanchiam, Yili Tang, Robby T. Tan","Medical abstractive summarization faces the challenge of balancing faithfulness and informativeness. Current methods often sacrifice key information for faithfulness or introduce confabulations when prioritizing informativeness. While recent advancements in techniques like in-context learning (ICL) and fine-tuning have improved medical summarization, they often overlook crucial aspects such as faithfulness and informativeness without considering advanced methods like model reasoning and self-improvement. Moreover, the field lacks a unified benchmark, hindering systematic evaluation due to varied metrics and datasets. This paper addresses these gaps by presenting a comprehensive benchmark of six advanced abstractive summarization methods across three diverse datasets using five standardized metrics. Building on these findings, we propose uMedSum, a modular hybrid summarization framework that introduces novel approaches for sequential confabulation removal followed by key missing information addition, ensuring both faithfulness and informativeness. Our work improves upon previous GPT-4-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical summarization methods, significantly outperforming them in both quantitative metrics and qualitative domain expert evaluations. Notably, we achieve an average relative performance improvement of 11.8% in reference-free metrics over the previous SOTA.

Motivated by this research gap, we present ConflictBank, the first comprehensive benchmark developed to systematically evaluate knowledge conflicts from three aspects: (i) conflicts encountered in retrieved knowledge, (ii) conflicts within the models' encoded knowledge, and (iii) the interplay between these conflict forms. Our investigation delves into four model families and twelve LLM instances, meticulously analyzing conflicts stemming from misinformation, temporal discrepancies, and semantic divergences.

Reasoning and Tools for Human-Level Forecasting,"Elvis Hsieh, Preston Fu, Jonathan Chen","Language models (LMs) trained on web-scale datasets are largely successful due to their ability to memorize large amounts of training data, even if only present in a few examples. These capabilities are often desirable in evaluation on tasks such as question answering but raise questions about whether these models can exhibit genuine reasoning or succeed only at mimicking patterns from the training data. This distinction is particularly salient in forecasting tasks, where the answer is not present in the training data, and the model must reason to make logical deductions. We present Reasoning and Tools for Forecasting (RTF), a framework of reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically retrieve updated information and run numerical simulation with equipped tools. We evaluate our model with questions from competitive forecasting platforms and demonstrate that our method is competitive with and can outperform human predictions.

Limitations in Employing Natural Language Supervision for Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition -- And Ways to Overcome Them,"Harish Haresamudram, Apoorva Beedu, Mashfiqui Rabbi, Sankalita Saha, Irfan Essa, Thomas Ploetz","Cross-modal contrastive pre-training between natural language and other modalities, e.g., vision and audio, has demonstrated astonishing performance and effectiveness across a diverse variety of tasks and domains. In this paper, we investigate whether such natural language supervision can be used for wearable sensor based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and discover that-surprisingly-it performs substantially worse than standard end-to-end training and self-supervision. We identify the primary causes for this as: sensor heterogeneity and the lack of rich, diverse text descriptions of activities. To mitigate their impact, we also develop strategies and assess their effectiveness through an extensive experimental evaluation. These strategies lead to significant increases in activity recognition, bringing performance closer to supervised and self-supervised training, while also enabling the recognition of unseen activities and cross modal retrieval of videos.

Understanding Epistemic Language with a Bayesian Theory of Mind,"Lance Ying, Tan Zhi-Xuan, Lionel Wong, Vikash Mansinghka, Joshua B.

In this paper, we introduce a cognitive model of epistemic language interpretation, grounded in Bayesian inferences about other agents' goals, beliefs, and intentions: a language-augmented Bayesian theory-of-mind (LaBToM). By translating natural language into an epistemic ``language-of-thought'', then evaluating these translations against the inferences produced by inverting a probabilistic generative model of rational action and perception, LaBToM captures graded plausibility judgments about epistemic claims. We validate our model in an experiment where participants watch an agent navigate a maze to find keys hidden in boxes needed to reach their goal, then rate sentences about the agent's beliefs. In contrast with multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) and ablated models, our model correlates highly with human judgments for a wide range of expressions, including modal language, uncertainty expressions, knowledge claims, likelihood comparisons, and attributions of false belief.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12022v1,2024-08

Characterizing Online Toxicity During the 2022 Mpox Outbreak: A Computational Analysis of Topical and Network Dynamics,"Lizhou Fan, Lingyao Li, Libby Hemphill","Background: Online toxicity, encompassing behaviors such as harassment, bullying, hate speech, and the dissemination of misinformation, has become a pressing social concern in the digital age. The 2022 Mpox outbreak, initially termed ""Monkeypox"" but subsequently renamed to mitigate associated stigmas and societal concerns, serves as a poignant backdrop to this issue. Objective: In this research, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the toxic online discourse surrounding the 2022 Mpox outbreak. Our objective is to dissect its origins, characterize its nature and content, trace its dissemination patterns, and assess its broader societal implications, with the goal of providing insights that can inform strategies to mitigate such toxicity in future crises. Methods: We collected more than 1.6 million unique tweets and analyzed them from five dimensions, including context, extent, content, speaker, and intent. Utilizing BERT-based topic modeling and social network community clustering, we delineated the toxic dynamics on Twitter. Results: We identified five high-level topic categories in the toxic online discourse on Twitter, including disease (46.6%), health policy and healthcare (19.3%), homophobia (23.9%), politics (6.0%), and racism (4.1%). Through the toxicity diffusion networks of mentions, retweets, and the top users, we found that retweets of toxic content were widespread, while influential users rarely engaged with or countered this toxicity through retweets. Conclusions: By tracking topical dynamics, we can track the changing popularity of toxic content online, providing a better understanding of societal challenges. Network dynamics spotlight key social media influencers and their intents, indicating that addressing these central figures in toxic discourse can enhance crisis communication and inform policy-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11962v3,2024-08
Decoding SEC Actions: Enforcement Trends through Analyzing Blockchain litigation using LLM-based Thematic Factor Mapping,"Junliang Luo, Xihan Xiong, William Knottenbelt, Xue Liu","The proliferation of blockchain entities (persons or enterprises) exposes them to potential regulatory actions (e.g., being litigated) by regulatory authorities. Regulatory frameworks for crypto assets are actively being developed and refined, increasing the likelihood of such actions. The lack of systematic analysis of the factors driving litigation against blockchain entities leaves companies in need of clarity to navigate compliance risks. This absence of insight also deprives investors of the information for informed decision-making. This study focuses on U.S. litigation against blockchain entities, particularly by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) given its influence on global crypto regulation. Utilizing frontier pretrained language models and large language models, we systematically map all SEC complaints against blockchain companies from 2012 to 2024 to thematic factors conceptualized by our study to delineate the factors driving SEC actions. We quantify the thematic factors and assess their influence on specific legal Acts cited within the complaints on an annual basis, allowing us to discern the regulatory emphasis, patterns and conduct trend analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11961v1,2024-08
The State of Commercial Automatic French Legal Speech Recognition Systems and their Impact on Court Reporters et al,"Nicolad Garneau, Olivier Bolduc","In Quebec and Canadian courts, the transcription of court proceedings is a critical task for appeal purposes and must be certified by an official court reporter. The limited availability of qualified reporters and the high costs associated with manual transcription underscore the need for more efficient solutions. This paper examines the potential of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems to assist court reporters in transcribing legal proceedings. We benchmark three ASR models, including commercial and open-source options, on their ability to recognize French legal speech using a curated dataset. Our study evaluates the performance of these systems using the Word Error Rate (WER) metric and introduces the Sonnex Distance to account for phonetic accuracy. We also explore the broader implications of ASR adoption on court reporters, copyists, the legal system, and litigants, identifying both positive and negative impacts. The findings suggest that while current ASR systems show promise, they require further refinement to meet the specific needs of the legal domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11940v1,2024-08
Defining Boundaries: The Impact of Domain Specification on Cross-Language and Cross-Domain Transfer in Machine Translation,"Lia Shahnazaryan, Meriem Beloucif","Recent advancements in neural machine translation (NMT) have revolutionized the field, yet the dependency on extensive parallel corpora limits progress for low-resource languages and domains. Cross-lingual transfer learning offers a promising solution by utilizing data from high-resource languages but often struggles with in-domain NMT. This paper investigates zero-shot cross-lingual domain adaptation for NMT, focusing on the impact of domain specification and linguistic factors on transfer effectiveness. Using English as the source language and Spanish for fine-tuning, we evaluate multiple target languages, including Portuguese, Italian, French, Czech, Polish, and Greek. We demonstrate that both language-specific and domain-specific factors influence transfer effectiveness, with domain characteristics playing a crucial role in determining cross-domain transfer potential. We also explore the feasibility of zero-shot cross-lingual cross-domain transfer, providing insights into which domains are more responsive to transfer and why. Our results show the importance of well-defined domain boundaries and transparency in experimental setups for in-domain transfer learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11926v2,2024-08
"Ancient Wisdom, Modern Tools: Exploring Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Ancient Indian Philosophy",Priyanka Mandikal,"LLMs have revolutionized the landscape of information retrieval and knowledge dissemination. However, their application in specialized areas is often hindered by factual inaccuracies and hallucinations, especially in long-tail knowledge distributions. We explore the potential of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models for long-form question answering (LFQA) in a specialized knowledge domain. We present VedantaNY-10M, a dataset curated from extensive public discourses on the ancient Indian philosophy of Advaita Vedanta. We develop and benchmark a RAG model against a standard, non-RAG LLM, focusing on transcription, retrieval, and generation performance. Human evaluations by computational linguists and domain experts show that the RAG model significantly outperforms the standard model in producing factual and comprehensive responses having fewer hallucinations. In addition, a keyword-based hybrid retriever that emphasizes unique low-frequency terms further improves results.

"Great Memory, Shallow Reasoning: Limits of $k$NN-LMs","Shangyi Geng, Wenting Zhao, Alexander M Rush","$K$-nearest neighbor language models ($k$NN-LMs), which integrate retrieval with next-word prediction, have demonstrated strong performance in language modeling as well as downstream NLP benchmarks. These results have led researchers to argue that models trained on poor quality or outdated data could perform well by employing a $k$NN extension that has access to a higher-quality datastore. In this work, we ask whether this improved ability to recall information really translates into downstream abilities. We extensively evaluate $k$NN-LMs on a diverse set of tasks, ranging from sentiment classification and commonsense reasoning to multi-hop reasoning. Results show that $k$NN-LMs excel at memory-intensive tasks, where utilizing the patterns in the input is sufficient for determining the output, but struggle with reasoning tasks that require integrating multiple pieces of information to derive new knowledge. We further demonstrate through oracle experiments and qualitative analysis that even with perfect retrieval, $k$NN-LMs still fail to determine the correct answers, placing an upper bound on their reasoning performance.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to generate a domain relevant RAG benchmark. Our framework is based on automatic question-answer generation with Human (domain experts)-AI Large Language Model (LLM) teaming. As a case study, we demonstrate the framework by introducing WeQA, a first-of-its-kind benchmark on the wind energy domain which comprises of multiple scientific documents/reports related to environmental impact of wind energy projects.

Practical token pruning for foundation models in few-shot conversational virtual assistant systems,"Haode Qi, Cheng Qian, Jian Ni, Pratyush Singh, Reza Fazeli, Gengyu Wang, Zhongzheng Shu, Eric Wayne, Juergen Bross","In an enterprise Virtual Assistant (VA) system, intent classification is the crucial component that determines how a user input is handled based on what the user wants. The VA system is expected to be a cost-efficient SaaS service with low training and inference time while achieving high accuracy even with a small number of training samples. We pretrain a transformer-based sentence embedding model with a contrastive learning objective and leverage the embedding of the model as features when training intent classification models. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results for few-shot scenarios and performs better than other commercial solutions on popular intent classification benchmarks. However, generating features via a transformer-based model increases the inference time, especially for longer user inputs, due to the quadratic runtime of the transformer's attention mechanism. On top of model distillation, we introduce a practical multi-task adaptation approach that configures dynamic token pruning without the need for task-specific training for intent classification. We demonstrate that this approach improves the inference speed of popular sentence transformer models without affecting model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11799v1,2024-08

We introduce \texttt{DreamFactory}, an LLM-based framework that tackles this challenge. \texttt{DreamFactory} leverages multi-agent collaboration principles and a Key Frames Iteration Design Method to ensure consistency and style across long videos. It utilizes Chain of Thought (COT) to address uncertainties inherent in large language models. \texttt{DreamFactory} generates long, stylistically coherent, and complex videos. Evaluating these long-form videos presents a challenge. We propose novel metrics such as Cross-Scene Face Distance Score and Cross-Scene Style Consistency Score.

Personality Alignment of Large Language Models,"Minjun Zhu, Linyi Yang, Yue Zhang","Current methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) typically aim to reflect general human values and behaviors, but they often fail to capture the unique characteristics and preferences of individual users. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Personality Alignment. This approach tailors LLMs' responses and decisions to match the specific preferences of individual users or closely related groups. Inspired by psychometrics, we created the Personality Alignment with Personality Inventories (PAPI) dataset, which includes data from 300,000 real subjects, each providing behavioral preferences based on the Big Five Personality Factors. This dataset allows us to quantitatively evaluate the extent to which LLMs can align with each subject's behavioral patterns. Recognizing the challenges of personality alignments: such as limited personal data, diverse preferences, and scalability requirements: we developed an activation intervention optimization method. This method enhances LLMs' ability to efficiently align with individual behavioral preferences using minimal data and computational resources. Remarkably, our method, PAS, achieves superior performance while requiring only 1/5 of the optimization time compared to DPO, offering practical value for personality alignment. Our work paves the way for future AI systems to make decisions and reason in truly personality ways, enhancing the relevance and meaning of AI interactions for each user and advancing human-centered artificial intelligence.The code has released in \url{https://github.com/zhu-minjun/PAlign}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11779v1,2024-08
Leveraging Fine-Tuned Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-Context Support: For 3GPP Standards,"Omar Erak, Nouf Alabbasi, Omar Alhussein, Ismail Lotfi, Amr Hussein, Sami Muhaidat, Merouane Debbah","Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with technical standards in telecommunications. We propose a fine-tuned retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on the Phi-2 small language model (SLM) to serve as an oracle for communication networks. Our developed system leverages forward-looking semantic chunking to adaptively determine parsing breakpoints based on embedding similarity, enabling effective processing of diverse document formats. To handle the challenge of multiple similar contexts in technical standards, we employ a re-ranking algorithm to prioritize the most relevant retrieved chunks. Recognizing the limitations of Phi-2's small context window, we implement a recent technique, namely SelfExtend, to expand the context window during inference, which not only boosts the performance but also can accommodate a wider range of user queries and design requirements from customers to specialized technicians. For fine-tuning, we utilize the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique to enhance computational efficiency during training and enable effective fine-tuning on small datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing question-answering approaches in the telecom domain, achieving performance that exceeds larger language models such as GPT-4 (which is about 880 times larger in size). This work presents a novel approach to leveraging SLMs for communication networks, offering a balance of efficiency and performance. This work can serve as a foundation towards agentic language models for networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11775v1,2024-08
"Against All Odds: Overcoming Typology, Script, and Language Confusion in Multilingual Embedding Inversion Attacks","Yiyi Chen, Russa Biswas, Heather Lent, Johannes Bjerva","Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to malicious influence by cyber attackers through intrusions such as adversarial, backdoor, and embedding inversion attacks. In response, the burgeoning field of LLM Security aims to study and defend against such threats. Thus far, the majority of works in this area have focused on monolingual English models, however, emerging research suggests that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to various attacks than their monolingual counterparts. While previous work has investigated embedding inversion over a small subset of European languages, it is challenging to extrapolate these findings to languages from different linguistic families and with differing scripts. To this end, we explore the security of multilingual LLMs in the context of embedding inversion attacks and investigate cross-lingual and cross-script inversion across 20 languages, spanning over 8 language families and 12 scripts. Our findings indicate that languages written in Arabic script and Cyrillic script are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion, as are languages within the Indo-Aryan language family. We further observe that inversion models tend to suffer from language confusion, sometimes greatly reducing the efficacy of an attack. Accordingly, we systematically explore this bottleneck for inversion models, uncovering predictable patterns which could be leveraged by attackers. Ultimately, this study aims to further the field's understanding of the outstanding security vulnerabilities facing multilingual LLMs and raise awareness for the languages most at risk of negative impact from these attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11749v2,2024-08
FocusLLM: Precise Understanding of Long Context by Dynamic Condensing,"Zhenyu Li, Yike Zhang, Tengyu Pan, Yutao Sun, Zhichao Duan, Junjie Fang, Rong Han, Zixuan Wang, Jianyong Wang","Empowering LLMs with the ability to precisely understand long contexts is crucial for many downstream applications. However, handling long contexts with conventional transformer architecture requires substantial training and inference resources. Existing context condensing methods cannot accurately understand the full context, as there is a considerable amount of information loss in the condensing process. To address these issues, we present FocusLLM, a framework designed to extend the fixed context length of any decoder-only LLM, allowing the model to focus on relevant information from very long sequences. FocusLLM first divides long text input into chunks based on the model's original context length. It then employs the dynamic condensing process to distill crucial information from each chunk. Ultimately, through the novel parallel decoding mechanism, FocusLLM can integrate the extracted information into its local context. FocusLLM stands out for great training efficiency and versatility: trained with an 8K input length and with much less training cost than previous methods, FocusLLM exhibits superior performance across downstream tasks and maintains strong language modeling ability when handling extensive long texts, even up to 400K tokens.

Efficient Detection of Toxic Prompts in Large Language Models,"Yi Liu, Junzhe Yu, Huijia Sun, Ling Shi, Gelei Deng, Yuqi Chen, Yang Liu","Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications.

Xinyu: An Efficient LLM-based System for Commentary Generation,"Yiquan Wu, Bo Tang, Chenyang Xi, Yu Yu, Pengyu Wang, Yifei Liu, Kun Kuang, Haiying Deng, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Jie Hu, Peng Cheng, Zhonghao Wang, Yi Wang, Yi Luo, Mingchuan Yang","Commentary provides readers with a deep understanding of events by presenting diverse arguments and evidence. However, creating commentary is a time-consuming task, even for skilled commentators. Large language models (LLMs) have simplified the process of natural language generation, but their direct application in commentary creation still faces challenges due to unique task requirements. These requirements can be categorized into two levels: 1) fundamental requirements, which include creating well-structured and logically consistent narratives, and 2) advanced requirements, which involve generating quality arguments and providing convincing evidence. In this paper, we introduce Xinyu, an efficient LLM-based system designed to assist commentators in generating Chinese commentaries. To meet the fundamental requirements, we deconstruct the generation process into sequential steps, proposing targeted strategies and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for each step. To address the advanced requirements, we present an argument ranking model for arguments and establish a comprehensive evidence database that includes up-to-date events and classic books, thereby strengthening the substantiation of the evidence with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology. To evaluate the generated commentaries more fairly, corresponding to the two-level requirements, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation metric that considers five distinct perspectives in commentary generation. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed system. We also observe a significant increase in the efficiency of commentators in real-world scenarios, with the average time spent on creating a commentary dropping from 4 hours to 20 minutes. Importantly, such an increase in efficiency does not compromise the quality of the commentaries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11609v2,2024-08
Cause-Aware Empathetic Response Generation via Chain-of-Thought Fine-Tuning,"Xinhao Chen, Chong Yang, Man Lan, Li Cai, Yang Chen, Tu Hu, Xinlin Zhuang, Aimin Zhou","Empathetic response generation endows agents with the capability to comprehend dialogue contexts and react to expressed emotions. Previous works predominantly focus on leveraging the speaker's emotional labels, but ignore the importance of emotion cause reasoning in empathetic response generation, which hinders the model's capacity for further affective understanding and cognitive inference. In this paper, we propose a cause-aware empathetic generation approach by integrating emotions and causes through a well-designed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt on Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach can greatly promote LLMs' performance of empathy by instruction tuning and enhancing the role awareness of an empathetic listener in the prompt. Additionally, we propose to incorporate cause-oriented external knowledge from COMET into the prompt, which improves the diversity of generation and alleviates conflicts between internal and external knowledge at the same time.

Large Language Models are Good Attackers: Efficient and Stealthy Textual Backdoor Attacks,"Ziqiang Li, Yueqi Zeng, Pengfei Xia, Lei Liu, Zhangjie Fu, Bin Li","With the burgeoning advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP), the demand for training data has increased significantly. To save costs, it has become common for users and businesses to outsource the labor-intensive task of data collection to third-party entities. Unfortunately, recent research has unveiled the inherent risk associated with this practice, particularly in exposing NLP systems to potential backdoor attacks. Specifically, these attacks enable malicious control over the behavior of a trained model by poisoning a small portion of the training data. Unlike backdoor attacks in computer vision, textual backdoor attacks impose stringent requirements for attack stealthiness. However, existing attack methods meet significant trade-off between effectiveness and stealthiness, largely due to the high information entropy inherent in textual data. In this paper, we introduce the Efficient and Stealthy Textual backdoor attack method, EST-Bad, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Our EST-Bad encompasses three core strategies: optimizing the inherent flaw of models as the trigger, stealthily injecting triggers with LLMs, and meticulously selecting the most impactful samples for backdoor injection. Through the integration of these techniques, EST-Bad demonstrates an efficient achievement of competitive attack performance while maintaining superior stealthiness compared to prior methods across various text classifier datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11587v1,2024-08

Differentiating Choices via Commonality for Multiple-Choice Question Answering,"Wenqing Deng, Zhe Wang, Kewen Wang, Shirui Pan, Xiaowang Zhang, Zhiyong Feng","Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) becomes particularly challenging when all choices are relevant to the question and are semantically similar. Yet this setting of MCQA can potentially provide valuable clues for choosing the right answer. Existing models often rank each choice separately, overlooking the context provided by other choices. Specifically, they fail to leverage the semantic commonalities and nuances among the choices for reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel MCQA model by differentiating choices through identifying and eliminating their commonality, called DCQA. Our model captures token-level attention of each choice to the question, and separates tokens of the question attended to by all the choices (i.e., commonalities) from those by individual choices (i.e., nuances). Using the nuances as refined contexts for the choices, our model can effectively differentiate choices with subtle differences and provide justifications for choosing the correct answer. We conduct comprehensive experiments across five commonly used MCQA benchmarks, demonstrating that DCQA consistently outperforms baseline models. Furthermore, our case study illustrates the effectiveness of the approach in directing the attention of the model to more differentiating features.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11554v1,2024-08
Memorization in In-Context Learning,"Shahriar Golchin, Mihai Surdeanu, Steven Bethard, Eduardo Blanco, Ellen Riloff","In-context learning (ICL) has proven to be an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) with no additional training. However, the exact mechanism behind this performance improvement remains unclear. This study is the first to show how ICL surfaces memorized training data and to explore the correlation between this memorization and performance on downstream tasks across various ICL regimes: zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot. Our most notable findings include: (1) ICL significantly surfaces memorization compared to zero-shot learning in most cases; (2) demonstrations, without their labels, are the most effective element in surfacing memorization; (3) ICL improves performance when the surfaced memorization in few-shot regimes reaches a high level (about 40%); and (4) there is a very strong correlation between performance and memorization in ICL when it outperforms zero-shot learning. Overall, our study uncovers memorization as a new factor impacting ICL, raising an important question: to what extent do LLMs truly generalize from demonstrations in ICL, and how much of their success is due to memorization?",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11546v2,2024-08

IKUN for WMT24 General MT Task: LLMs Are here for Multilingual Machine Translation,"Baohao Liao, Christian Herold, Shahram Khadivi, Christof Monz","This paper introduces two multilingual systems, IKUN and IKUN-C, developed for the general machine translation task in WMT24. IKUN and IKUN-C represent an open system and a constrained system, respectively, built on Llama-3-8b and Mistral-7B-v0.3. Both systems are designed to handle all 11 language directions using a single model. According to automatic evaluation metrics, IKUN-C achieved 6 first-place and 3 second-place finishes among all constrained systems, while IKUN secured 1 first-place and 2 second-place finishes across both open and constrained systems. These encouraging results suggest that large language models (LLMs) are nearing the level of proficiency required for effective multilingual machine translation. The systems are based on a two-stage approach: first, continuous pre-training on monolingual data in 10 languages, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality parallel data for 11 language directions. The primary difference between IKUN and IKUN-C lies in their monolingual pre-training strategy. IKUN-C is pre-trained using constrained monolingual data, whereas IKUN leverages monolingual data from the OSCAR dataset. In the second phase, both systems are fine-tuned on parallel data sourced from NTREX, Flores, and WMT16-23 for all 11 language pairs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11512v2,2024-08
DocTabQA: Answering Questions from Long Documents Using Tables,"Haochen Wang, Kai Hu, Haoyu Dong, Liangcai Gao","We study a new problem setting of question answering (QA), referred to as DocTabQA. Within this setting, given a long document, the goal is to respond to questions by organizing the answers into structured tables derived directly from the document's content. Unlike traditional QA approaches which predominantly rely on unstructured text to formulate responses, DocTabQA aims to leverage structured tables as answers to convey information clearly and systematically, thereby enhancing user comprehension and highlighting relationships between data points. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been previously explored. In this paper, we introduce the QTabA dataset, encompassing 300 financial documents, accompanied by manually annotated 1.5k question-table pairs. Initially, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to establish a baseline. However, it is widely acknowledged that LLMs encounter difficulties when tasked with generating intricate, structured outputs from long input sequences. To overcome these challenges, we present a two-stage framework, called DocTabTalk, which initially retrieves relevant sentences from extensive documents and subsequently generates hierarchical tables based on these identified sentences. DocTabTalk incorporates two key technological innovations: AlignLLaMA and TabTalk, which are specifically tailored to assist GPT-4 in tackling DocTabQA, enabling it to generate well-structured, hierarchical tables with improved organization and clarity. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on both QTabA and RotoWire datasets demonstrate that our DocTabTalk significantly enhances the performances of the GPT-4 in our proposed DocTabQA task and the table generation task.

The Self-Contained Negation Test Set,"David Kletz, Pascal Amsili, Marie Candito","Several methodologies have recently been proposed to evaluate the ability of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to interpret negation. In this article, we build on Gubelmann and Handschuh (2022), which studies the modification of PLMs' predictions as a function of the polarity of inputs, in English. Crucially, this test uses ``self-contained'' inputs ending with a masked position: depending on the polarity of a verb in the input, a particular token is either semantically ruled out or allowed at the masked position. By replicating Gubelmann and Handschuh (2022) experiments, we have uncovered flaws that weaken the conclusions that can be drawn from this test. We thus propose an improved version, the Self-Contained Neg Test, which is more controlled, more systematic, and entirely based on examples forming minimal pairs varying only in the presence or absence of verbal negation in English. When applying our test to the roberta and bert base and large models, we show that only roberta-large shows trends that match the expectations, while bert-base is mostly insensitive to negation. For all the tested models though, in a significant number of test instances the top-1 prediction remains the token that is semantically forbidden by the context, which shows how much room for improvement remains for a proper treatment of the negation phenomenon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11469v1,2024-08
Expanding FLORES+ Benchmark for more Low-Resource Settings: Portuguese-Emakhuwa Machine Translation Evaluation,"Felermino D. M. Antonio Ali, Henrique Lopes Cardoso, Rui Sousa-Silva","As part of the Open Language Data Initiative shared tasks, we have expanded the FLORES+ evaluation set to include Emakhuwa, a low-resource language widely spoken in Mozambique. We translated the dev and devtest sets from Portuguese into Emakhuwa, and we detail the translation process and quality assurance measures used. Our methodology involved various quality checks, including post-editing and adequacy assessments. The resulting datasets consist of multiple reference sentences for each source. We present baseline results from training a Neural Machine Translation system and fine-tuning existing multilingual translation models. Our findings suggest that spelling inconsistencies remain a challenge in Emakhuwa. Additionally, the baseline models underperformed on this evaluation set, underscoring the necessity for further research to enhance machine translation quality for Emakhuwa. The data is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LIACC/Emakhuwa-FLORES.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11457v1,2024-08
Distributional Properties of Subword Regularization,"Marco Cognetta, Vilém Zouhar, Naoaki Okazaki","Subword regularization, used widely in NLP, improves model performance by reducing the dependency on exact tokenizations, augmenting the training corpus, and exposing the model to more unique contexts during training. BPE and MaxMatch, two popular subword tokenization schemes, have stochastic dropout regularization variants. However, there has not been an analysis of the distributions formed by them. We show that these stochastic variants are heavily biased towards a small set of tokenizations per word. If the benefits of subword regularization are as mentioned, we hypothesize that biasedness artificially limits the effectiveness of these schemes. Thus, we propose an algorithm to uniformly sample tokenizations that we use as a drop-in replacement for the stochastic aspects of existing tokenizers, and find that it improves machine translation quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11443v1,2024-08
LAHAJA: A Robust Multi-accent Benchmark for Evaluating Hindi ASR Systems,"Tahir Javed, Janki Nawale, Sakshi Joshi, Eldho George, Kaushal Bhogale, Deovrat Mehendale, Mitesh M. Khapra","Hindi, one of the most spoken language of India, exhibits a diverse array of accents due to its usage among individuals from diverse linguistic origins. To enable a robust evaluation of Hindi ASR systems on multiple accents, we create a benchmark, LAHAJA, which contains read and extempore speech on a diverse set of topics and use cases, with a total of 12.5 hours of Hindi audio, sourced from 132 speakers spanning 83 districts of India. We evaluate existing open-source and commercial models on LAHAJA and find their performance to be poor. We then train models using different datasets and find that our model trained on multilingual data with good speaker diversity outperforms existing models by a significant margin. We also present a fine-grained analysis which shows that the performance declines for speakers from North-East and South India, especially with content heavy in named entities and specialized terminology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11440v1,2024-08
Diagnosing and Remedying Knowledge Deficiencies in LLMs via Label-free Curricular Meaningful Learning,"Kai Xiong, Xiao Ding, Li Du, Jiahao Ying, Ting Liu, Bing Qin, Yixin Cao","Large Language Models (LLMs) are versatile and demonstrate impressive generalization ability by mining and learning information from extensive unlabeled text. However, they still exhibit reasoning mistakes, often stemming from knowledge deficiencies, which can affect their trustworthiness and reliability. Although users can provide diverse and comprehensive queries, obtaining sufficient and effective feedback is demanding. Furthermore, evaluating LLMs comprehensively with limited labeled samples is difficult. This makes it a challenge to diagnose and remedy the deficiencies of LLMs through rich label-free user queries. To tackle this challenge, we propose a label-free curricular meaningful learning framework (LaMer). LaMer first employs relative entropy to automatically diagnose and quantify the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs in a label-free setting. Next, to remedy the diagnosed knowledge deficiencies, we apply curricular meaningful learning: first, we adopt meaningful learning to adaptively synthesize augmentation data according to the severity of the deficiencies, and then design a curricular deficiency remedy strategy to remedy the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs progressively. Experiments show that LaMer efficiently and effectively diagnoses and remedies knowledge deficiencies in LLMs, improving various LLMs across seven out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning and language understanding benchmarks, achieving comparable results to baselines with just 40\% training data. LaMer even surpasses methods that rely on labeled datasets for deficiency diagnosis. In application, our label-free method can offer an effective knowledge deficiency diagnostic tool for efficient LLM development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11431v1,2024-08
"Towards ""Differential AI Psychology"" and in-context Value-driven Statement Alignment with Moral Foundations Theory",Simon Münker,"Contemporary research in social sciences is increasingly utilizing state-of-the-art statistical language models to annotate or generate content. While these models perform benchmark-leading on common language tasks and show exemplary task-independent emergent abilities, transferring them to novel out-of-domain tasks is only insufficiently explored. The implications of the statistical black-box approach - stochastic parrots - are prominently criticized in the language model research community; however, the significance for novel generative tasks is not.   This work investigates the alignment between personalized language models and survey participants on a Moral Foundation Theory questionnaire. We adapt text-to-text models to different political personas and survey the questionnaire repetitively to generate a synthetic population of persona and model combinations. Analyzing the intra-group variance and cross-alignment shows significant differences across models and personas. Our findings indicate that adapted models struggle to represent the survey-captured assessment of political ideologies. Thus, using language models to mimic social interactions requires measurable improvements in in-context optimization or parameter manipulation to align with psychological and sociological stereotypes. Without quantifiable alignment, generating politically nuanced content remains unfeasible. To enhance these representations, we propose a testable framework to generate agents based on moral value statements for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11415v1,2024-08
MoE-LPR: Multilingual Extension of Large Language Models through Mixture-of-Experts with Language Priors Routing,"Hao Zhou, Zhijun Wang, Shujian Huang, Xin Huang, Xue Han, Junlan Feng, Chao Deng, Weihua Luo, Jiajun Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) are often English-centric due to the disproportionate distribution of languages in their pre-training data. Enhancing non-English language capabilities through post-pretraining often results in catastrophic forgetting of the ability of original languages. Previous methods either achieve good expansion with severe forgetting or slight forgetting with poor expansion, indicating the challenge of balancing language expansion while preventing forgetting. In this paper, we propose a method called MoE-LPR (Mixture-of-Experts with Language Priors Routing) to alleviate this problem. MoE-LPR employs a two-stage training approach to enhance the multilingual capability. First, the model is post-pretrained into a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture by upcycling, where all the original parameters are frozen and new experts are added. In this stage, we focus improving the ability on expanded languages, without using any original language data. Then, the model reviews the knowledge of the original languages with replay data amounting to less than 1% of post-pretraining, where we incorporate language priors routing to better recover the abilities of the original languages. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that MoE-LPR outperforms other post-pretraining methods. Freezing original parameters preserves original language knowledge while adding new experts preserves the learning ability. Reviewing with LPR enables effective utilization of multilingual knowledge within the parameters. Additionally, the MoE architecture maintains the same inference overhead while increasing total model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate MoE-LPR's effectiveness in improving expanded languages and preserving original language proficiency with superior scalability.

First Activations Matter: Training-Free Methods for Dynamic Activation in Large Language Models,"Chi Ma, Mincong Huang, Ying Zhang, Chao Wang, Yujie Wang, Lei Yu, Chuan Liu, Wei Lin","Dynamic activation (DA) techniques, such as DejaVu and MoEfication, have demonstrated their potential to significantly enhance the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, these techniques often rely on ReLU activation functions or require additional parameters and training to maintain performance. This paper introduces a training-free Threshold-based Dynamic Activation(TDA) method that leverage sequence information to exploit the inherent sparsity of models across various architectures. This method is designed to accelerate generation speed by 18-25\% without significantly compromising task performance, thereby addressing the limitations of existing DA techniques. Moreover, we delve into the root causes of LLM sparsity and theoretically analyze two of its critical features: history-related activation uncertainty and semantic-irrelevant activation inertia. Our comprehensive analyses not only provide a robust theoretical foundation for DA methods but also offer valuable insights to guide future research in optimizing LLMs for greater efficiency and effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11393v1,2024-08
Towards Inducing Document-Level Abilities in Standard Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models,"Varun Gumma, Pranjal A. Chitale, Kalika Bali","Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have traditionally used Sinusoidal Positional Embeddings (PEs), which often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and are less efficient for handling extended context or document-level translation tasks. This work addresses the challenge of transitioning pre-trained NMT models from absolute sinusoidal PEs to relative PEs, such as Rotary Positional Embeddings (ROPE) and Attention with Linear Biases (ALIBI), without compromising performance. We demonstrate that parameter-efficient fine-tuning, using only a small amount of high-quality data, can successfully facilitate this transition. Experimental results indicate that switching from sinusoidal to relative PEs results in competitive translation quality on sentence-level evaluation benchmarks. Additionally, models trained with ROPE consistently outperform those using ALIBI and Sinusoidal PEs on document-level benchmarks across both string-based metrics and qualitative evaluations. Moreover, we find that a small amount of long-context data in a few languages is sufficient for cross-lingual length generalization, thereby inducing long-context capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11382v2,2024-08
RAGLAB: A Modular and Research-Oriented Unified Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Xuanwang Zhang, Yunze Song, Yidong Wang, Shuyun Tang, Xinfeng Li, Zhengran Zeng, Zhen Wu, Wei Ye, Wenyuan Xu, Yue Zhang, Xinyu Dai, Shikun Zhang, Qingsong Wen","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level capabilities in dialogue, reasoning, and knowledge retention. However, even the most advanced LLMs face challenges such as hallucinations and real-time updating of their knowledge. Current research addresses this bottleneck by equipping LLMs with external knowledge, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, two key issues constrained the development of RAG. First, there is a growing lack of comprehensive and fair comparisons between novel RAG algorithms. Second, open-source tools such as LlamaIndex and LangChain employ high-level abstractions, which results in a lack of transparency and limits the ability to develop novel algorithms and evaluation metrics. To close this gap, we introduce RAGLAB, a modular and research-oriented open-source library. RAGLAB reproduces 6 existing algorithms and provides a comprehensive ecosystem for investigating RAG algorithms. Leveraging RAGLAB, we conduct a fair comparison of 6 RAG algorithms across 10 benchmarks. With RAGLAB, researchers can efficiently compare the performance of various algorithms and develop novel algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11381v2,2024-08
GeoReasoner: Reasoning On Geospatially Grounded Context For Natural Language Understanding,"Yibo Yan, Joey Lee","In human reading and communication, individuals tend to engage in geospatial reasoning, which involves recognizing geographic entities and making informed inferences about their interrelationships. To mimic such cognitive process, current methods either utilize conventional natural language understanding toolkits, or directly apply models pretrained on geo-related natural language corpora. However, these methods face two significant challenges: i) they do not generalize well to unseen geospatial scenarios, and ii) they overlook the importance of integrating geospatial context from geographical databases with linguistic information from the Internet. To handle these challenges, we propose GeoReasoner, a language model capable of reasoning on geospatially grounded natural language. Specifically, it first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a comprehensive location description based on linguistic and geospatial information. It also encodes direction and distance information into spatial embedding via treating them as pseudo-sentences. Consequently, the model is trained on both anchor-level and neighbor-level inputs to learn geo-entity representation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate GeoReasoner's superiority in three tasks: toponym recognition, toponym linking, and geo-entity typing, compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11366v1,2024-08
Clinical Context-aware Radiology Report Generation from Medical Images using Transformers,Sonit Singh,"Recent developments in the field of Natural Language Processing, especially language models such as the transformer have brought state-of-the-art results in language understanding and language generation. In this work, we investigate the use of the transformer model for radiology report generation from chest X-rays. We also highlight limitations in evaluating radiology report generation using only the standard language generation metrics. We then applied a transformer based radiology report generation architecture, and also compare the performance of a transformer based decoder with the recurrence based decoder. Experiments were performed using the IU-CXR dataset, showing superior results to its LSTM counterpart and being significantly faster. Finally, we identify the need of evaluating radiology report generation system using both language generation metrics and classification metrics, which helps to provide robust measure of generated reports in terms of their coherence and diagnostic value.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11344v1,2024-08
SORSA: Singular Values and Orthonormal Regularized Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models,Yang Cao,"In this paper, we propose Singular Values and Orthonormal Regularized Singular Vectors Adaptation, or SORSA, a novel PEFT method. Each SORSA adapter consists of two main parts: trainable principal singular weights $W_p = U_p \text{diag}(S_p) V^\top_p$, and frozen residual weights $W_r = U_r \text{diag}(S_r) V^\top_r$. These parts are initialized by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) on pre-trained weights. Moreover, we implement and analyze an orthonormal regularizer, which we prove could decrease the condition number of $W_p$ and make the optimization more efficient. SORSA adapters could be merged during inference, thus eliminating any inference latency. We also introduce a method to analyze the variation of the parameters by performing SVD and discuss and analyze SORSA's superiority in minimizing the alteration in the SVD aspect. After all, SORSA shows a faster convergence than LoRA and PiSSA in our experiments. On the GSM-8K benchmark, Llama 2 7B adapted using SORSA achieved 56.03% accuracy, surpassing LoRA (42.30%), AdaLoRA (47.30%), Full FT (49.05%), and PiSSA (53.07%). On the MATH benchmark, SORSA achieved 10.36% accuracy, outperforming LoRA (5.50%), AdaLoRA (6.48%), Full FT (7.22%), and PiSSA (7.44%). We conclude that SORSA offers a new perspective on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, demonstrating remarkable performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00055v5,2024-08
BURExtract-Llama: An LLM for Clinical Concept Extraction in Breast Ultrasound Reports,"Yuxuan Chen, Haoyan Yang, Hengkai Pan, Fardeen Siddiqui, Antonio Verdone, Qingyang Zhang, Sumit Chopra, Chen Zhao, Yiqiu Shen","Breast ultrasound is essential for detecting and diagnosing abnormalities, with radiology reports summarizing key findings like lesion characteristics and malignancy assessments. Extracting this critical information is challenging due to the unstructured nature of these reports, with varied linguistic styles and inconsistent formatting. While proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 are effective, they are costly and raise privacy concerns when handling protected health information. This study presents a pipeline for developing an in-house LLM to extract clinical information from radiology reports. We first use GPT-4 to create a small labeled dataset, then fine-tune a Llama3-8B model on it. Evaluated on clinician-annotated reports, our model achieves an average F1 score of 84.6%, which is on par with GPT-4. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing an in-house LLM that not only matches GPT-4's performance but also offers cost reductions and enhanced data privacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11334v1,2024-08
Design Principle Transfer in Neural Architecture Search via Large Language Models,"Xun Zhou, Xingyu Wu, Liang Feng, Zhichao Lu, Kay Chen Tan","Transferable neural architecture search (TNAS) has been introduced to design efficient neural architectures for multiple tasks, to enhance the practical applicability of NAS in real-world scenarios. In TNAS, architectural knowledge accumulated in previous search processes is reused to warm up the architecture search for new tasks. However, existing TNAS methods still search in an extensive search space, necessitating the evaluation of numerous architectures. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel transfer paradigm, i.e., design principle transfer. In this work, the linguistic description of various structural components' effects on architectural performance is termed design principles. They are learned from established architectures and then can be reused to reduce the search space by discarding unpromising architectures. Searching in the refined search space can boost both the search performance and efficiency for new NAS tasks. To this end, a large language model (LLM)-assisted design principle transfer (LAPT) framework is devised. In LAPT, LLM is applied to automatically reason the design principles from a set of given architectures, and then a principle adaptation method is applied to refine these principles progressively based on the new search results. Experimental results show that LAPT can beat the state-of-the-art TNAS methods on most tasks and achieve comparable performance on others.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11330v2,2024-08
"Plug, Play, and Fuse: Zero-Shot Joint Decoding via Word-Level Re-ranking Across Diverse Vocabularies","Sai Koneru, Matthias Huck, Miriam Exel, Jan Niehues","Recent advancements in NLP have resulted in models with specialized strengths, such as processing multimodal inputs or excelling in specific domains. However, real-world tasks, like multimodal translation, often require a combination of these strengths, such as handling both translation and image processing. While individual translation and vision models are powerful, they typically lack the ability to perform both tasks in a single system. Combining these models poses challenges, particularly due to differences in their vocabularies, which limit the effectiveness of traditional ensemble methods to post-generation techniques like N-best list re-ranking. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot ensembling strategy that allows for the integration of different models during the decoding phase without the need for additional training. Our approach re-ranks beams during decoding by combining scores at the word level, using heuristics to predict when a word is completed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in machine translation scenarios, showing that it enables the generation of translations that are both speech- and image-aware while also improving overall translation quality (We will release the code upon paper acceptance.).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11327v2,2024-08
SarcasmBench: Towards Evaluating Large Language Models on Sarcasm Understanding,"Yazhou Zhang, Chunwang Zou, Zheng Lian, Prayag Tiwari, Jing Qin","In the era of large language models (LLMs), the task of ``System I''~-~the fast, unconscious, and intuitive tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification, etc., have been argued to be successfully solved. However, sarcasm, as a subtle linguistic phenomenon, often employs rhetorical devices like hyperbole and figuration to convey true sentiments and intentions, involving a higher level of abstraction than sentiment analysis. There is growing concern that the argument about LLMs' success may not be fully tenable when considering sarcasm understanding. To address this question, we select eleven SOTA LLMs and eight SOTA pre-trained language models (PLMs) and present comprehensive evaluations on six widely used benchmark datasets through different prompting approaches, i.e., zero-shot input/output (IO) prompting, few-shot IO prompting, chain of thought (CoT) prompting. Our results highlight three key findings: (1) current LLMs underperform supervised PLMs based sarcasm detection baselines across six sarcasm benchmarks. This suggests that significant efforts are still required to improve LLMs' understanding of human sarcasm. (2) GPT-4 consistently and significantly outperforms other LLMs across various prompting methods, with an average improvement of 14.0\%$\uparrow$. Claude 3 and ChatGPT demonstrate the next best performance after GPT-4. (3) Few-shot IO prompting method outperforms the other two methods: zero-shot IO and few-shot CoT. The reason is that sarcasm detection, being a holistic, intuitive, and non-rational cognitive process, is argued not to adhere to step-by-step logical reasoning, making CoT less effective in understanding sarcasm compared to its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11319v2,2024-08
EEG-Defender: Defending against Jailbreak through Early Exit Generation of Large Language Models,"Chongwen Zhao, Zhihao Dou, Kaizhu Huang","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation. In an effort to mitigate such risks, the concept of ""Alignment"" technology has been developed. However, recent studies indicate that this alignment can be undermined using sophisticated prompt engineering or adversarial suffixes, a technique known as ""Jailbreak."" Our research takes cues from the human-like generate process of LLMs. We identify that while jailbreaking prompts may yield output logits similar to benign prompts, their initial embeddings within the model's latent space tend to be more analogous to those of malicious prompts. Leveraging this finding, we propose utilizing the early transformer outputs of LLMs as a means to detect malicious inputs, and terminate the generation immediately. Built upon this idea, we introduce a simple yet significant defense approach called EEG-Defender for LLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ten jailbreak methods across three models. Our results demonstrate that EEG-Defender is capable of reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by a significant margin, roughly 85\% in comparison with 50\% for the present SOTAs, with minimal impact on the utility and effectiveness of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11308v1,2024-08
RePair: Automated Program Repair with Process-based Feedback,"Yuze Zhao, Zhenya Huang, Yixiao Ma, Rui Li, Kai Zhang, Hao Jiang, Qi Liu, Linbo Zhu, Yu Su","The gap between the trepidation of program reliability and the expense of repairs underscores the indispensability of Automated Program Repair (APR). APR is instrumental in transforming vulnerable programs into more robust ones, bolstering program reliability while simultaneously diminishing the financial burden of manual repairs. Commercial-scale language models (LM) have taken APR to unprecedented levels. However, the emergence reveals that for models fewer than 100B parameters, making single-step modifications may be difficult to achieve the desired effect. Moreover, humans interact with the LM through explicit prompts, which hinders the LM from receiving feedback from compiler and test cases to automatically optimize its repair policies. In this literature, we explore how small-scale LM (less than 20B) achieve excellent performance through process supervision and feedback. We start by constructing a dataset named CodeNet4Repair, replete with multiple repair records, which supervises the fine-tuning of a foundational model. Building upon the encouraging outcomes of reinforcement learning, we develop a reward model that serves as a critic, providing feedback for the fine-tuned LM's action, progressively optimizing its policy. During inference, we require the LM to generate solutions iteratively until the repair effect no longer improves or hits the maximum step limit. The results show that process-based not only outperforms larger outcome-based generation methods, but also nearly matches the performance of closed-source commercial large-scale LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11296v1,2024-08
RedWhale: An Adapted Korean LLM Through Efficient Continual Pretraining,"Anh-Dung Vo, Minseong Jung, Wonbeen Lee, Daewoo Choi","The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, much of this research remains focused on English, often overlooking low-resource languages like Korean. This oversight presents challenges due to the unique non-alphabetic token structure of Korean and the substantial memory and computational demands required for LLM training, which frequently lead to memory constraints and out-of-memory errors. To address these issues, we present RedWhale, a model specifically tailored for Korean language processing. RedWhale is developed using an efficient continual pretraining approach that includes a comprehensive Korean corpus preprocessing pipeline, a specialized tokenizer, an optimized model initialization technique, and a multistage pretraining strategy. These innovations collectively reduce training time and computational costs while maintaining high levels of accuracy and comprehension. By leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning, which exploits shared linguistic similarities across languages, RedWhale builds on English models to enhance Korean language processing. Experimental results demonstrate that RedWhale outperforms other leading models on Korean NLP benchmarks, including the Korean Balanced Evaluation of Significant Tasks (KoBEST), showing superior understanding and generation of Korean text. Furthermore, RedWhale showed no signs of convergence even after pretraining on 9.7 billion tokens, indicating the potential for further improvements with additional training. This work represents a significant advancement in bridging the linguistic divide, particularly in enhancing NLP capabilities for the Korean language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11294v1,2024-08
Towards Analyzing and Mitigating Sycophancy in Large Vision-Language Models,"Yunpu Zhao, Rui Zhang, Junbin Xiao, Changxin Ke, Ruibo Hou, Yifan Hao, Qi Guo, Yunji Chen","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown significant capability in vision-language understanding. However, one critical issue that persists in these models is sycophancy, which means models are unduly influenced by leading or deceptive prompts, resulting in biased outputs and hallucinations. Despite the progress in LVLMs, evaluating and mitigating sycophancy is yet much under-explored. In this work, we fill this gap by systematically analyzing sycophancy on various VL benchmarks with curated leading queries and further proposing a text contrastive decoding method for mitigation. While the specific sycophantic behavior varies significantly among models, our analysis reveals the severe deficiency of all LVLMs in resilience of sycophancy across various tasks. For improvement, we propose Leading Query Contrastive Decoding (LQCD), a model-agnostic method focusing on calibrating the LVLMs' over-reliance on leading cues by identifying and suppressing the probabilities of sycophancy tokens at the decoding stage. Extensive experiments show that LQCD effectively mitigate sycophancy, outperforming both prompt engineering methods and common methods for hallucination mitigation. We further demonstrate that LQCD does not hurt but even slightly improves LVLMs' responses to neutral queries, suggesting it being a more effective strategy for general-purpose decoding but not limited to sycophancy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11261v1,2024-08
Improving Speech Recognition Error Prediction for Modern and Off-the-shelf Speech Recognizers,"Prashant Serai, Peidong Wang, Eric Fosler-Lussier","Modeling the errors of a speech recognizer can help simulate errorful recognized speech data from plain text, which has proven useful for tasks like discriminative language modeling, improving robustness of NLP systems, where limited or even no audio data is available at train time. Previous work typically considered replicating behavior of GMM-HMM based systems, but the behavior of more modern posterior-based neural network acoustic models is not the same and requires adjustments to the error prediction model. In this work, we extend a prior phonetic confusion based model for predicting speech recognition errors in two ways: first, we introduce a sampling-based paradigm that better simulates the behavior of a posterior-based acoustic model. Second, we investigate replacing the confusion matrix with a sequence-to-sequence model in order to introduce context dependency into the prediction. We evaluate the error predictors in two ways: first by predicting the errors made by a Switchboard ASR system on unseen data (Fisher), and then using that same predictor to estimate the behavior of an unrelated cloud-based ASR system on a novel task. Sampling greatly improves predictive accuracy within a 100-guess paradigm, while the sequence model performs similarly to the confusion matrix.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11258v1,2024-08
Counterfactuals As a Means for Evaluating Faithfulness of Attribution Methods in Autoregressive Language Models,"Sepehr Kamahi, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh","Despite the widespread adoption of autoregressive language models, explainability evaluation research has predominantly focused on span infilling and masked language models. Evaluating the faithfulness of an explanation method -- how accurately it explains the inner workings and decision-making of the model -- is challenging because it is difficult to separate the model from its explanation. Most faithfulness evaluation techniques corrupt or remove input tokens deemed important by a particular attribution (feature importance) method and observe the resulting change in the model's output. However, for autoregressive language models, this approach creates out-of-distribution inputs due to their next-token prediction training objective. In this study, we propose a technique that leverages counterfactual generation to evaluate the faithfulness of attribution methods for autoregressive language models. Our technique generates fluent, in-distribution counterfactuals, making the evaluation protocol more reliable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11252v3,2024-08
Unboxing Occupational Bias: Grounded Debiasing of LLMs with U.S. Labor Data,"Atmika Gorti, Manas Gaur, Aman Chadha","Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to inheriting and amplifying societal biases embedded within their training data, potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes related to gender, occupation, and other sensitive categories. This issue becomes particularly problematic as biased LLMs can have far-reaching consequences, leading to unfair practices and exacerbating social inequalities across various domains, such as recruitment, online content moderation, or even the criminal justice system. Although prior research has focused on detecting bias in LLMs using specialized datasets designed to highlight intrinsic biases, there has been a notable lack of investigation into how these findings correlate with authoritative datasets, such as those from the U.S. National Bureau of Labor Statistics (NBLS). To address this gap, we conduct empirical research that evaluates LLMs in a ``bias-out-of-the-box"" setting, analyzing how the generated outputs compare with the distributions found in NBLS data. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward yet effective debiasing mechanism that directly incorporates NBLS instances to mitigate bias within LLMs. Our study spans seven different LLMs, including instructable, base, and mixture-of-expert models, and reveals significant levels of bias that are often overlooked by existing bias detection techniques. Importantly, our debiasing method, which does not rely on external datasets, demonstrates a substantial reduction in bias scores, highlighting the efficacy of our approach in creating fairer and more reliable LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11247v2,2024-08

Performance is on par with the largest and most advanced LLMs currently available, but requiring orders of magnitude fewer computational resources and not requiring labeled data. This approach involves translating class labels into a semantically rich description, spontaneous symmetry breaking of multilayer perceptron probes for unsupervised learning and inference, training probes to generate confidence scores (prior probabilities) from hidden state activations subject to known constraints via entropy maximization, and selecting the most confident probe model from an ensemble for prediction. These techniques are evaluated on four datasets using five base LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11239v1,2024-08
Out-of-Distribution Detection with Attention Head Masking for Multimodal Document Classification,"Christos Constantinou, Georgios Ioannides, Aman Chadha, Aaron Elkins, Edwin Simpson","Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial in machine learning applications to mitigate the risk of model overconfidence, thereby enhancing the reliability and safety of deployed systems. The majority of existing OOD detection methods predominantly address uni-modal inputs, such as images or texts. In the context of multi-modal documents, there is a notable lack of extensive research on the performance of these methods, which have primarily been developed with a focus on computer vision tasks. We propose a novel methodology termed as attention head masking (AHM) for multi-modal OOD tasks in document classification systems. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed AHM method outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches and significantly decreases the false positive rate (FPR) compared to existing solutions up to 7.5\%. This methodology generalizes well to multi-modal data, such as documents, where visual and textual information are modeled under the same Transformer architecture.

CoDi: Conversational Distillation for Grounded Question Answering,"Patrick Huber, Arash Einolghozati, Rylan Conway, Kanika Narang, Matt Smith, Waqar Nayyar, Adithya Sagar, Ahmed Aly, Akshat Shrivastava","Distilling conversational skills into Small Language Models (SLMs) with approximately 1 billion parameters presents significant challenges. Firstly, SLMs have limited capacity in their model parameters to learn extensive knowledge compared to larger models. Secondly, high-quality conversational datasets are often scarce, small, and domain-specific. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel data distillation framework named CoDi (short for Conversational Distillation, pronounced ""Cody""), allowing us to synthesize large-scale, assistant-style datasets in a steerable and diverse manner. Specifically, while our framework is task agnostic at its core, we explore and evaluate the potential of CoDi on the task of conversational grounded reasoning for question answering. This is a typical on-device scenario for specialist SLMs, allowing for open-domain model responses, without requiring the model to ""memorize"" world knowledge in its limited weights. Our evaluations show that SLMs trained with CoDi-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to models trained on human-annotated data in standard metrics. Additionally, when using our framework to generate larger datasets from web data, our models surpass larger, instruction-tuned models in zero-shot conversational grounded reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11219v1,2024-08
DSP-MLIR: A MLIR Dialect for Digital Signal Processing,"Abhinav Kumar, Atharva Khedkar, Aviral Shrivastava","Traditional Digital Signal Processing ( DSP ) compilers work at low level ( C-level / assembly level ) and hence lose much of the optimization opportunities present at high-level ( domain-level ). The emerging multi-level compiler infrastructure MLIR ( Multi-level Intermediate Representation ) allows to specify optimizations at higher level. In this paper, we utilize MLIR framework to introduce a DSP Dialect and perform domain-specific optimizations at dialect -level ( high-level ) and show the usefulness of these optimizations on sample DSP apps. In particular, we develop a compiler for DSP and a DSL (Domain Specific Language) to ease the development of apps. We show the performance improvement in execution time for these sample apps by upto 10x which would have been difficult if the IR were at C/ affine level.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11205v1,2024-08
Reading with Intent,"Benjamin Reichman, Kartik Talamadupula, Toshish Jawale, Larry Heck","Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems augment how knowledge language models are by integrating external information sources such as Wikipedia, internal documents, scientific papers, or the open internet. RAG systems that rely on the open internet as their knowledge source have to contend with the complexities of human-generated content. Human communication extends much deeper than just the words rendered as text. Intent, tonality, and connotation can all change the meaning of what is being conveyed. Recent real-world deployments of RAG systems have shown some difficulty in understanding these nuances of human communication. One significant challenge for these systems lies in processing sarcasm. Though the Large Language Models (LLMs) that make up the backbone of these RAG systems are able to detect sarcasm, they currently do not always use these detections for the subsequent processing of text. To address these issues, in this paper, we synthetically generate sarcastic passages from Natural Question's Wikipedia retrieval corpus. We then test the impact of these passages on the performance of both the retriever and reader portion of the RAG pipeline. We introduce a prompting system designed to enhance the model's ability to interpret and generate responses in the presence of sarcasm, thus improving overall system performance. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improvements in handling sarcastic content within RAG systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11189v1,2024-08
Combining Objective and Subjective Perspectives for Political News Understanding,"Evan Dufraisse, Adrian Popescu, Julien Tourille, Armelle Brun, Olivier Hamon","Researchers and practitioners interested in computational politics rely on automatic content analysis tools to make sense of the large amount of political texts available on the Web. Such tools should provide objective and subjective aspects at different granularity levels to make the analyses useful in practice. Existing methods produce interesting insights for objective aspects, but are limited for subjective ones, are often limited to national contexts, and have limited explainability. We introduce a text analysis framework which integrates both perspectives and provides a fine-grained processing of subjective aspects. Information retrieval techniques and knowledge bases complement powerful natural language processing components to allow a flexible aggregation of results at different granularity levels. Importantly, the proposed bottom-up approach facilitates the explainability of the obtained results. We illustrate its functioning with insights on news outlets, political orientations, topics, individual entities, and demographic segments. The approach is instantiated on a large corpus of French news, but is designed to work seamlessly for other languages and countries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11174v1,2024-08
SubgoalXL: Subgoal-based Expert Learning for Theorem Proving,"Xueliang Zhao, Lin Zheng, Haige Bo, Changran Hu, Urmish Thakker, Lingpeng Kong","Formal theorem proving, a field at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, has seen renewed interest with advancements in large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces SubgoalXL, a novel approach that synergizes subgoal-based proofs with expert learning to enhance LLMs' capabilities in formal theorem proving within the Isabelle environment. SubgoalXL addresses two critical challenges: the scarcity of specialized mathematics and theorem-proving data, and the need for improved multi-step reasoning abilities in LLMs. By optimizing data efficiency and employing subgoal-level supervision, SubgoalXL extracts richer information from limited human-generated proofs. The framework integrates subgoal-oriented proof strategies with an expert learning system, iteratively refining formal statement, proof, and subgoal generators. Leveraging the Isabelle environment's advantages in subgoal-based proofs, SubgoalXL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 56.1\% in Isabelle on the standard miniF2F dataset, marking an absolute improvement of 4.9\%. Notably, SubgoalXL successfully solves 41 AMC12, 9 AIME, and 3 IMO problems from miniF2F. These results underscore the effectiveness of maximizing limited data utility and employing targeted guidance for complex reasoning in formal theorem proving, contributing to the ongoing advancement of AI reasoning capabilities.

Public Health in Disaster: Emotional Health and Life Incidents Extraction during Hurricane Harvey,"Thomas Hoang, Quynh Anh Nguyen, Long Nguyen","Countless disasters have resulted from climate change, causing severe damage to infrastructure and the economy. These disasters have significant societal impacts, necessitating mental health services for the millions affected. To prepare for and respond effectively to such events, it is important to understand people's emotions and the life incidents they experience before and after a disaster strikes. In this case study, we collected a dataset of approximately 400,000 public tweets related to the storm. Using a BERT-based model, we predicted the emotions associated with each tweet. To efficiently identify these topics, we utilized the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique for topic modeling, which allowed us to bypass manual content analysis and extract meaningful patterns from the data. However, rather than stopping at topic identification like previous methods \cite{math11244910}, we further refined our analysis by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Large Language Models (LLM). The GNN was employed to generate embeddings and construct a similarity graph of the tweets, which was then used to optimize clustering. Subsequently, we used an LLM to automatically generate descriptive names for each event cluster, offering critical insights for disaster preparedness and response strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11133v1,2024-08
DOMBA: Double Model Balancing for Access-Controlled Language Models via Minimum-Bounded Aggregation,"Tom Segal, Asaf Shabtai, Yuval Elovici","The utility of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on the quality and quantity of their training data. Many organizations possess large data corpora that could be leveraged to train or fine-tune LLMs tailored to their specific needs. However, these datasets often come with access restrictions that are based on user privileges and enforced by access control mechanisms. Training LLMs on such datasets could result in exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users. A straightforward approach for preventing such exposure is to train a separate model for each access level. This, however, may result in low utility models due to the limited amount of training data per model compared to the amount in the entire organizational corpus. Another approach is to train a single LLM on all the data while limiting the exposure of unauthorized information. However, current exposure-limiting methods for LLMs are ineffective for access-controlled data, where sensitive information appears frequently across many training examples. We propose DOMBA - double model balancing - a simple approach for training and deploying LLMs that provides high utility and access-control functionality with security guarantees. DOMBA aggregates the probability distributions of two models, each trained on documents with (potentially many) different access levels, using a ""min-bounded"" average function (a function that is bounded by the smaller value, e.g., harmonic mean). A detailed mathematical analysis and extensive evaluation show that DOMBA safeguards restricted information while offering utility comparable to non-secure models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11121v1,2024-08
Mistral-SPLADE: LLMs for better Learned Sparse Retrieval,"Meet Doshi, Vishwajeet Kumar, Rudra Murthy, Vignesh P, Jaydeep Sen","Learned Sparse Retrievers (LSR) have evolved into an effective retrieval strategy that can bridge the gap between traditional keyword-based sparse retrievers and embedding-based dense retrievers. At its core, learned sparse retrievers try to learn the most important semantic keyword expansions from a query and/or document which can facilitate better retrieval with overlapping keyword expansions. LSR like SPLADE has typically been using encoder only models with MLM (masked language modeling) style objective in conjunction with known ways of retrieval performance improvement such as hard negative mining, distillation, etc. In this work, we propose to use decoder-only model for learning semantic keyword expansion. We posit, decoder only models that have seen much higher magnitudes of data are better equipped to learn keyword expansions needed for improved retrieval. We use Mistral as the backbone to develop our Learned Sparse Retriever similar to SPLADE and train it on a subset of sentence-transformer data which is often used for training text embedding models. Our experiments support the hypothesis that a sparse retrieval model based on decoder only large language model (LLM) surpasses the performance of existing LSR systems, including SPLADE and all its variants. The LLM based model (Echo-Mistral-SPLADE) now stands as a state-of-the-art learned sparse retrieval model on the BEIR text retrieval benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11119v2,2024-08
FLAME: Learning to Navigate with Multimodal LLM in Urban Environments,"Yunzhe Xu, Yiyuan Pan, Zhe Liu, Hesheng Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, yet current applications face challenges. While LLMs excel in general conversation scenarios, they struggle with specialized navigation tasks, yielding suboptimal performance compared to specialized VLN models. We introduce FLAME (FLAMingo-Architected Embodied Agent), a novel Multimodal LLM-based agent and architecture designed for urban VLN tasks that efficiently handles multiple observations. Our approach implements a three-phase tuning technique for effective adaptation to navigation tasks, including single perception tuning for street view description, multiple perception tuning for trajectory summarization, and end-to-end training on VLN datasets. The augmented datasets are synthesized automatically. Experimental results demonstrate FLAME's superiority over existing methods, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a 7.3% increase in task completion rate on Touchdown dataset.

MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context Generation with Speculative Decoding,"Jian Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zhuoming Chen, Jinyuan Shi, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Beidi Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size. This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x speedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

Inside the Black Box: Detecting Data Leakage in Pre-trained Language Encoders,"Yuan Xin, Zheng Li, Ning Yu, Dingfan Chen, Mario Fritz, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang","Despite being prevalent in the general field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), pre-trained language models inherently carry privacy and copyright concerns due to their nature of training on large-scale web-scraped data. In this paper, we pioneer a systematic exploration of such risks associated with pre-trained language encoders, specifically focusing on the membership leakage of pre-training data exposed through downstream models adapted from pre-trained language encoders-an aspect largely overlooked in existing literature. Our study encompasses comprehensive experiments across four types of pre-trained encoder architectures, three representative downstream tasks, and five benchmark datasets. Intriguingly, our evaluations reveal, for the first time, the existence of membership leakage even when only the black-box output of the downstream model is exposed, highlighting a privacy risk far greater than previously assumed. Alongside, we present in-depth analysis and insights toward guiding future researchers and practitioners in addressing the privacy considerations in developing pre-trained language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11046v1,2024-08
Beyond Labels: Aligning Large Language Models with Human-like Reasoning,"Muhammad Rafsan Kabir, Rafeed Mohammad Sultan, Ihsanul Haque Asif, Jawad Ibn Ahad, Fuad Rahman, Mohammad Ruhul Amin, Nabeel Mohammed, Shafin Rahman","Aligning large language models (LLMs) with a human reasoning approach ensures that LLMs produce morally correct and human-like decisions. Ethical concerns are raised because current models are prone to generating false positives and providing malicious responses. To contribute to this issue, we have curated an ethics dataset named Dataset for Aligning Reasons (DFAR), designed to aid in aligning language models to generate human-like reasons. The dataset comprises statements with ethical-unethical labels and their corresponding reasons. In this study, we employed a unique and novel fine-tuning approach that utilizes ethics labels and their corresponding reasons (L+R), in contrast to the existing fine-tuning approach that only uses labels (L). The original pre-trained versions, the existing fine-tuned versions, and our proposed fine-tuned versions of LLMs were then evaluated on an ethical-unethical classification task and a reason-generation task. Our proposed fine-tuning strategy notably outperforms the others in both tasks, achieving significantly higher accuracy scores in the classification task and lower misalignment rates in the reason-generation task. The increase in classification accuracies and decrease in misalignment rates indicate that the L+R fine-tuned models align more with human ethics. Hence, this study illustrates that injecting reasons has substantially improved the alignment of LLMs, resulting in more human-like responses. We have made the DFAR dataset and corresponding codes publicly available at https://github.com/apurba-nsu-rnd-lab/DFAR.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11879v1,2024-08
Scaling Law with Learning Rate Annealing,"Howe Tissue, Venus Wang, Lu Wang","We find that the cross-entropy loss curves of neural language models empirically adhere to a scaling law with learning rate (LR) annealing over training steps: $$L(s) = L_0 + A\cdot S_1^{-\alpha} - C\cdot S_2,$$ where $L(s)$ is the validation loss at step $s$, $S_1$ is the area under the LR curve, $S_2$ is the LR annealing area, and $L_0$, $A$, $C$, $\alpha$ are constant parameters. This formulation takes into account two factors: (1) power-law scaling over data size, and (2) the additional loss reduction during LR annealing. Therefore, this formulation can describe the full loss curve at each step, rather than the single loss point at the end of training. Applying the scaling law with LR annealing and fitting only one or two training curves, we can accurately predict the loss at any given step across any learning rate scheduler (LRS). This approach significantly reduces computational cost in formulating scaling laws while providing more accuracy and expressiveness for training dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our findings hold across a range of hyper-parameters and model architectures, and our equation can extend to scaling effect of model sizes. Moreover, our formulation provides accurate theoretical verification and explanation for empirical results observed in numerous previous studies, particularly those focusing on LR schedule and annealing. We believe that this work is promising to enhance the understanding of LLM training dynamics while greatly democratizing scaling laws, and it can guide researchers in refining training strategies (e.g. critical LRS) for further LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11029v2,2024-08
Athena: Safe Autonomous Agents with Verbal Contrastive Learning,"Tanmana Sadhu, Ali Pesaranghader, Yanan Chen, Dong Hoon Yi","Due to emergent capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been utilized as language-based agents to perform a variety of tasks and make decisions with an increasing degree of autonomy. These autonomous agents can understand high-level instructions, interact with their environments, and execute complex tasks using a selection of tools available to them. As the capabilities of the agents expand, ensuring their safety and trustworthiness becomes more imperative. In this study, we introduce the Athena framework which leverages the concept of verbal contrastive learning where past safe and unsafe trajectories are used as in-context (contrastive) examples to guide the agent towards safety while fulfilling a given task. The framework also incorporates a critiquing mechanism to guide the agent to prevent risky actions at every step. Furthermore, due to the lack of existing benchmarks on the safety reasoning ability of LLM-based agents, we curate a set of 80 toolkits across 8 categories with 180 scenarios to provide a safety evaluation benchmark. Our experimental evaluation, with both closed- and open-source LLMs, indicates verbal contrastive learning and interaction-level critiquing improve the safety rate significantly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11021v1,2024-08
Security Attacks on LLM-based Code Completion Tools,"Wen Cheng, Ke Sun, Xinyu Zhang, Wei Wang","The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs). Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges. Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data. This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks. Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q. Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames. Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs. These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks.

Disentangling segmental and prosodic factors to non-native speech comprehensibility,"Waris Quamer, Ricardo Gutierrez-Osuna","Current accent conversion (AC) systems do not disentangle the two main sources of non-native accent: segmental and prosodic characteristics. Being able to manipulate a non-native speaker's segmental and/or prosodic channels independently is critical to quantify how these two channels contribute to speech comprehensibility and social attitudes. We present an AC system that not only decouples voice quality from accent, but also disentangles the latter into its segmental and prosodic characteristics. The system is able to generate accent conversions that combine (1) the segmental characteristics from a source utterance, (2) the voice characteristics from a target utterance, and (3) the prosody of a reference utterance. We show that vector quantization of acoustic embeddings and removal of consecutive duplicated codewords allows the system to transfer prosody and improve voice similarity. We conduct perceptual listening tests to quantify the individual contributions of segmental features and prosody on the perceived comprehensibility of non-native speech. Our results indicate that, contrary to prior research in non-native speech, segmental features have a larger impact on comprehensibility than prosody. The proposed AC system may also be used to study how segmental and prosody cues affect social attitudes towards non-native speech.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10997v1,2024-08
CTP-LLM: Clinical Trial Phase Transition Prediction Using Large Language Models,"Michael Reinisch, Jianfeng He, Chenxi Liao, Sauleh Ahmad Siddiqui, Bei Xiao","New medical treatment development requires multiple phases of clinical trials. Despite the significant human and financial costs of bringing a drug to market, less than 20% of drugs in testing will make it from the first phase to final approval. Recent literature indicates that the design of the trial protocols significantly contributes to trial performance. We investigated Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction (CTOP) using trial design documents to predict phase transitions automatically. We propose CTP-LLM, the first Large Language Model (LLM) based model for CTOP. We also introduce the PhaseTransition (PT) Dataset; which labels trials based on their progression through the regulatory process and serves as a benchmark for CTOP evaluation. Our fine-tuned GPT-3.5-based model (CTP-LLM) predicts clinical trial phase transition by analyzing the trial's original protocol texts without requiring human-selected features. CTP-LLM achieves a 67% accuracy rate in predicting trial phase transitions across all phases and a 75% accuracy rate specifically in predicting the transition from Phase~III to final approval.

Automating Knowledge Discovery from Scientific Literature via LLMs: A Dual-Agent Approach with Progressive Ontology Prompting,"Yuting Hu, Dancheng Liu, Qingyun Wang, Charles Yu, Heng Ji, Jinjun Xiong","To address the challenge of automating knowledge discovery from a vast volume of literature, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that combines a progressive ontology prompting (POP) algorithm with a dual-agent system, named LLM-Duo, designed to enhance the automation of knowledge extraction from scientific articles. The POP algorithm utilizes a prioritized breadth-first search (BFS) across a predefined ontology to generate structured prompt templates and action orders, thereby guiding LLMs to discover knowledge in an automatic manner. Additionally, our LLM-Duo employs two specialized LLM agents: an explorer and an evaluator. These two agents work collaboratively and adversarially to enhance the reliability of the discovery and annotation processes. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms advanced baselines, enabling more accurate and complete annotations. To validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios, we employ our method in a case study of speech-language intervention discovery.

Dr.Academy: A Benchmark for Evaluating Questioning Capability in Education for Large Language Models,"Yuyan Chen, Chenwei Wu, Songzhou Yan, Panjun Liu, Haoyu Zhou, Yanghua Xiao","Teachers are important to imparting knowledge and guiding learners, and the role of large language models (LLMs) as potential educators is emerging as an important area of study. Recognizing LLMs' capability to generate educational content can lead to advances in automated and personalized learning. While LLMs have been tested for their comprehension and problem-solving skills, their capability in teaching remains largely unexplored. In teaching, questioning is a key skill that guides students to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize core concepts and principles. Therefore, our research introduces a benchmark to evaluate the questioning capability in education as a teacher of LLMs through evaluating their generated educational questions, utilizing Anderson and Krathwohl's taxonomy across general, monodisciplinary, and interdisciplinary domains. We shift the focus from LLMs as learners to LLMs as educators, assessing their teaching capability through guiding them to generate questions. We apply four metrics, including relevance, coverage, representativeness, and consistency, to evaluate the educational quality of LLMs' outputs. Our results indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates significant potential in teaching general, humanities, and science courses; Claude2 appears more apt as an interdisciplinary teacher.

SysBench: Can Large Language Models Follow System Messages?,"Yanzhao Qin, Tao Zhang, Tao Zhang, Yanjun Shen, Wenjing Luo, Haoze Sun, Yan Zhang, Yujing Qiao, Weipeng Chen, Zenan Zhou, Wentao Zhang, Bin Cui","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become instrumental across various applications, with the customization of these models to specific scenarios becoming increasingly critical. System message, a fundamental component of LLMs, is consist of carefully crafted instructions that guide the behavior of model to meet intended goals. Despite the recognized potential of system messages to optimize AI-driven solutions, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how well LLMs follow system messages. To fill this gap, we introduce SysBench, a benchmark that systematically analyzes system message following ability in terms of three limitations of existing LLMs: constraint violation, instruction misjudgement and multi-turn instability. Specifically, we manually construct evaluation dataset based on six prevalent types of constraints, including 500 tailor-designed system messages and multi-turn user conversations covering various interaction relationships. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation protocol to measure model performance. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluation across various existing LLMs, measuring their ability to follow specified constraints given in system messages.

LBC: Language-Based-Classifier for Out-Of-Variable Generalization,"Kangjun Noh, Baekryun Seong, Hoyoon Byun, Youngjun Choi, Sungjin Song, Kyungwoo Song","Large Language Models (LLMs) have great success in natural language processing tasks such as response generation. However, their use in tabular data has been limited due to their inferior performance compared to traditional machine learning models (TMLs) such as XGBoost. We find that the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs enables them to interpret new variables that appear in a test without additional training, a capability central to the concept of Out-of-Variable (OOV). From the findings, we propose a Language-Based-Classifier (LBC), a classifier that maximizes the benefits of LLMs to outperform TMLs on OOV tasks. LBC employs three key methodological strategies: 1) Categorical changes to adjust data to better fit the model's understanding, 2) Advanced order and indicator to enhance data representation to the model, and 3) Using verbalizer to map logit scores to classes during inference to generate model predictions. These strategies, combined with the pre-trained knowledge of LBC, emphasize the model's ability to effectively handle OOV tasks. We empirically and theoretically validate the superiority of LBC.

However, recent fact verification benchmarks mainly focus on checking a narrow scope of semantic factoids within claims and lack an explicit logical reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce CheckWhy, a challenging dataset tailored to a novel causal fact verification task: checking the truthfulness of the causal relation within claims through rigorous reasoning steps. CheckWhy consists of over 19K ""why"" claim-evidence-argument structure triplets with supports, refutes, and not enough info labels. Each argument structure is composed of connected evidence, representing the reasoning process that begins with foundational evidence and progresses toward claim establishment. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we validate the importance of incorporating the argument structure for causal fact verification. Moreover, the automated and human evaluation of argument structure generation reveals the difficulty in producing satisfying argument structure by fine-tuned models or Chain-of-Thought prompted LLMs, leaving considerable room for future improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10918v2,2024-08
"To Code, or Not To Code? Exploring Impact of Code in Pre-training","Viraat Aryabumi, Yixuan Su, Raymond Ma, Adrien Morisot, Ivan Zhang, Acyr Locatelli, Marzieh Fadaee, Ahmet Üstün, Sara Hooker","Including code in the pre-training data mixture, even for models not specifically designed for code, has become a common practice in LLMs pre-training. While there has been anecdotal consensus among practitioners that code data plays a vital role in general LLMs' performance, there is only limited work analyzing the precise impact of code on non-code tasks. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of code data on general performance. We ask ""what is the impact of code data used in pre-training on a large variety of downstream tasks beyond code generation"". We conduct extensive ablations and evaluate across a broad range of natural language reasoning tasks, world knowledge tasks, code benchmarks, and LLM-as-a-judge win-rates for models with sizes ranging from 470M to 2.8B parameters. Across settings, we find a consistent results that code is a critical building block for generalization far beyond coding tasks and improvements to code quality have an outsized impact across all tasks. In particular, compared to text-only pre-training, the addition of code results in up to relative increase of 8.2% in natural language (NL) reasoning, 4.2% in world knowledge, 6.6% improvement in generative win-rates, and a 12x boost in code performance respectively. Our work suggests investments in code quality and preserving code during pre-training have positive impacts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10914v1,2024-08
BEYOND DIALOGUE: A Profile-Dialogue Alignment Framework Towards General Role-Playing Language Model,"Yeyong Yu, Runsheng Yu, Haojie Wei, Zhanqiu Zhang, Quan Qian","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized role-playing, enabling the development of general role-playing models. However, current role-playing training has two significant issues: (I) Using a predefined role profile to prompt dialogue training for specific scenarios usually leads to inconsistencies and even conflicts between the dialogue and the profile, resulting in training biases. (II) The model learns to imitate the role based solely on the profile, neglecting profile-dialogue alignment at the sentence level. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework called BEYOND DIALOGUE, designed to overcome these hurdles. This framework innovatively introduces ""beyond dialogue"" tasks to align dialogue with profile traits based on each specific scenario, thereby eliminating biases during training. Furthermore, by adopting an innovative prompting mechanism that generates reasoning outcomes for training, the framework allows the model to achieve fine-grained alignment between profile and dialogue at the sentence level. The aforementioned methods are fully automated and low-cost. Additionally, the integration of automated dialogue and objective evaluation methods forms a comprehensive framework, paving the way for general role-playing. Experimental results demonstrate that our model excels in adhering to and reflecting various dimensions of role profiles, outperforming most proprietary general and specialized role-playing baselines. All code and datasets are available at https://github.com/yuyouyu32/BeyondDialogue.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10903v5,2024-08
Soda-Eval: Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation in the age of LLMs,"John Mendonça, Isabel Trancoso, Alon Lavie","Although human evaluation remains the gold standard for open-domain dialogue evaluation, the growing popularity of automated evaluation using Large Language Models (LLMs) has also extended to dialogue. However, most frameworks leverage benchmarks that assess older chatbots on aspects such as fluency and relevance, which are not reflective of the challenges associated with contemporary models. In fact, a qualitative analysis on Soda, a GPT-3.5 generated dialogue dataset, suggests that current chatbots may exhibit several recurring issues related to coherence and commonsense knowledge, but generally produce highly fluent and relevant responses.   Noting the aforementioned limitations, this paper introduces Soda-Eval, an annotated dataset based on Soda that covers over 120K turn-level assessments across 10K dialogues, where the annotations were generated by GPT-4. Using Soda-Eval as a benchmark, we then study the performance of several open-access instruction-tuned LLMs, finding that dialogue evaluation remains challenging. Fine-tuning these models improves performance over few-shot inferences, both in terms of correlation and explanation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10902v3,2024-08
Benchmarking Large Language Models for Math Reasoning Tasks,"Kathrin Seßler, Yao Rong, Emek Gözlüklü, Enkelejda Kasneci","The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning has become a cornerstone of related research, demonstrating the intelligence of these models and enabling potential practical applications through their advanced performance, such as in educational settings. Despite the variety of datasets and in-context learning algorithms designed to improve the ability of LLMs to automate mathematical problem solving, the lack of comprehensive benchmarking across different datasets makes it complicated to select an appropriate model for specific tasks. In this project, we present a benchmark that fairly compares seven state-of-the-art in-context learning algorithms for mathematical problem solving across five widely used mathematical datasets on four powerful foundation models. Furthermore, we explore the trade-off between efficiency and performance, highlighting the practical applications of LLMs for mathematical reasoning. Our results indicate that larger foundation models like GPT-4o and LLaMA 3-70B can solve mathematical reasoning independently from the concrete prompting strategy, while for smaller models the in-context learning approach significantly influences the performance. Moreover, the optimal prompt depends on the chosen foundation model. We open-source our benchmark code to support the integration of additional models in future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10839v2,2024-08
GS-KGC: A Generative Subgraph-based Framework for Knowledge Graph Completion with Large Language Models,"Rui Yang, Jiahao Zhu, Jianping Man, Hongze Liu, Li Fang, Yi Zhou","Knowledge graph completion (KGC) focuses on identifying missing triples in a knowledge graph (KG) , which is crucial for many downstream applications. Given the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), some LLM-based methods are proposed for KGC task. However, most of them focus on prompt engineering while overlooking the fact that finer-grained subgraph information can aid LLMs in generating more accurate answers. In this paper, we propose a novel completion framework called \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{S}ubgraph-based KGC (GS-KGC), which utilizes subgraph information as contextual reasoning and employs a QA approach to achieve the KGC task. This framework primarily includes a subgraph partitioning algorithm designed to generate negatives and neighbors. Specifically, negatives can encourage LLMs to generate a broader range of answers, while neighbors provide additional contextual insights for LLM reasoning. Furthermore, we found that GS-KGC can discover potential triples within the KGs and new facts beyond the KGs. Experiments conducted on four common KGC datasets highlight the advantages of the proposed GS-KGC, e.g., it shows a 5.6\% increase in Hits@3 compared to the LLM-based model CP-KGC on the FB15k-237N, and a 9.3\% increase over the LLM-based model TECHS on the ICEWS14.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10819v2,2024-08
Beyond English-Centric LLMs: What Language Do Multilingual Language Models Think in?,"Chengzhi Zhong, Fei Cheng, Qianying Liu, Junfeng Jiang, Zhen Wan, Chenhui Chu, Yugo Murawaki, Sadao Kurohashi","In this study, we investigate whether non-English-centric LLMs, despite their strong performance, `think' in their respective dominant language: more precisely, `think' refers to how the representations of intermediate layers, when un-embedded into the vocabulary space, exhibit higher probabilities for certain dominant languages during generation. We term such languages as internal $\textbf{latent languages}$.   We examine the latent language of three typical categories of models for Japanese processing: Llama2, an English-centric model; Swallow, an English-centric model with continued pre-training in Japanese; and LLM-jp, a model pre-trained on balanced English and Japanese corpora. Our empirical findings reveal that, unlike Llama2 which relies exclusively on English as the internal latent language, Japanese-specific Swallow and LLM-jp employ both Japanese and English, exhibiting dual internal latent languages. For any given target language, the model preferentially activates the latent language most closely related to it. In addition, we explore how intermediate layers respond to questions involving cultural conflicts between latent internal and target output languages. We further explore how the language identity shifts across layers while keeping consistent semantic meaning reflected in the intermediate layer representations.   This study deepens the understanding of non-English-centric large language models, highlighting the intricate dynamics of language representation within their intermediate layers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10811v1,2024-08

Adversarial Attack for Explanation Robustness of Rationalization Models,"Yuankai Zhang, Lingxiao Kong, Haozhao Wang, Ruixuan Li, Jun Wang, Yuhua Li, Wei Liu","Rationalization models, which select a subset of input text as rationale-crucial for humans to understand and trust predictions-have recently emerged as a prominent research area in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence. However, most of previous studies mainly focus on improving the quality of the rationale, ignoring its robustness to malicious attack. Specifically, whether the rationalization models can still generate high-quality rationale under the adversarial attack remains unknown. To explore this, this paper proposes UAT2E, which aims to undermine the explainability of rationalization models without altering their predictions, thereby eliciting distrust in these models from human users. UAT2E employs the gradient-based search on triggers and then inserts them into the original input to conduct both the non-target and target attack. Experimental results on five datasets reveal the vulnerability of rationalization models in terms of explanation, where they tend to select more meaningless tokens under attacks. Based on this, we make a series of recommendations for improving rationalization models in terms of explanation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10795v3,2024-08
Flexora: Flexible Low Rank Adaptation for Large Language Models,"Chenxing Wei, Yao Shu, Ying Tiffany He, Fei Richard Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10774v2,2024-08
Predicting Rewards Alongside Tokens: Non-disruptive Parameter Insertion for Efficient Inference Intervention in Large Language Model,"Chenhan Yuan, Fei Huang, Ru Peng, Keming Lu, Bowen Yu, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou","Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) exhibit limitations such as generating unsafe responses, unreliable reasoning, etc. Existing inference intervention approaches attempt to mitigate these issues by finetuning additional models to produce calibration signals (such as rewards) that guide the LLM's decoding process. However, this solution introduces substantial time and space overhead due to the separate models required. This work proposes Non-disruptive parameters insertion (Otter), inserting extra parameters into the transformer architecture to predict calibration signals along with the original LLM output. Otter offers state-of-the-art performance on multiple demanding tasks while saving up to 86.5\% extra space and 98.5\% extra time. Furthermore, Otter seamlessly integrates with existing inference engines, requiring only a one-line code change, and the original model response remains accessible after the parameter insertion.

What can Large Language Models Capture about Code Functional Equivalence?,"Nickil Maveli, Antonio Vergari, Shay B. Cohen","Code-LLMs, LLMs pre-trained on large code corpora, have shown great progress in learning rich representations of the structure and syntax of code, successfully using it to generate or classify code fragments. At the same time, understanding if they are able to do so because they capture code semantics, and how well, is still an open question. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing SeqCoBench, a benchmark for systematically assessing how Code-LLMs can capture code functional equivalence. SeqCoBench contains over 20 code transformations that either preserve or alter the semantics of Python programs. We conduct extensive evaluations in different settings, including zero-shot and parameter-efficient finetuning methods on state-of-the-art (Code-)LLMs to see if they can discern semantically equivalent or different pairs of programs in SeqCoBench. We find that the performance gap between these LLMs and classical match-based retrieval scores is minimal, with both approaches showing a concerning lack of depth in understanding code semantics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11081v1,2024-08
Towards Efficient Large Language Models for Scientific Text: A Review,"Huy Quoc To, Ming Liu, Guangyan Huang","Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for processing complex information in various fields, including science. The increasing amount of scientific literature allows these models to acquire and understand scientific knowledge effectively, thus improving their performance in a wide range of tasks.

Therefore, in recent years, researchers have proposed various methodologies to make scientific LLMs more affordable. The most well-known approaches align in two directions. It can be either focusing on the size of the models or enhancing the quality of data. To date, a comprehensive review of these two families of methods has not yet been undertaken.

MEGen: Generative Backdoor in Large Language Models via Model Editing,"Jiyang Qiu, Xinbei Ma, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. Their powerful generative abilities enable flexible responses based on various queries or instructions. Emerging as widely adopted generalists for diverse tasks, LLMs are still vulnerable to backdoors. This paper proposes an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to create a customized backdoor for NLP tasks with the least side effects. In our approach, we first leverage a language model to insert a trigger selected on fixed metrics into the input, then design a pipeline of model editing to directly embed a backdoor into an LLM. By adjusting a small set of local parameters with a mini-batch of samples, MEGen significantly enhances time efficiency and achieves high robustness. Experimental results indicate that our backdoor attack strategy achieves a high attack success rate on poison data while maintaining the model's performance on clean data. Notably, the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while successfully completing downstream tasks. This suggests that future LLM applications could be guided to deliver certain dangerous information, thus altering the LLM's generative style. We believe this approach provides insights for future LLM applications and the execution of backdoor attacks on conversational AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10722v1,2024-08

However, these benchmarks may not fully capture a model's code understanding abilities. We introduce CodeJudge-Eval (CJ-Eval), a novel benchmark designed to assess LLMs' code understanding abilities from the perspective of code judging rather than code generation. CJ-Eval challenges models to determine the correctness of provided code solutions, encompassing various error types and compilation issues. By leveraging a diverse set of problems and a fine-grained judging system, CJ-Eval addresses the limitations of traditional benchmarks, including the potential memorization of solutions. Evaluation of 12 well-known LLMs on CJ-Eval reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle, highlighting the benchmark's ability to probe deeper into models' code understanding abilities.

Ferret: Faster and Effective Automated Red Teaming with Reward-Based Scoring Technique,"Tej Deep Pala, Vernon Y. H. Toh, Rishabh Bhardwaj, Soujanya Poria","In today's era, where large language models (LLMs) are integrated into numerous real-world applications, ensuring their safety and robustness is crucial for responsible AI usage. Automated red-teaming methods play a key role in this process by generating adversarial attacks to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in these models. However, existing methods often struggle with slow performance, limited categorical diversity, and high resource demands. While Rainbow Teaming, a recent approach, addresses the diversity challenge by framing adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity search, it remains slow and requires a large fine-tuned mutator for optimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Ferret, a novel approach that builds upon Rainbow Teaming by generating multiple adversarial prompt mutations per iteration and using a scoring function to rank and select the most effective adversarial prompt. We explore various scoring functions, including reward models, Llama Guard, and LLM-as-a-judge, to rank adversarial mutations based on their potential harm to improve the efficiency of the search for harmful mutations. Our results demonstrate that Ferret, utilizing a reward model as a scoring function, improves the overall attack success rate (ASR) to 95%, which is 46% higher than Rainbow Teaming. Additionally, Ferret reduces the time needed to achieve a 90% ASR by 15.2% compared to the baseline and generates adversarial prompts that are transferable i.e. effective on other LLMs of larger size.

In this work, we address one of the challenges of UQ in generation tasks that arises from the conditional dependency between the generation steps of an LLM. We propose to learn this dependency from data. We train a regression model, which target variable is the gap between the conditional and the unconditional generation confidence. During LLM inference, we use this learned conditional dependency model to modulate the uncertainty of the current generation step based on the uncertainty of the previous step.

Towards Robust Knowledge Unlearning: An Adversarial Framework for Assessing and Improving Unlearning Robustness in Large Language Models,"Hongbang Yuan, Zhuoran Jin, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","LLM have achieved success in many fields but still troubled by problematic content in the training corpora. LLM unlearning aims at reducing their influence and avoid undesirable behaviours. However, existing unlearning methods remain vulnerable to adversarial queries and the unlearned knowledge resurfaces after the manually designed attack queries. As part of a red-team effort to proactively assess the vulnerabilities of unlearned models, we design Dynamic Unlearning Attack (DUA), a dynamic and automated framework to attack these models and evaluate their robustness. It optimizes adversarial suffixes to reintroduce the unlearned knowledge in various scenarios. We find that unlearned knowledge can be recovered in $55.2\%$ of the questions, even without revealing the unlearned model's parameters. In response to this vulnerability, we propose Latent Adversarial Unlearning (LAU), a universal framework that effectively enhances the robustness of the unlearned process. It formulates the unlearning process as a min-max optimization problem and resolves it through two stages: an attack stage, where perturbation vectors are trained and added to the latent space of LLMs to recover the unlearned knowledge, and a defense stage, where previously trained perturbation vectors are used to enhance unlearned model's robustness. With our LAU framework, we obtain two robust unlearning methods, AdvGA and AdvNPO. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple unlearning benchmarks and various models, and demonstrate that they improve the unlearning effectiveness by over $53.5\%$, cause only less than a $11.6\%$ reduction in neighboring knowledge, and have almost no impact on the model's general capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10682v1,2024-08

Traditionally, MoE models use homogeneous experts, each with identical capacity. However, varying complexity in input data necessitates experts with diverse capabilities, while homogeneous MoE hinders effective expert specialization and efficient parameter utilization. In this study, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (HMoE), where experts differ in size and thus possess diverse capacities. This heterogeneity allows for more specialized experts to handle varying token complexities more effectively. To address the imbalance in expert activation, we propose a novel training objective that encourages the frequent activation of smaller experts, enhancing computational efficiency and parameter utilization.

Specifically, we first compare various LoRA-based methods to find out their vulnerability to forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we propose to leverage the LoRA parameters from the original model for approximate orthogonal gradient descent on the new samples.

REInstruct: Building Instruction Data from Unlabeled Corpus,"Shu Chen, Xinyan Guan, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun","Manually annotating instruction data for large language models is difficult, costly, and hard to scale. Meanwhile, current automatic annotation methods typically rely on distilling synthetic data from proprietary LLMs, which not only limits the upper bound of the quality of the instruction data but also raises potential copyright issues. In this paper, we propose REInstruct, a simple and scalable method to automatically build instruction data from an unlabeled corpus without heavy reliance on proprietary LLMs and human annotation. Specifically, REInstruct first selects a subset of unlabeled texts that potentially contain well-structured helpful and insightful content and then generates instructions for these texts. To generate accurate and relevant responses for effective and robust training, REInstruct further proposes a rewriting-based approach to improve the quality of the generated instruction data. By training Llama-7b on a combination of 3k seed data and 32k synthetic data from REInstruct, fine-tuned model achieves a 65.41\% win rate on AlpacaEval leaderboard against text-davinci-003, outperforming other open-source, non-distilled instruction data construction methods.

Beneath the Surface of Consistency: Exploring Cross-lingual Knowledge Representation Sharing in LLMs,"Maxim Ifergan, Leshem Choshen, Roee Aharoni, Idan Szpektor, Omri Abend","The veracity of a factoid is largely independent of the language it is written in. However, language models are inconsistent in their ability to answer the same factual question across languages. This raises questions about how LLMs represent a given fact across languages. We explore multilingual factual knowledge through two aspects: the model's ability to answer a query consistently across languages, and the ability to ''store'' answers in a shared representation for several languages. We propose a methodology to measure the extent of representation sharing across languages by repurposing knowledge editing methods. We examine LLMs with various multilingual configurations using a new multilingual dataset. We reveal that high consistency does not necessarily imply shared representation, particularly for languages with different scripts. Moreover, we find that script similarity is a dominant factor in representation sharing. Finally, we observe that if LLMs could fully share knowledge across languages, their accuracy in their best-performing language could benefit an increase of up to 150\% on average. These findings highlight the need for improved multilingual knowledge representation in LLMs and suggest a path for the development of more robust and consistent multilingual LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10646v1,2024-08

Existing post-training pruning techniques primarily focus on measuring weight importance on converged dense models to determine salient weights to retain. However, they often overlook the changes in weight importance during the pruning process, which can lead to performance degradation in the pruned models. To address this issue, we present LLM-Barber (Block-Aware Rebuilder for Sparsity Mask in One-Shot), a novel one-shot pruning framework that rebuilds the sparsity mask of pruned models without any retraining or weight reconstruction. LLM-Barber incorporates block-aware error optimization across Self-Attention and MLP blocks, ensuring global performance optimization. Inspired by the recent discovery of prominent outliers in LLMs, LLM-Barber introduces an innovative pruning metric that identifies weight importance using weights multiplied by gradients. Our experiments show that LLM-Barber can efficiently prune models like LLaMA and OPT families with 7B to 13B parameters on a single A100 GPU in just 30 minutes, achieving state-of-the-art results in both perplexity and zero-shot performance across various language benchmarks.

Enhancing Robustness in Large Language Models: Prompting for Mitigating the Impact of Irrelevant Information,"Ming Jiang, Tingting Huang, Biao Guo, Yao Lu, Feng Zhang","In recent years, Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their superior performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies may diminish their reasoning capabilities markedly when problem descriptions contain irrelevant information, even with the use of advanced prompting techniques. To further investigate this issue, a dataset of primary school mathematics problems containing irrelevant information, named GSMIR, was constructed. Testing prominent LLMs and prompting techniques on this dataset revealed that while LLMs can identify irrelevant information, they do not effectively mitigate the interference it causes once identified. A novel automatic construction method, ATF, which enhances the ability of LLMs to identify and self-mitigate the influence of irrelevant information, is proposed to address this shortcoming. This method operates in two steps: first, analysis of irrelevant information, followed by its filtering. The ATF method, as demonstrated by experimental results, significantly improves the reasoning performance of LLMs and prompting techniques, even in the presence of irrelevant information on the GSMIR dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10615v1,2024-08
Promoting Equality in Large Language Models: Identifying and Mitigating the Implicit Bias based on Bayesian Theory,"Yongxin Deng, Xihe Qiu, Xiaoyu Tan, Jing Pan, Chen Jue, Zhijun Fang, Yinghui Xu, Wei Chu, Yuan Qi","Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive text corpora, which inevitably include biased information. Although techniques such as Affective Alignment can mitigate some negative impacts of these biases, existing prompt-based attack methods can still extract these biases from the model's weights. Moreover, these biases frequently appear subtly when LLMs are prompted to perform identical tasks across different demographic groups, thereby camouflaging their presence. To address this issue, we have formally defined the implicit bias problem and developed an innovative framework for bias removal based on Bayesian theory, Bayesian-Theory based Bias Removal (BTBR). BTBR employs likelihood ratio screening to pinpoint data entries within publicly accessible biased datasets that represent biases inadvertently incorporated during the LLM training phase. It then automatically constructs relevant knowledge triples and expunges bias information from LLMs using model editing techniques. Through extensive experimentation, we have confirmed the presence of the implicit bias problem in LLMs and demonstrated the effectiveness of our BTBR approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10608v1,2024-08
Multilingual Non-Factoid Question Answering with Silver Answers,"Ritwik Mishra, Sreeram Vennam, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","Most existing Question Answering Datasets (QuADs) primarily focus on factoid-based short-context Question Answering (QA) in high-resource languages. However, the scope of such datasets for low-resource languages remains limited, with only a few works centered on factoid-based QuADs and none on non-factoid QuADs. Therefore, this work presents MuNfQuAD, a multilingual QuAD with non-factoid questions. It utilizes interrogative sub-headings from BBC news articles as questions and the corresponding paragraphs as silver answers. The dataset comprises over 370K QA pairs across 38 languages, encompassing several low-resource languages, and stands as the largest multilingual QA dataset to date. Based on the manual annotations of 790 QA-pairs from MuNfQuAD (golden set), we observe that 98\% of questions can be answered using their corresponding silver answer. Our fine-tuned Answer Paragraph Selection (APS) model outperforms the baselines. The APS model attained an accuracy of 80\% and 72\%, as well as a macro F1 of 72\% and 66\%, on the MuNfQuAD testset and the golden set, respectively. Furthermore, the APS model effectively generalizes certain a language within the golden set, even after being fine-tuned on silver labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10604v1,2024-08
An Efficient Sign Language Translation Using Spatial Configuration and Motion Dynamics with LLMs,"Eui Jun Hwang, Sukmin Cho, Junmyeong Lee, Jong C. Park","Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) converts sign videos directly into spoken language sentences without relying on glosses. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable translation performance in gloss-free methods by harnessing their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these methods often rely on domain-specific fine-tuning of visual encoders to achieve optimal results. By contrast, this paper emphasizes the importance of capturing the spatial configurations and motion dynamics inherent in sign language. With this in mind, we introduce Spatial and Motion-based Sign Language Translation (SpaMo), a novel LLM-based SLT framework. The core idea of SpaMo is simple yet effective. We first extract spatial and motion features using off-the-shelf visual encoders and then input these features into an LLM with a language prompt. Additionally, we employ a visual-text alignment process as a warm-up before the SLT supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that SpaMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10593v2,2024-08
Putting People in LLMs' Shoes: Generating Better Answers via Question Rewriter,"Junhao Chen, Bowen Wang, Zhouqiang jiang, Yuta Nakashima","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities, particularly in the domain of question answering (QA). However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

Speech Representation Learning Revisited: The Necessity of Separate Learnable Parameters and Robust Data Augmentation,"Hemant Yadav, Sunayana Sitaram, Rajiv Ratn Shah","Speech modeling methods learn one embedding for a fixed segment of speech, typically in between 10-25 ms. The information present in speech can be divided into two categories: ""what is being said"" (content) and ""how it is expressed"" (other) and these two are orthogonal in nature causing the optimization algorithm to find a sub-optimal solution if forced to optimize together. This leads to sub-optimal performance in one or all downstream tasks as shown by previous studies. Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods such as HuBERT are very good at modeling the content information present in speech. Data augmentation improves the performance on tasks which require effective modeling of other information but this leads to a divided capacity of the model. In this work, we conduct a preliminary study to understand the importance of modeling other information using separate learnable parameters. We propose a modified version of HuBERT, termed Other HuBERT (O-HuBERT), to test our hypothesis. Our findings are twofold: first, the O-HuBERT method is able to utilize all layers to build complex features to encode other information; second, a robust data augmentation strategy is essential for learning the information required by tasks that depend on other information and to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the SUPERB benchmark with a similarly sized model (100 million parameters) and pre-training data (960 hours).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10557v1,2024-08
"Language Modeling on Tabular Data: A Survey of Foundations, Techniques and Evolution","Yucheng Ruan, Xiang Lan, Jingying Ma, Yizhi Dong, Kai He, Mengling Feng","Tabular data, a prevalent data type across various domains, presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature and complex structural relationships. Achieving high predictive performance and robustness in tabular data analysis holds significant promise for numerous applications. Influenced by recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly transformer architectures, new methods for tabular data modeling have emerged. Early techniques concentrated on pre-training transformers from scratch, often encountering scalability issues. Subsequently, methods leveraging pre-trained language models like BERT have been developed, which require less data and yield enhanced performance. The recent advent of large language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, has further revolutionized the field, facilitating more advanced and diverse applications with minimal fine-tuning. Despite the growing interest, a comprehensive survey of language modeling techniques for tabular data remains absent. This paper fills this gap by providing a systematic review of the development of language modeling for tabular data, encompassing: (1) a categorization of different tabular data structures and data types; (2) a review of key datasets used in model training and tasks used for evaluation; (3) a summary of modeling techniques including widely-adopted data processing methods, popular architectures, and training objectives; (4) the evolution from adapting traditional Pre-training/Pre-trained language models to the utilization of large language models; (5) an identification of persistent challenges and potential future research directions in language modeling for tabular data analysis.

"Synergistic Approach for Simultaneous Optimization of Monolingual, Cross-lingual, and Multilingual Information Retrieval","Adel Elmahdy, Sheng-Chieh Lin, Amin Ahmad","Information retrieval across different languages is an increasingly important challenge in natural language processing. Recent approaches based on multilingual pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success, yet they often optimize for either monolingual, cross-lingual, or multilingual retrieval performance at the expense of others. This paper proposes a novel hybrid batch training strategy to simultaneously improve zero-shot retrieval performance across monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual settings while mitigating language bias. The approach fine-tunes multilingual language models using a mix of monolingual and cross-lingual question-answer pair batches sampled based on dataset size. Experiments on XQuAD-R, MLQA-R, and MIRACL benchmark datasets show that the proposed method consistently achieves comparable or superior results in zero-shot retrieval across various languages and retrieval tasks compared to monolingual-only or cross-lingual-only training. Hybrid batch training also substantially reduces language bias in multilingual retrieval compared to monolingual training. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for learning language-agnostic representations that enable strong zero-shot retrieval performance across diverse languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10536v1,2024-08
"NoMatterXAI: Generating ""No Matter What"" Alterfactual Examples for Explaining Black-Box Text Classification Models","Tuc Nguyen, James Michels, Hua Shen, Thai Le","In Explainable AI (XAI), counterfactual explanations (CEs) are a well-studied method to communicate feature relevance through contrastive reasoning of ""what if"" to explain AI models' predictions. However, they only focus on important (i.e., relevant) features and largely disregard less important (i.e., irrelevant) ones. Such irrelevant features can be crucial in many applications, especially when users need to ensure that an AI model's decisions are not affected or biased against specific attributes such as gender, race, religion, or political affiliation. To address this gap, the concept of alterfactual explanations (AEs) has been proposed. AEs explore an alternative reality of ""no matter what"", where irrelevant features are substituted with alternative features (e.g., ""republicans"" -> ""democrats"") within the same attribute (e.g., ""politics"") while maintaining a similar prediction output. This serves to validate whether AI model predictions are influenced by the specified attributes. Despite the promise of AEs, there is a lack of computational approaches to systematically generate them, particularly in the text domain, where creating AEs for AI text classifiers presents unique challenges. This paper addresses this challenge by formulating AE generation as an optimization problem and introducing MoMatterXAI, a novel algorithm that generates AEs for text classification tasks. Our approach achieves high fidelity of up to 95% while preserving context similarity of over 90% across multiple models and datasets. A human study further validates the effectiveness of AEs in explaining AI text classifiers to end users. All codes will be publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10528v1,2024-08
XCB: an effective contextual biasing approach to bias cross-lingual phrases in speech recognition,"Xucheng Wan, Naijun Zheng, Kai Liu, Huan Zhou","Contextualized ASR models have been demonstrated to effectively improve the recognition accuracy of uncommon phrases when a predefined phrase list is available. However, these models often struggle with bilingual settings, which are prevalent in code-switching speech recognition. In this study, we make the initial attempt to address this challenge by introducing a Cross-lingual Contextual Biasing(XCB) module. Specifically, we augment a pre-trained ASR model for the dominant language by integrating an auxiliary language biasing module and a supplementary language-specific loss, aimed at enhancing the recognition of phrases in the secondary language. Experimental results conducted on our in-house code-switching dataset have validated the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in the recognition of biasing phrases in the secondary language, even without any additional inference overhead. Additionally, our proposed system exhibits both efficiency and generalization when is applied by the unseen ASRU-2019 test set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10524v1,2024-08

We propose a novel data augmentation framework to enhance SDS performance for user groups with limited resources. Our approach leverages a large language model (LLM) to extract speaker styles and a pre-trained language model (PLM) to simulate dialogue act history. This method generates enriched and personalized dialogue data, facilitating improved interactions with unique user demographics. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our methodology, highlighting its potential to foster the development of more adaptive and inclusive dialogue systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10516v1,2024-08
QUITO-X: A New Perspective on Context Compression from the Information Bottleneck Theory,"Yihang Wang, Xu Huang, Bowen Tian, Yueyang Su, Lei Yu, Huaming Liao, Yixing Fan, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng","Generative LLM have achieved remarkable success in various industrial applications, owing to their promising In-Context Learning capabilities. However, the issue of long context in complex tasks poses a significant barrier to their wider adoption, manifested in two main aspects: (i) The excessively long context leads to high costs and inference delays. (ii) A substantial amount of task-irrelevant information introduced by long contexts exacerbates the ""lost in the middle"" problem. Existing methods compress context by removing redundant tokens using metrics such as self-information or PPL, which is inconsistent with the objective of retaining the most important tokens when conditioning on a given query. In this study, we introduce information bottleneck theory (IB) to model the problem, offering a novel perspective that thoroughly addresses the essential properties required for context compression. Additionally, we propose a cross-attention-based approach to approximate mutual information in IB, which can be flexibly replaced with suitable alternatives in different scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 25% increase in compression rate compared to the state-of-the-art, while maintaining question answering performance. In particular, the context compressed by our method even outperform the full context in some cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10497v2,2024-08
Analysis of Plan-based Retrieval for Grounded Text Generation,"Ameya Godbole, Nicholas Monath, Seungyeon Kim, Ankit Singh Rawat, Andrew McCallum, Manzil Zaheer","In text generation, hallucinations refer to the generation of seemingly coherent text that contradicts established knowledge. One compelling hypothesis is that hallucinations occur when a language model is given a generation task outside its parametric knowledge (due to rarity, recency, domain, etc.). A common strategy to address this limitation is to infuse the language models with retrieval mechanisms, providing the model with relevant knowledge for the task. In this paper, we leverage the planning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs and analyze how planning can be used to guide retrieval to further reduce the frequency of hallucinations. We empirically evaluate several variations of our proposed approach on long-form text generation tasks. By improving the coverage of relevant facts, plan-guided retrieval and generation can produce more informative responses while providing a higher rate of attribution to source documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10490v1,2024-08
Event Stream based Sign Language Translation: A High-Definition Benchmark Dataset and A New Algorithm,"Xiao Wang, Yao Rong, Fuling Wang, Jianing Li, Lin Zhu, Bo Jiang, Yaowei Wang","Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a core task in the field of AI-assisted disability. Unlike traditional SLT based on visible light videos, which is easily affected by factors such as lighting, rapid hand movements, and privacy breaches, this paper proposes the use of high-definition Event streams for SLT, effectively mitigating the aforementioned issues. This is primarily because Event streams have a high dynamic range and dense temporal signals, which can withstand low illumination and motion blur well. Additionally, due to their sparsity in space, they effectively protect the privacy of the target person. More specifically, we propose a new high-resolution Event stream sign language dataset, termed Event-CSL, which effectively fills the data gap in this area of research. It contains 14,827 videos, 14,821 glosses, and 2,544 Chinese words in the text vocabulary. These samples are collected in a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes, encompassing multiple angles, light intensities, and camera movements. We have benchmarked existing mainstream SLT works to enable fair comparison for future efforts. Based on this dataset and several other large-scale datasets, we propose a novel baseline method that fully leverages the Mamba model's ability to integrate temporal information of CNN features, resulting in improved sign language translation outcomes.

LeCov: Multi-level Testing Criteria for Large Language Models,"Xuan Xie, Jiayang Song, Yuheng Huang, Da Song, Fuyuan Zhang, Felix Juefei-Xu, Lei Ma","Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in many different domains, but because of their limited interpretability, there are questions about how trustworthy they are in various perspectives, e.g., truthfulness and toxicity. Recent research has started developing testing methods for LLMs, aiming to uncover untrustworthy issues, i.e., defects, before deployment. However, systematic and formalized testing criteria are lacking, which hinders a comprehensive assessment of the extent and adequacy of testing exploration. To mitigate this threat, we propose a set of multi-level testing criteria, LeCov, for LLMs. The criteria consider three crucial LLM internal components, i.e., the attention mechanism, feed-forward neurons, and uncertainty, and contain nine types of testing criteria in total. We apply the criteria in two scenarios: test prioritization and coverage-guided testing. The experiment evaluation, on three models and four datasets, demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of LeCov.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10474v1,2024-08
Enhancing One-shot Pruned Pre-trained Language Models through Sparse-Dense-Sparse Mechanism,"Guanchen Li, Xiandong Zhao, Lian Liu, Zeping Li, Dong Li, Lu Tian, Jie He, Ashish Sirasao, Emad Barsoum","Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are engineered to be robust in contextual understanding and exhibit outstanding performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, their considerable size incurs significant computational and storage costs. Modern pruning strategies employ one-shot techniques to compress PLMs without the need for retraining on task-specific or otherwise general data; however, these approaches often lead to an indispensable reduction in performance. In this paper, we propose SDS, a Sparse-Dense-Sparse pruning framework to enhance the performance of the pruned PLMs from a weight distribution optimization perspective. We outline the pruning process in three steps. Initially, we prune less critical connections in the model using conventional one-shot pruning methods. Next, we reconstruct a dense model featuring a pruning-friendly weight distribution by reactivating pruned connections with sparse regularization. Finally, we perform a second pruning round, yielding a superior pruned model compared to the initial pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that SDS outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning techniques SparseGPT and Wanda under an identical sparsity configuration. For instance, SDS reduces perplexity by 9.13 on Raw-Wikitext2 and improves accuracy by an average of 2.05% across multiple zero-shot benchmarks for OPT-125M with 2:4 sparsity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10473v1,2024-08
Tracing Privacy Leakage of Language Models to Training Data via Adjusted Influence Functions,"Jinxin Liu, Zao Yang","The responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can include sensitive information from individuals and organizations, leading to potential privacy leakage. This work implements Influence Functions (IFs) to trace privacy leakage back to the training data, thereby mitigating privacy concerns of Language Models (LMs). However, we notice that current IFs struggle to accurately estimate the influence of tokens with large gradient norms, potentially overestimating their influence. When tracing the most influential samples, this leads to frequently tracing back to samples with large gradient norm tokens, overshadowing the actual most influential samples even if their influences are well estimated. To address this issue, we propose Heuristically Adjusted IF (HAIF), which reduces the weight of tokens with large gradient norms, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of tracing the most influential samples. To establish easily obtained groundtruth for tracing privacy leakage, we construct two datasets, PII-E and PII-CR, representing two distinct scenarios: one with identical text in the model outputs and pre-training data, and the other where models leverage their reasoning abilities to generate text divergent from pre-training data. HAIF significantly improves tracing accuracy, enhancing it by 20.96% to 73.71% on the PII-E dataset and 3.21% to 45.93% on the PII-CR dataset, compared to the best SOTA IFs against various GPT-2 and QWen-1.5 models. HAIF also outperforms SOTA IFs on real-world pretraining data CLUECorpus2020, demonstrating strong robustness regardless prompt and response lengths.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10468v4,2024-08
Federated Learning of Large ASR Models in the Real World,"Yonghui Xiao, Yuxin Ding, Changwan Ryu, Petr Zadrazil, Francoise Beaufays","Federated learning (FL) has shown promising results on training machine learning models with privacy preservation. However, for large models with over 100 million parameters, the training resource requirement becomes an obstacle for FL because common devices do not have enough memory and computation power to finish the FL tasks. Although efficient training methods have been proposed, it is still a challenge to train the large models like Conformer based ASR. This paper presents a systematic solution to train the full-size ASR models of 130M parameters with FL. To our knowledge, this is the first real-world FL application of the Conformer model, which is also the largest model ever trained with FL so far. And this is the first paper showing FL can improve the ASR model quality with a set of proposed methods to refine the quality of data and labels of clients. We demonstrate both the training efficiency and the model quality improvement in real-world experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10443v1,2024-08
Goldfish: Monolingual Language Models for 350 Languages,"Tyler A. Chang, Catherine Arnett, Zhuowen Tu, Benjamin K. Bergen","For many low-resource languages, the only available language models are large multilingual models trained on many languages simultaneously. However, using FLORES perplexity as a metric, we find that these models perform worse than bigrams for many languages (e.g. 24% of languages in XGLM 4.5B; 43% in BLOOM 7.1B). To facilitate research that focuses on low-resource languages, we pre-train and release Goldfish, a suite of monolingual autoregressive Transformer language models up to 125M parameters for 350 languages. The Goldfish reach lower FLORES perplexities than BLOOM, XGLM, and MaLA-500 on 98 of 204 FLORES languages, despite each Goldfish model being over 10x smaller. However, the Goldfish significantly underperform larger multilingual models on reasoning benchmarks, suggesting that for low-resource languages, multilinguality primarily improves general reasoning abilities rather than basic text generation. We release models trained on 5MB (350 languages), 10MB (288 languages), 100MB (166 languages), and 1GB (83 languages) of text data where available. The Goldfish models are available as baselines, fine-tuning sources, or augmentations to existing models in low-resource NLP research, and they are further useful for crosslinguistic studies requiring maximally comparable models across languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10441v1,2024-08

Resolving Lexical Bias in Edit Scoping with Projector Editor Networks,"Hammad Rizwan, Domenic Rosati, Ga Wu, Hassan Sajjad","Weight-preserving model editing techniques heavily rely on the scoping mechanism that decides when to apply an edit to the base model. These scoping mechanisms utilize distance functions in the representation space to ascertain the scope of the edit. In this work, we show that distance-based scoping functions grapple with lexical biases leading to issues such as misfires with irrelevant prompts that share similar lexical characteristics. To address this problem, we introduce, Projector Editor Networks for Model Editing (PENME),is a model editing approach that employs a compact adapter with a projection network trained via a contrastive learning objective.

Currently, this alignment process relies on the availability of high-quality supervised and preference data, which can be both time-consuming and expensive to curate or annotate. In this paper, we introduce a systematic end-to-end methodology for aligning LLMs to the implicit and explicit values represented in unstructured text data. Our proposed approach leverages the use of scalable synthetic data generation techniques to effectively align the model to the values present in the unstructured data. Through two distinct use-cases, we demonstrate the efficiency of our methodology on the Mistral-7B-Instruct model.

Narrowing the Gap between Vision and Action in Navigation,"Yue Zhang, Parisa Kordjamshidi","The existing methods for Vision and Language Navigation in the Continuous Environment (VLN-CE) commonly incorporate a waypoint predictor to discretize the environment. This simplifies the navigation actions into a view selection task and improves navigation performance significantly compared to direct training using low-level actions. However, the VLN-CE agents are still far from the real robots since there are gaps between their visual perception and executed actions. First, VLN-CE agents that discretize the visual environment are primarily trained with high-level view selection, which causes them to ignore crucial spatial reasoning within the low-level action movements. Second, in these models, the existing waypoint predictors neglect object semantics and their attributes related to passibility, which can be informative in indicating the feasibility of actions. To address these two issues, we introduce a low-level action decoder jointly trained with high-level action prediction, enabling the current VLN agent to learn and ground the selected visual view to the low-level controls. Moreover, we enhance the current waypoint predictor by utilizing visual representations containing rich semantic information and explicitly masking obstacles based on humans' prior knowledge about the feasibility of actions. Empirically, our agent can improve navigation performance metrics compared to the strong baselines on both high-level and low-level actions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10388v1,2024-08
Beyond Relevant Documents: A Knowledge-Intensive Approach for Query-Focused Summarization using Large Language Models,"Weijia Zhang, Jia-Hong Huang, Svitlana Vakulenko, Yumo Xu, Thilina Rajapakse, Evangelos Kanoulas","Query-focused summarization (QFS) is a fundamental task in natural language processing with broad applications, including search engines and report generation. However, traditional approaches assume the availability of relevant documents, which may not always hold in practical scenarios, especially in highly specialized topics. To address this limitation, we propose a novel knowledge-intensive approach that reframes QFS as a knowledge-intensive task setup. This approach comprises two main components: a retrieval module and a summarization controller. The retrieval module efficiently retrieves potentially relevant documents from a large-scale knowledge corpus based on the given textual query, eliminating the dependence on pre-existing document sets. The summarization controller seamlessly integrates a powerful large language model (LLM)-based summarizer with a carefully tailored prompt, ensuring the generated summary is comprehensive and relevant to the query. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we create a new dataset, along with human-annotated relevance labels, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation covering both retrieval and summarization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, particularly its ability to generate accurate summaries without relying on the availability of relevant documents initially. This underscores our method's versatility and practical applicability across diverse query scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10357v1,2024-08
DELIA: Diversity-Enhanced Learning for Instruction Adaptation in Large Language Models,"Yuanhao Zeng, Fei Ren, Xinpeng Zhou, Yihang Wang, Yingxia Shao","Although instruction tuning is widely used to adjust behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), extensive empirical evidence and research indicates that it is primarily a process where the model fits to specific task formats, rather than acquiring new knowledge or capabilities. We propose that this limitation stems from biased features learned during instruction tuning, which differ from ideal task-specfic features, leading to learn less underlying semantics in downstream tasks. However, ideal features are unknown and incalculable, constraining past work to rely on prior knowledge to assist reasoning or training, which limits LLMs' capabilities to the developers' abilities, rather than data-driven scalable learning. In our paper, through our novel data synthesis method, DELIA (Diversity-Enhanced Learning for Instruction Adaptation), we leverage the buffering effect of extensive diverse data in LLMs training to transform biased features in instruction tuning into approximations of ideal features, without explicit prior ideal features. Experiments show DELIA's better performance compared to common instruction tuning and other baselines. It outperforms common instruction tuning by 17.07%-33.41% on Icelandic-English translation bleurt score (WMT-21 dataset, gemma-7b-it) and improves accuracy by 36.1% on formatted text generation (Llama2-7b-chat).

We introduce LongVILA, a full-stack solution for long-context visual-language models by co-designing the algorithm and system. For model training, we upgrade existing VLMs to support long video understanding by incorporating two additional stages, i.e., long context extension and long video supervised fine-tuning. However, training on long video is computationally and memory intensive. We introduce the long-context Multi-Modal Sequence Parallelism (MM-SP) system that efficiently parallelizes long video training and inference, enabling 2M context length training on 256 GPUs without any gradient checkpointing. LongVILA efficiently extends the number of video frames of VILA from 8 to 2048, achieving 99.8% accuracy in 6,000-frame (more than 1 million tokens) video needle-in-a-haystack. LongVILA-7B demonstrates strong accuracy on 9 popular video benchmarks, e.g. 65.1% VideoMME with subtitle. Besides, MM-SP is 2.1x - 5.7x faster than ring style sequence parallelism and 1.1x - 1.4x faster than Megatron with a hybrid context and tensor parallelism. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with Hugging Face Transformers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10188v6,2024-08
Multilingual Needle in a Haystack: Investigating Long-Context Behavior of Multilingual Large Language Models,"Amey Hengle, Prasoon Bajpai, Soham Dan, Tanmoy Chakraborty","While recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable abilities in responding to queries in diverse languages, their ability to handle long multilingual contexts is unexplored. As such, a systematic evaluation of the long-context capabilities of LLMs in multilingual settings is crucial, specifically in the context of information retrieval. To address this gap, we introduce the MultiLingual Needle-in-a-Haystack (MLNeedle) test, designed to assess a model's ability to retrieve relevant information (the needle) from a collection of multilingual distractor texts (the haystack). This test serves as an extension of the multilingual question-answering task, encompassing both monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on MLNeedle. Our findings reveal that model performance can vary significantly with language and needle position. Specifically, we observe that model performance is the lowest when the needle is (i) in a language outside the English language family and (ii) located in the middle of the input context. Furthermore, although some models claim a context size of $8k$ tokens or greater, none demonstrate satisfactory cross-lingual retrieval performance as the context length increases. Our analysis provides key insights into the long-context behavior of LLMs in multilingual settings to guide future evaluation protocols. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the multilingual long-context behavior of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10151v1,2024-08
In-Context Learning with Representations: Contextual Generalization of Trained Transformers,"Tong Yang, Yu Huang, Yingbin Liang, Yuejie Chi","In-context learning (ICL) refers to a remarkable capability of pretrained large language models, which can learn a new task given a few examples during inference. However, theoretical understanding of ICL is largely under-explored, particularly whether transformers can be trained to generalize to unseen examples in a prompt, which will require the model to acquire contextual knowledge of the prompt for generalization. This paper investigates the training dynamics of transformers by gradient descent through the lens of non-linear regression tasks. The contextual generalization here can be attained via learning the template function for each task in-context, where all template functions lie in a linear space with $m$ basis functions. We analyze the training dynamics of one-layer multi-head transformers to in-contextly predict unlabeled inputs given partially labeled prompts, where the labels contain Gaussian noise and the number of examples in each prompt are not sufficient to determine the template. Under mild assumptions, we show that the training loss for a one-layer multi-head transformer converges linearly to a global minimum. Moreover, the transformer effectively learns to perform ridge regression over the basis functions. To our knowledge, this study is the first provable demonstration that transformers can learn contextual (i.e., template) information to generalize to both unseen examples and tasks when prompts contain only a small number of query-answer pairs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10147v2,2024-08

To enhance the rhyming quality of generated lyrics, we incorporate integrated rhyme information into our model, thereby improving lyric generation performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10130v1,2024-08
GLIMMER: Incorporating Graph and Lexical Features in Unsupervised Multi-Document Summarization,"Ran Liu, Ming Liu, Min Yu, Jianguo Jiang, Gang Li, Dan Zhang, Jingyuan Li, Xiang Meng, Weiqing Huang","Pre-trained language models are increasingly being used in multi-document summarization tasks. However, these models need large-scale corpora for pre-training and are domain-dependent. Other non-neural unsupervised summarization approaches mostly rely on key sentence extraction, which can lead to information loss. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight yet effective unsupervised approach called GLIMMER: a Graph and LexIcal features based unsupervised Multi-docuMEnt summaRization approach. It first constructs a sentence graph from the source documents, then automatically identifies semantic clusters by mining low-level features from raw texts, thereby improving intra-cluster correlation and the fluency of generated sentences. Finally, it summarizes clusters into natural sentences. Experiments conducted on Multi-News, Multi-XScience and DUC-2004 demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing unsupervised approaches. Furthermore, it surpasses state-of-the-art pre-trained multi-document summarization models (e.g. PEGASUS and PRIMERA) under zero-shot settings in terms of ROUGE scores. Additionally, human evaluations indicate that summaries generated by GLIMMER achieve high readability and informativeness scores.

Personalizing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Variational Preference Learning,"Sriyash Poddar, Yanming Wan, Hamish Ivison, Abhishek Gupta, Natasha Jaques","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a powerful paradigm for aligning foundation models to human values and preferences. However, current RLHF techniques cannot account for the naturally occurring differences in individual human preferences across a diverse population. When these differences arise, traditional RLHF frameworks simply average over them, leading to inaccurate rewards and poor performance for individual subgroups. To address the need for pluralistic alignment, we develop a class of multimodal RLHF methods. Our proposed techniques are based on a latent variable formulation - inferring a novel user-specific latent and learning reward models and policies conditioned on this latent without additional user-specific data. While conceptually simple, we show that in practice, this reward modeling requires careful algorithmic considerations around model architecture and reward scaling. To empirically validate our proposed technique, we first show that it can provide a way to combat underspecification in simulated control problems, inferring and optimizing user-specific reward functions. Next, we conduct experiments on pluralistic language datasets representing diverse user preferences and demonstrate improved reward function accuracy. We additionally show the benefits of this probabilistic framework in terms of measuring uncertainty, and actively learning user preferences. This work enables learning from diverse populations of users with divergent preferences, an important challenge that naturally occurs in problems from robot learning to foundation model alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10075v1,2024-08
Privacy Checklist: Privacy Violation Detection Grounding on Contextual Integrity Theory,"Haoran Li, Wei Fan, Yulin Chen, Jiayang Cheng, Tianshu Chu, Xuebing Zhou, Peizhao Hu, Yangqiu Song","Privacy research has attracted wide attention as individuals worry that their private data can be easily leaked during interactions with smart devices, social platforms, and AI applications. Computer science researchers, on the other hand, commonly study privacy issues through privacy attacks and defenses on segmented fields. Privacy research is conducted on various sub-fields, including Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Networks. Within each field, privacy has its own formulation. Though pioneering works on attacks and defenses reveal sensitive privacy issues, they are narrowly trapped and cannot fully cover people's actual privacy concerns. Consequently, the research on general and human-centric privacy research remains rather unexplored. In this paper, we formulate the privacy issue as a reasoning problem rather than simple pattern matching. We ground on the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory which posits that people's perceptions of privacy are highly correlated with the corresponding social context. Based on such an assumption, we develop the first comprehensive checklist that covers social identities, private attributes, and existing privacy regulations. Unlike prior works on CI that either cover limited expert annotated norms or model incomplete social context, our proposed privacy checklist uses the whole Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as an example, to show that we can resort to large language models (LLMs) to completely cover the HIPAA's regulations. Additionally, our checklist also gathers expert annotations across multiple ontologies to determine private information including but not limited to personally identifiable information (PII). We use our preliminary results on the HIPAA to shed light on future context-centric privacy research to cover more privacy regulations, social norms and standards.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10053v1,2024-08
MegaFake: A Theory-Driven Dataset of Fake News Generated by Large Language Models,"Lionel Z.

C${^2}$RL: Content and Context Representation Learning for Gloss-free Sign Language Translation and Retrieval,"Zhigang Chen, Benjia Zhou, Yiqing Huang, Jun Wan, Yibo Hu, Hailin Shi, Yanyan Liang, Zhen Lei, Du Zhang","Sign Language Representation Learning (SLRL) is crucial for a range of sign language-related downstream tasks such as Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Sign Language Retrieval (SLRet). Recently, many gloss-based and gloss-free SLRL methods have been proposed, showing promising performance. Among them, the gloss-free approach shows promise for strong scalability without relying on gloss annotations. However, it currently faces suboptimal solutions due to challenges in encoding the intricate, context-sensitive characteristics of sign language videos, mainly struggling to discern essential sign features using a non-monotonic video-text alignment strategy. Therefore, we introduce an innovative pretraining paradigm for gloss-free SLRL, called C${^2}$RL, in this paper. Specifically, rather than merely incorporating a non-monotonic semantic alignment of video and text to learn language-oriented sign features, we emphasize two pivotal aspects of SLRL: Implicit Content Learning (ICL) and Explicit Context Learning (ECL). ICL delves into the content of communication, capturing the nuances, emphasis, timing, and rhythm of the signs. In contrast, ECL focuses on understanding the contextual meaning of signs and converting them into equivalent sentences. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments confirm that the joint optimization of ICL and ECL results in robust sign language representation and significant performance gains in gloss-free SLT and SLRet tasks. Notably, C${^2}$RL improves the BLEU-4 score by +5.3 on P14T, +10.6 on CSL-daily, +6.2 on OpenASL, and +1.3 on How2Sign. It also boosts the R@1 score by +8.3 on P14T, +14.4 on CSL-daily, and +5.9 on How2Sign. Additionally, we set a new baseline for the OpenASL dataset in the SLRet task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09949v1,2024-08
Microscopic Analysis on LLM players via Social Deduction Game,"Byungjun Kim, Dayeon Seo, Bugeun Kim","Recent studies have begun developing autonomous game players for social deduction games using large language models (LLMs). When building LLM players, fine-grained evaluations are crucial for addressing weaknesses in game-playing abilities. However, existing studies have often overlooked such assessments. Specifically, we point out two issues with the evaluation methods employed. First, game-playing abilities have typically been assessed through game-level outcomes rather than specific event-level skills; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies. To address these issues, we propose an approach utilizing a variant of the SpyFall game, named SpyGame. We conducted an experiment with four LLMs, analyzing their gameplay behavior in SpyGame both quantitatively and qualitatively. For the quantitative analysis, we introduced eight metrics to resolve the first issue, revealing that these metrics are more effective than existing ones for evaluating the two critical skills: intent identification and camouflage. In the qualitative analysis, we performed thematic analysis to resolve the second issue. This analysis identifies four major categories that affect gameplay of LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate how these categories complement and support the findings from the quantitative analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09946v1,2024-08
"Large Language Models for Classical Chinese Poetry Translation: Benchmarking, Evaluating, and Improving","Andong Chen, Lianzhang Lou, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Yang Xiang, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang","Different from the traditional translation tasks, classical Chinese poetry translation requires both adequacy and fluency in translating culturally and historically significant content and linguistic poetic elegance. Large language models (LLMs) with impressive multilingual capabilities may bring a ray of hope to achieve this extreme translation demand. This paper first introduces a suitable benchmark (PoetMT) where each Chinese poetry has a recognized elegant translation. Meanwhile, we propose a new metric based on GPT-4 to evaluate the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the existing LLMs fall short in the challenging task. Hence, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Machine Translation (RAT) method which incorporates knowledge related to classical poetry for advancing the translation of Chinese Poetry in LLMs. Experimental results show that RAT consistently outperforms all comparison methods regarding wildly used BLEU, COMET, BLEURT, our proposed metric, and human evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09945v4,2024-08
"""Image, Tell me your story!"" Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation","Jonathan Tonglet, Marie-Francine Moens, Iryna Gurevych","To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web. Our experiments show promising results while highlighting several open challenges in retrieval and reasoning. We make our code and data publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09939v2,2024-08
Attribution Analysis Meets Model Editing: Advancing Knowledge Correction in Vision Language Models with VisEdit,"Qizhou Chen, Taolin Zhang, Chengyu Wang, Xiaofeng He, Dakan Wang, Tingting Liu","Model editing aims to correct outdated or erroneous knowledge in large models without costly retraining. Recent research discovered that the mid-layer representation of the subject's final token in a prompt has a strong influence on factual predictions, and developed Large Language Model (LLM) editing techniques based on this observation. However, for Vision-LLMs (VLLMs), how visual representations impact the predictions from a decoder-only language model remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, model editing for VLLMs has not been extensively studied in the literature. In this work, we employ the contribution allocation and noise perturbation methods to measure the contributions of visual representations for token predictions. Our attribution analysis shows that visual representations in mid-to-later layers that are highly relevant to the prompt contribute significantly to predictions. Based on these insights, we propose VisEdit, a novel model editor for VLLMs that effectively corrects knowledge by editing intermediate visual representations in regions important to the edit prompt. We evaluated VisEdit using multiple VLLM backbones and public VLLM editing benchmark datasets. The results show the superiority of VisEdit over the strong baselines adapted from existing state-of-the-art editors for LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09916v2,2024-08
Active Learning for Identifying Disaster-Related Tweets: A Comparison with Keyword Filtering and Generic Fine-Tuning,"David Hanny, Sebastian Schmidt, Bernd Resch","Information from social media can provide essential information for emergency response during natural disasters in near real-time. However, it is difficult to identify the disaster-related posts among the large amounts of unstructured data available. Previous methods often use keyword filtering, topic modelling or classification-based techniques to identify such posts. Active Learning (AL) presents a promising sub-field of Machine Learning (ML) that has not been used much in the field of text classification of social media content. This study therefore investigates the potential of AL for identifying disaster-related Tweets. We compare a keyword filtering approach, a RoBERTa model fine-tuned with generic data from CrisisLex, a base RoBERTa model trained with AL and a fine-tuned RoBERTa model trained with AL regarding classification performance. For testing, data from CrisisLex and manually labelled data from the 2021 flood in Germany and the 2023 Chile forest fires were considered. The results show that generic fine-tuning combined with 10 rounds of AL outperformed all other approaches. Consequently, a broadly applicable model for the identification of disaster-related Tweets could be trained with very little labelling effort. The model can be applied to use cases beyond this study and provides a useful tool for further research in social media analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09914v1,2024-08
Performance Law of Large Language Models,"Chuhan Wu, Ruiming Tang","Guided by the belief of the scaling law, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, scaling law only gives a qualitative estimation of loss, which is influenced by various factors such as model architectures, data distributions, tokenizers, and computation precision. Thus, estimating the real performance of LLMs with different training settings rather than loss may be quite useful in practical development. In this article, we present an empirical equation named ""Performance Law"" to directly predict the MMLU score of an LLM, which is a widely used metric to indicate the general capability of LLMs in real-world conversations and applications. Based on only a few key hyperparameters of the LLM architecture and the size of training data, we obtain a quite accurate MMLU prediction of various LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures developed by different organizations in different years. Performance law can be used to guide the choice of LLM architecture and the effective allocation of computational resources without extensive experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09895v4,2024-08

MAPLE: Enhancing Review Generation with Multi-Aspect Prompt LEarning in Explainable Recommendation,"Ching-Wen Yang, Che Wei Chen, Kun-da Wu, Hao Xu, Jui-Feng Yao, Hung-Yu Kao","Explainable Recommendation task is designed to receive a pair of user and item and output explanations to justify why an item is recommended to a user. Many models treat review-generation as a proxy of explainable recommendation.

We propose a personalized, aspect-controlled model called Multi-Aspect Prompt LEarner (MAPLE), in which it integrates aspect category as another input dimension to facilitate the memorization of fine-grained aspect terms. Experiments on two real-world review datasets in restaurant domain show that MAPLE outperforms the baseline review-generation models in terms of text and feature diversity while maintaining excellent coherence and factual relevance. We further treat MAPLE as a retriever component in the retriever-reader framework and employ a Large-Language Model (LLM) as the reader, showing that MAPLE's explanation along with the LLM's comprehension ability leads to enriched and personalized explanation as a result.

TaSL uses a novel group-wise technique to pinpoint task-specific and task-shared areas. Additionally, a fine-grained skill consolidation strategy protects task-specific knowledge from being forgotten while updating shared knowledge for bi-directional knowledge transfer.

To address this issue, one straightforward solution is to introduce task-specific LoRA modules as domain experts, leveraging the modeling of multiple experts' capabilities and thus enhancing the general capability of multi-task learning. Despite promising, these additional components often add complexity to the training and inference process, contravening the efficient characterization of PEFT designed for. Considering this, we introduce an innovative PEFT method, TeamLoRA, consisting of a collaboration and competition module for experts, and thus achieving the right balance of effectiveness and efficiency: (i) For collaboration, a novel knowledge-sharing and -organizing mechanism is devised to appropriately reduce the scale of matrix operations, thereby boosting the training and inference speed. (ii) For competition, we propose leveraging a game-theoretic interaction mechanism for experts, encouraging experts to transfer their domain-specific knowledge while facing diverse downstream tasks, and thus enhancing the performance. By doing so, TeamLoRA elegantly connects the experts as a ""Team"" with internal collaboration and competition, enabling a faster and more accurate PEFT paradigm for multi-task learning. To validate the superiority of TeamLoRA, we curate a comprehensive multi-task evaluation(CME) benchmark to thoroughly assess the capability of multi-task learning. Experiments conducted on our CME and other benchmarks indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of TeamLoRA.

Self-Directed Turing Test for Large Language Models,"Weiqi Wu, Hongqiu Wu, Hai Zhao","The Turing test examines whether AIs can exhibit human-like behaviour in natural language conversations. Traditional Turing tests adopt a rigid dialogue format where each participant sends only one message each time and require continuous human involvement to direct the entire interaction with the test subject. This fails to reflect a natural conversational style and hinders the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex and prolonged dialogues. This paper proposes the Self-Directed Turing Test, which extends the original test with a burst dialogue format, allowing more dynamic exchanges by multiple consecutive messages. It further efficiently reduces human workload by having the LLM self-direct the majority of the test process, iteratively generating dialogues that simulate its interaction with humans. With the pseudo-dialogue history, the model then engages in a shorter dialogue with a human, which is paired with a human-human conversation on the same topic to be judged using questionnaires. We introduce the X-Turn Pass-Rate metric to assess the human likeness of LLMs across varying durations. While LLMs like GPT-4 initially perform well, achieving pass rates of 51.9% and 38.9% during 3 turns and 10 turns of dialogues respectively, their performance drops as the dialogue progresses, which underscores the difficulty in maintaining consistency in the long term.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09853v1,2024-08
Importance Weighting Can Help Large Language Models Self-Improve,"Chunyang Jiang, Chi-min Chan, Wei Xue, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capability in numerous tasks and applications. However, fine-tuning LLMs using high-quality datasets under external supervision remains prohibitively expensive. In response, LLM self-improvement approaches have been vibrantly developed recently. The typical paradigm of LLM self-improvement involves training LLM on self-generated data, part of which may be detrimental and should be filtered out due to the unstable data quality. While current works primarily employs filtering strategies based on answer correctness, in this paper, we demonstrate that filtering out correct but with high distribution shift extent (DSE) samples could also benefit the results of self-improvement. Given that the actual sample distribution is usually inaccessible, we propose a new metric called DS weight to approximate DSE, inspired by the Importance Weighting methods. Consequently, we integrate DS weight with self-consistency to comprehensively filter the self-generated samples and fine-tune the language model. Experiments show that with only a tiny valid set (up to 5\% size of the training set) to compute DS weight, our approach can notably promote the reasoning ability of current LLM self-improvement methods. The resulting performance is on par with methods that rely on external supervision from pre-trained reward models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09849v2,2024-08
Continual Dialogue State Tracking via Reason-of-Select Distillation,"Yujie Feng, Bo Liu, Xiaoyu Dong, Zexin Lu, Li-Ming Zhan, Albert Y. S. Lam, Xiao-Ming Wu","An ideal dialogue system requires continuous skill acquisition and adaptation to new tasks while retaining prior knowledge. Dialogue State Tracking (DST), vital in these systems, often involves learning new services and confronting catastrophic forgetting, along with a critical capability loss termed the ""Value Selection Quandary."" To address these challenges, we introduce the Reason-of-Select (RoS) distillation method by enhancing smaller models with a novel 'meta-reasoning' capability. Meta-reasoning employs an enhanced multi-domain perspective, combining fragments of meta-knowledge from domain-specific dialogues during continual learning. This transcends traditional single-perspective reasoning. The domain bootstrapping process enhances the model's ability to dissect intricate dialogues from multiple possible values. Its domain-agnostic property aligns data distribution across different domains, effectively mitigating forgetting. Additionally, two novel improvements, ""multi-value resolution"" strategy and Semantic Contrastive Reasoning Selection method, significantly enhance RoS by generating DST-specific selection chains and mitigating hallucinations in teachers' reasoning, ensuring effective and reliable knowledge transfer.

With these sources, we aim to create a moral evaluation dataset characterized by diversity and authenticity. We develop a morality taxonomy and a set of fundamental moral principles that are not only rooted in traditional Chinese culture but also consistent with contemporary societal norms. To facilitate efficient construction and annotation of instances in CMoralEval, we establish a platform with AI-assisted instance generation to streamline the annotation process. These help us curate CMoralEval that encompasses both explicit moral scenarios (14,964 instances) and moral dilemma scenarios (15,424 instances), each with instances from different data sources.

AutoML-guided Fusion of Entity and LLM-based Representations for Document Classification,"Boshko Koloski, Senja Pollak, Roberto Navigli, Blaž Škrlj","Large semantic knowledge bases are grounded in factual knowledge. However, recent approaches to dense text representations (i.e. embeddings) do not efficiently exploit these resources. Dense and robust representations of documents are essential for effectively solving downstream classification and retrieval tasks. This work demonstrates that injecting embedded information from knowledge bases can augment the performance of contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based representations for the task of text classification. Further, by considering automated machine learning (AutoML) with the fused representation space, we demonstrate it is possible to improve classification accuracy even if we use low-dimensional projections of the original representation space obtained via efficient matrix factorization. This result shows that significantly faster classifiers can be achieved with minimal or no loss in predictive performance, as demonstrated using five strong LLM baselines on six diverse real-life datasets.

To overcome these limitations and automate the animation process, we pioneer the introduction of large multimodal models (LMMs) as the core processor to build an autonomous animation-making agent, named Anim-Director. This agent mainly harnesses the advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities of LMMs and generative AI tools to create animated videos from concise narratives or simple instructions. Specifically, it operates in three main stages: Firstly, the Anim-Director generates a coherent storyline from user inputs, followed by a detailed director's script that encompasses settings of character profiles and interior/exterior descriptions, and context-coherent scene descriptions that include appearing characters, interiors or exteriors, and scene events. Secondly, we employ LMMs with the image generation tool to produce visual images of settings and scenes. These images are designed to maintain visual consistency across different scenes using a visual-language prompting method that combines scene descriptions and images of the appearing character and setting. Thirdly, scene images serve as the foundation for producing animated videos, with LMMs generating prompts to guide this process. The whole process is notably autonomous without manual intervention, as the LMMs interact seamlessly with generative tools to generate prompts, evaluate visual quality, and select the best one to optimize the final output.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09787v1,2024-08
GoNoGo: An Efficient LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Streamlining Automotive Software Release Decision-Making,"Arsham Gholamzadeh Khoee, Yinan Yu, Robert Feldt, Andris Freimanis, Patrick Andersson Rhodin, Dhasarathy Parthasarathy","Traditional methods for making software deployment decisions in the automotive industry typically rely on manual analysis of tabular software test data. These methods often lead to higher costs and delays in the software release cycle due to their labor-intensive nature. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution to these challenges. However, their application generally demands multiple rounds of human-driven prompt engineering, which limits their practical deployment, particularly for industrial end-users who need reliable and efficient results. In this paper, we propose GoNoGo, an LLM agent system designed to streamline automotive software deployment while meeting both functional requirements and practical industrial constraints. Unlike previous systems, GoNoGo is specifically tailored to address domain-specific and risk-sensitive systems. We evaluate GoNoGo's performance across different task difficulties using zero-shot and few-shot examples taken from industrial practice. Our results show that GoNoGo achieves a 100% success rate for tasks up to Level 2 difficulty with 3-shot examples, and maintains high performance even for more complex tasks. We find that GoNoGo effectively automates decision-making for simpler tasks, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. In summary, GoNoGo represents an efficient and user-friendly LLM-based solution currently employed in our industrial partner's company to assist with software release decision-making, supporting more informed and timely decisions in the release process for risk-sensitive vehicle systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09785v2,2024-08
Summarizing long regulatory documents with a multi-step pipeline,"Mika Sie, Ruby Beek, Michiel Bots, Sjaak Brinkkemper, Albert Gatt","Due to their length and complexity, long regulatory texts are challenging to summarize. To address this, a multi-step extractive-abstractive architecture is proposed to handle lengthy regulatory documents more effectively. In this paper, we show that the effectiveness of a two-step architecture for summarizing long regulatory texts varies significantly depending on the model used. Specifically, the two-step architecture improves the performance of decoder-only models. For abstractive encoder-decoder models with short context lengths, the effectiveness of an extractive step varies, whereas for long-context encoder-decoder models, the extractive step worsens their performance. This research also highlights the challenges of evaluating generated texts, as evidenced by the differing results from human and automated evaluations. Most notably, human evaluations favoured language models pretrained on legal text, while automated metrics rank general-purpose language models higher. The results underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate summarization strategy based on model architecture and context length.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09777v2,2024-08
Are Large Language Models More Honest in Their Probabilistic or Verbalized Confidence?,"Shiyu Ni, Keping Bi, Lulu Yu, Jiafeng Guo","Large language models (LLMs) have been found to produce hallucinations when the question exceeds their internal knowledge boundaries. A reliable model should have a clear perception of its knowledge boundaries, providing correct answers within its scope and refusing to answer when it lacks knowledge. Existing research on LLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries typically uses either the probability of the generated tokens or the verbalized confidence as the model's confidence in its response. However, these studies overlook the differences and connections between the two. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and comparison of LLMs' probabilistic perception and verbalized perception of their factual knowledge boundaries. First, we investigate the pros and cons of these two perceptions. Then, we study how they change under questions of varying frequencies. Finally, we measure the correlation between LLMs' probabilistic confidence and verbalized confidence. Experimental results show that 1) LLMs' probabilistic perception is generally more accurate than verbalized perception but requires an in-domain validation set to adjust the confidence threshold. 2) Both perceptions perform better on less frequent questions. 3) It is challenging for LLMs to accurately express their internal confidence in natural language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09773v1,2024-08
Strategic Demonstration Selection for Improved Fairness in LLM In-Context Learning,"Jingyu Hu, Weiru Liu, Mengnan Du","Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of using in-context learning (ICL) to steer large language models (LLMs) in processing tabular data, a challenging task given the structured nature of such data. Despite advancements in performance, the fairness implications of these methods are less understood. This study investigates how varying demonstrations within ICL prompts influence the fairness outcomes of LLMs. Our findings reveal that deliberately including minority group samples in prompts significantly boosts fairness without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Further experiments demonstrate that the proportion of minority to majority samples in demonstrations affects the trade-off between fairness and prediction accuracy. Based on these insights, we introduce a mitigation technique that employs clustering and evolutionary strategies to curate a diverse and representative sample set from the training data. This approach aims to enhance both predictive performance and fairness in ICL applications. Experimental results validate that our proposed method dramatically improves fairness across various metrics, showing its efficacy in real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09757v1,2024-08
R2GenCSR: Retrieving Context Samples for Large Language Model based X-ray Medical Report Generation,"Xiao Wang, Yuehang Li, Fuling Wang, Shiao Wang, Chuanfu Li, Bo Jiang","Inspired by the tremendous success of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing X-ray medical report generation methods attempt to leverage large models to achieve better performance. They usually adopt a Transformer to extract the visual features of a given X-ray image, and then, feed them into the LLM for text generation. How to extract more effective information for the LLMs to help them improve final results is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Additionally, the use of visual Transformer models also brings high computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel context-guided efficient X-ray medical report generation framework. Specifically, we introduce the Mamba as the vision backbone with linear complexity, and the performance obtained is comparable to that of the strong Transformer model. More importantly, we perform context retrieval from the training set for samples within each mini-batch during the training phase, utilizing both positively and negatively related samples to enhance feature representation and discriminative learning. Subsequently, we feed the vision tokens, context information, and prompt statements to invoke the LLM for generating high-quality medical reports. Extensive experiments on three X-ray report generation datasets (i.e., IU-Xray, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert Plus) fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Paired Completion: Flexible Quantification of Issue-framing at Scale with LLMs,"Simon D Angus, Lachlan O'Neill","Detecting and quantifying issue framing in textual discourse - the perspective one takes to a given topic (e.g. climate science vs. denialism, misogyny vs. gender equality) - is highly valuable to a range of end-users from social and political scientists to program evaluators and policy analysts. However, conceptual framing is notoriously challenging for automated natural language processing (NLP) methods since the words and phrases used by either `side' of an issue are often held in common, with only subtle stylistic flourishes separating their use. Here we develop and rigorously evaluate new detection methods for issue framing and narrative analysis within large text datasets. By introducing a novel application of next-token log probabilities derived from generative large language models (LLMs) we show that issue framing can be reliably and efficiently detected in large corpora with only a few examples of either perspective on a given issue, a method we call `paired completion'. Through 192 independent experiments over three novel, synthetic datasets, we evaluate paired completion against prompt-based LLM methods and labelled methods using traditional NLP and recent LLM contextual embeddings. We additionally conduct a cost-based analysis to mark out the feasible set of performant methods at production-level scales, and a model bias analysis. Together, our work demonstrates a feasible path to scalable, accurate and low-bias issue-framing in large corpora.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09742v1,2024-08
Pedestrian Attribute Recognition: A New Benchmark Dataset and A Large Language Model Augmented Framework,"Jiandong Jin, Xiao Wang, Qian Zhu, Haiyang Wang, Chenglong Li","Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is one of the indispensable tasks in human-centered research. However, existing datasets neglect different domains (e.g., environments, times, populations, and data sources), only conducting simple random splits, and the performance of these datasets has already approached saturation. In the past five years, no large-scale dataset has been opened to the public. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new large-scale, cross-domain pedestrian attribute recognition dataset to fill the data gap, termed MSP60K. It consists of 60,122 images and 57 attribute annotations across eight scenarios. Synthetic degradation is also conducted to further narrow the gap between the dataset and real-world challenging scenarios. To establish a more rigorous benchmark, we evaluate 17 representative PAR models under both random and cross-domain split protocols on our dataset. Additionally, we propose an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) augmented PAR framework, named LLM-PAR. This framework processes pedestrian images through a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to extract features and introduces a multi-embedding query Transformer to learn partial-aware features for attribute classification. Significantly, we enhance this framework with LLM for ensemble learning and visual feature augmentation. Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly validated the efficacy of our proposed framework. The dataset and source code accompanying this paper will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09720v1,2024-08
SEMDR: A Semantic-Aware Dual Encoder Model for Legal Judgment Prediction with Legal Clue Tracing,"Pengjie Liu, Wang Zhang, Yulong Ding, Xuefeng Zhang, Shuang-Hua Yang","Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to form legal judgments based on the criminal fact description. However, researchers struggle to classify confusing criminal cases, such as robbery and theft, which requires LJP models to distinguish the nuances between similar crimes. Existing methods usually design handcrafted features to pick up necessary semantic legal clues to make more accurate legal judgment predictions. In this paper, we propose a Semantic-Aware Dual Encoder Model (SEMDR), which designs a novel legal clue tracing mechanism to conduct fine-grained semantic reasoning between criminal facts and instruments. Our legal clue tracing mechanism is built from three reasoning levels: 1) Lexicon-Tracing, which aims to extract criminal facts from criminal descriptions; 2) Sentence Representation Learning, which contrastively trains language models to better represent confusing criminal facts; 3) Multi-Fact Reasoning, which builds a reasons graph to propagate semantic clues among fact nodes to capture the subtle difference among criminal facts. Our legal clue tracing mechanism helps SEMDR achieve state-of-the-art on the CAIL2018 dataset and shows its advance in few-shot scenarios. Our experiments show that SEMDR has a strong ability to learn more uniform and distinguished representations for criminal facts, which helps to make more accurate predictions on confusing criminal cases and reduces the model uncertainty during making judgments.

Bridging the Language Gap: Enhancing Multilingual Prompt-Based Code Generation in LLMs via Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer,"Mingda Li, Abhijit Mishra, Utkarsh Mujumdar","The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for program code generation has gained substantial attention, but their biases and limitations with non-English prompts challenge global inclusivity. This paper investigates the complexities of multilingual prompt-based code generation. Our evaluations of LLMs, including CodeLLaMa and CodeGemma, reveal significant disparities in code quality for non-English prompts; we also demonstrate the inadequacy of simple approaches like prompt translation, bootstrapped data augmentation, and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a zero-shot cross-lingual approach using a neural projection technique, integrating a cross-lingual encoder like LASER artetxe2019massively to map multilingual embeddings from it into the LLM's token space. This method requires training only on English data and scales effectively to other languages. Results on a translated and quality-checked MBPP dataset show substantial improvements in code quality. This research promotes a more inclusive code generation landscape by empowering LLMs with multilingual capabilities to support the diverse linguistic spectrum in programming.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09701v1,2024-08
"Recording for Eyes, Not Echoing to Ears: Contextualized Spoken-to-Written Conversion of ASR Transcripts","Jiaqing Liu, Chong Deng, Qinglin Zhang, Shilin Zhou, Qian Chen, Hai Yu, Wen Wang","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts exhibit recognition errors and various spoken language phenomena such as disfluencies, ungrammatical sentences, and incomplete sentences, hence suffering from poor readability. To improve readability, we propose a Contextualized Spoken-to-Written conversion (CoS2W) task to address ASR and grammar errors and also transfer the informal text into the formal style with content preserved, utilizing contexts and auxiliary information. This task naturally matches the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate comprehensive comparisons of various LLMs, we construct a document-level Spoken-to-Written conversion of ASR Transcripts Benchmark (SWAB) dataset. Using SWAB, we study the impact of different granularity levels on the CoS2W performance, and propose methods to exploit contexts and auxiliary information to enhance the outputs. Experimental results reveal that LLMs have the potential to excel in the CoS2W task, particularly in grammaticality and formality, our methods achieve effective understanding of contexts and auxiliary information by LLMs. We further investigate the effectiveness of using LLMs as evaluators and find that LLM evaluators show strong correlations with human evaluations on rankings of faithfulness and formality, which validates the reliability of LLM evaluators for the CoS2W task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09688v3,2024-08

Merrill, Jeffrey Heer, Tim Althoff","Data-driven scientific discovery requires the iterative integration of scientific domain knowledge, statistical expertise, and an understanding of data semantics to make nuanced analytical decisions, e.g., about which variables, transformations, and statistical models to consider. LM-based agents equipped with planning, memory, and code execution capabilities have the potential to support data-driven science. However, evaluating agents on such open-ended tasks is challenging due to multiple valid approaches, partially correct steps, and different ways to express the same decisions. To address these challenges, we present BLADE, a benchmark to automatically evaluate agents' multifaceted approaches to open-ended research questions. BLADE consists of 12 datasets and research questions drawn from existing scientific literature, with ground truth collected from independent analyses by expert data scientists and researchers. To automatically evaluate agent responses, we developed corresponding computational methods to match different representations of analyses to this ground truth. Though language models possess considerable world knowledge, our evaluation shows that they are often limited to basic analyses. However, agents capable of interacting with the underlying data demonstrate improved, but still non-optimal, diversity in their analytical decision making. Our work enables the evaluation of agents for data-driven science and provides researchers deeper insights into agents' analysis approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09667v2,2024-08
A Comparison of Large Language Model and Human Performance on Random Number Generation Tasks,Rachel M. Harrison,"Random Number Generation Tasks (RNGTs) are used in psychology for examining how humans generate sequences devoid of predictable patterns. By adapting an existing human RNGT for an LLM-compatible environment, this preliminary study tests whether ChatGPT-3.5, a large language model (LLM) trained on human-generated text, exhibits human-like cognitive biases when generating random number sequences. Initial findings indicate that ChatGPT-3.5 more effectively avoids repetitive and sequential patterns compared to humans, with notably lower repeat frequencies and adjacent number frequencies. Continued research into different models, parameters, and prompting methodologies will deepen our understanding of how LLMs can more closely mimic human random generation behaviors, while also broadening their applications in cognitive and behavioral science research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09656v2,2024-08
ELDER: Enhancing Lifelong Model Editing with Mixture-of-LoRA,"Jiaang Li, Quan Wang, Zhongnan Wang, Yongdong Zhang, Zhendong Mao","Large language models (LLMs) require model editing to efficiently update specific knowledge within them and avoid factual errors. Most model editing methods are solely designed for single-time use and result in a significant forgetting effect in lifelong editing scenarios, where sequential edits are conducted over time. Previous approaches manage sequential edits by freezing original parameters and discretely allocating new parameters for each knowledge update. However, these methods lack robustness to minor input variations due to the discrete mapping between data and parameters. To overcome this challenge, we propose ELDER, a novel approach to create a continuous association between data and adapters. ELDER integrates multiple LoRAs through a router network and is trained to establish a smooth data-adapter association, thereby enhancing the edit robustness and generalization of semantically equivalent inputs. To ensure inputs containing the same knowledge will be processed by the same LoRAs, we design a novel loss to guide the model link LoRA allocations with edit knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a deferral mechanism to retain the original LLM capabilities post-edit. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 XL and LLaMA2-7B demonstrate that ELDER effectively edits models in the lifelong setting, outperforming eight baselines while exhibiting strong scalability and preserving LLMs' general abilities on downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11869v2,2024-08

The paper evaluates the method using a Q\&A dataset from an online shopping website and eight expert models.

Acquiring Bidirectionality via Large and Small Language Models,"Takumi Goto, Hiroyoshi Nagao, Yuta Koreeda","Using token representation from bidirectional language models (LMs) such as BERT is still a widely used approach for token-classification tasks. Even though there exist much larger unidirectional LMs such as Llama-2, they are rarely used to replace the token representation of bidirectional LMs. In this work, we hypothesize that their lack of bidirectionality is keeping them behind. To that end, we propose to newly train a small backward LM and concatenate its representations to those of existing LM for downstream tasks. Through experiments in named entity recognition, we demonstrate that introducing backward model improves the benchmark performance more than 10 points. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method is especially effective for rare domains and in few-shot learning settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09640v2,2024-08
How to Make the Most of LLMs' Grammatical Knowledge for Acceptability Judgments,"Yusuke Ide, Yuto Nishida, Miyu Oba, Yusuke Sakai, Justin Vasselli, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe","The grammatical knowledge of language models (LMs) is often measured using a benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs, where LMs are presented with a pair of acceptable and unacceptable sentences and required to judge which is acceptable. The existing dominant approach, however, naively calculates and compares the probabilities of paired sentences using LMs. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have yet to be thoroughly examined in this field. We thus investigate how to make the most of LLMs' grammatical knowledge to comprehensively evaluate it. Through extensive experiments of nine judgment methods in English and Chinese, we demonstrate that a probability readout method, in-template LP, and a prompting-based method, Yes/No probability computing, achieve particularly high performance, surpassing the conventional approach. Our analysis reveals their different strengths, e.g., Yes/No probability computing is robust against token-length bias, suggesting that they harness different aspects of LLMs' grammatical knowledge. Consequently, we recommend using diverse judgment methods to evaluate LLMs comprehensively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09639v1,2024-08
MoDeGPT: Modular Decomposition for Large Language Model Compression,"Chi-Heng Lin, Shangqian Gao, James Seale Smith, Abhishek Patel, Shikhar Tuli, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Yen-Chang Hsu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\""om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09632v3,2024-08
A Strategy to Combine 1stGen Transformers and Open LLMs for Automatic Text Classification,"Claudio M. V. de Andrade, Washington Cunha, Davi Reis, Adriana Silvina Pagano, Leonardo Rocha, Marcos André Gonçalves","Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results, with Large Language Models (LLMs), an evolution of first-generation transformers (1stTR), being considered the cutting edge in several NLP tasks. However, the literature has yet to conclusively demonstrate that LLMs consistently outperform 1stTRs across all NLP tasks. This study compares three 1stTRs (BERT, RoBERTa, and BART) with two open LLMs (Llama 2 and Bloom) across 11 sentiment analysis datasets. The results indicate that open LLMs may moderately outperform or match 1stTRs in 8 out of 11 datasets but only when fine-tuned. Given this substantial cost for only moderate gains, the practical applicability of these models in cost-sensitive scenarios is questionable. In this context, a confidence-based strategy that seamlessly integrates 1stTRs with open LLMs based on prediction certainty is proposed. High-confidence documents are classified by the more cost-effective 1stTRs, while uncertain cases are handled by LLMs in zero-shot or few-shot modes, at a much lower cost than fine-tuned versions. Experiments in sentiment analysis demonstrate that our solution not only outperforms 1stTRs, zero-shot, and few-shot LLMs but also competes closely with fine-tuned LLMs at a fraction of the cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09629v1,2024-08
Refining Packing and Shuffling Strategies for Enhanced Performance in Generative Language Models,"Yanbing Chen, Ruilin Wang, Zihao Yang, Lavender Yao Jiang, Eric Karl Oermann","Packing and shuffling tokens is a common practice in training auto-regressive language models (LMs) to prevent overfitting and improve efficiency. Typically documents are concatenated to chunks of maximum sequence length (MSL) and then shuffled. However setting the atom size, the length for each data chunk accompanied by random shuffling, to MSL may lead to contextual incoherence due to tokens from different documents being packed into the same chunk. An alternative approach is to utilize padding, another common data packing strategy, to avoid contextual incoherence by only including one document in each shuffled chunk. To optimize both packing strategies (concatenation vs padding), we investigated the optimal atom size for shuffling and compared their performance and efficiency. We found that matching atom size to MSL optimizes performance for both packing methods (concatenation and padding), and padding yields lower final perplexity (higher performance) than concatenation at the cost of more training steps and lower compute efficiency. This trade-off informs the choice of packing methods in training language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09621v1,2024-08

Grammatical Error Feedback: An Implicit Evaluation Approach,"Stefano Bannò, Kate Knill, Mark J. F. Gales","Grammatical feedback is crucial for consolidating second language (L2) learning. Most research in computer-assisted language learning has focused on feedback through grammatical error correction (GEC) systems, rather than examining more holistic feedback that may be more useful for learners. This holistic feedback will be referred to as grammatical error feedback (GEF). In this paper, we present a novel implicit evaluation approach to GEF that eliminates the need for manual feedback annotations. Our method adopts a grammatical lineup approach where the task is to pair feedback and essay representations from a set of possible alternatives. This matching process can be performed by appropriately prompting a large language model (LLM).

HiAgent: Hierarchical Working Memory Management for Solving Long-Horizon Agent Tasks with Large Language Model,"Mengkang Hu, Tianxing Chen, Qiguang Chen, Yao Mu, Wenqi Shao, Ping Luo","Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents exhibit significant potential across various domains, operating as interactive systems that process environmental observations to generate executable actions for target tasks. The effectiveness of these agents is significantly influenced by their memory mechanism, which records historical experiences as sequences of action-observation pairs. We categorize memory into two types: cross-trial memory, accumulated across multiple attempts, and in-trial memory (working memory), accumulated within a single attempt. While considerable research has optimized performance through cross-trial memory, the enhancement of agent performance through improved working memory utilization remains underexplored. Instead, existing approaches often involve directly inputting entire historical action-observation pairs into LLMs, leading to redundancy in long-horizon tasks. Inspired by human problem-solving strategies, this paper introduces HiAgent, a framework that leverages subgoals as memory chunks to manage the working memory of LLM-based agents hierarchically. Specifically, HiAgent prompts LLMs to formulate subgoals before generating executable actions and enables LLMs to decide proactively to replace previous subgoals with summarized observations, retaining only the action-observation pairs relevant to the current subgoal. Experimental results across five long-horizon tasks demonstrate that HiAgent achieves a twofold increase in success rate and reduces the average number of steps required by 3.8. Additionally, our analysis shows that HiAgent consistently improves performance across various steps, highlighting its robustness and generalizability.

To contribute to this question, we first argue that neither humans nor LLMs are general learners, in a variety of senses. We make a novel case for how in particular LLMs follow a dual-optimization process: they are optimized during their training (which is typically compared to language acquisition), and modern LLMs have also been selected, through a process akin to natural selection in a species. From this perspective, we argue that the performance of LLMs, whether similar or dissimilar to that of humans, does not weigh easily on important debates about the importance of human cognitive biases for language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09544v2,2024-08
Using ChatGPT to Score Essays and Short-Form Constructed Responses,Mark D. Shermis,"This study aimed to determine if ChatGPT's large language models could match the scoring accuracy of human and machine scores from the ASAP competition. The investigation focused on various prediction models, including linear regression, random forest, gradient boost, and boost. ChatGPT's performance was evaluated against human raters using quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) metrics. Results indicated that while ChatGPT's gradient boost model achieved QWKs close to human raters for some data sets, its overall performance was inconsistent and often lower than human scores. The study highlighted the need for further refinement, particularly in handling biases and ensuring scoring fairness. Despite these challenges, ChatGPT demonstrated potential for scoring efficiency, especially with domain-specific fine-tuning. The study concludes that ChatGPT can complement human scoring but requires additional development to be reliable for high-stakes assessments. Future research should improve model accuracy, address ethical considerations, and explore hybrid models combining ChatGPT with empirical methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09540v1,2024-08

Out-of-distribution generalization via composition: a lens through induction heads in Transformers,"Jiajun Song, Zhuoyan Xu, Yiqiao Zhong","Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 sometimes appear to be creative, solving novel tasks often with a few demonstrations in the prompt. These tasks require the models to generalize on distributions different from those from training data -- which is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach OOD generalization remains an open and underexplored question. We examine OOD generalization in settings where instances are generated according to hidden rules, including in-context learning with symbolic reasoning. Models are required to infer the hidden rules behind input prompts without any fine-tuning.   We empirically examined the training dynamics of Transformers on a synthetic example and conducted extensive experiments on a variety of pretrained LLMs, focusing on a type of components known as induction heads. We found that OOD generalization and composition are tied together -- models can learn rules by composing two self-attention layers, thereby achieving OOD generalization. Furthermore, a shared latent subspace in the embedding (or feature) space acts as a bridge for composition by aligning early layers and later layers, which we refer to as the common bridge representation hypothesis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09503v2,2024-08
REFINE-LM: Mitigating Language Model Stereotypes via Reinforcement Learning,"Rameez Qureshi, Naïm Es-Sebbani, Luis Galárraga, Yvette Graham, Miguel Couceiro, Zied Bouraoui","With the introduction of (large) language models, there has been significant concern about the unintended bias such models may inherit from their training data. A number of studies have shown that such models propagate gender stereotypes, as well as geographical and racial bias, among other biases. While existing works tackle this issue by preprocessing data and debiasing embeddings, the proposed methods require a lot of computational resources and annotation effort while being limited to certain types of biases. To address these issues, we introduce REFINE-LM, a debiasing method that uses reinforcement learning to handle different types of biases without any fine-tuning. By training a simple model on top of the word probability distribution of a LM, our bias agnostic reinforcement learning method enables model debiasing without human annotations or significant computational resources. Experiments conducted on a wide range of models, including several LMs, show that our method (i) significantly reduces stereotypical biases while preserving LMs performance; (ii) is applicable to different types of biases, generalizing across contexts such as gender, ethnicity, religion, and nationality-based biases; and (iii) it is not expensive to train.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09489v1,2024-08
Activated Parameter Locating via Causal Intervention for Model Merging,"Fanshuang Kong, Richong Zhang, Ziqiao Wang","Model merging combines multiple homologous models into one model, achieving convincing generalization without the necessity of additional training. A key challenge in this problem is resolving parameter redundancies and conflicts across multiple models. Existing models have demonstrated that dropping a portion of delta parameters can alleviate conflicts while maintaining performance. However, these methods often drop parameters either randomly or based on magnitude, overlooking task-specific information embedded in fine-tuned models. In this paper, we propose an Activated Parameter Locating (APL) method that utilizes causal intervention to estimate parameter importance, enabling more precise parameter drops and better conflict mitigation. Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity associated with a large number of parameter partitions, we also introduce a theoretically supported gradient approximation strategy for APL. Experiments on model merging within both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, along with associated analyses, showcase the effectiveness of APL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09485v1,2024-08
PanoSent: A Panoptic Sextuple Extraction Benchmark for Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Meng Luo, Hao Fei, Bobo Li, Shengqiong Wu, Qian Liu, Soujanya Poria, Erik Cambria, Mong-Li Lee, Wynne Hsu","While existing Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has received extensive effort and advancement, there are still gaps in defining a more holistic research target seamlessly integrating multimodality, conversation context, fine-granularity, and also covering the changing sentiment dynamics as well as cognitive causal rationales. This paper bridges the gaps by introducing a multimodal conversational ABSA, where two novel subtasks are proposed: 1) Panoptic Sentiment Sextuple Extraction, panoramically recognizing holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, rationale from multi-turn multi-party multimodal dialogue. 2) Sentiment Flipping Analysis, detecting the dynamic sentiment transformation throughout the conversation with the causal reasons. To benchmark the tasks, we construct PanoSent, a dataset annotated both manually and automatically, featuring high quality, large scale, multimodality, multilingualism, multi-scenarios, and covering both implicit and explicit sentiment elements. To effectively address the tasks, we devise a novel Chain-of-Sentiment reasoning framework, together with a novel multimodal large language model (namely Sentica) and a paraphrase-based verification mechanism. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our methods over strong baselines, validating the efficacy of all our proposed methods. The work is expected to open up a new era for the ABSA community, and thus all our codes and data are open at https://PanoSent.github.io/",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09481v2,2024-08
Image-Based Geolocation Using Large Vision-Language Models,"Yi Liu, Junchen Ding, Gelei Deng, Yuekang Li, Tianwei Zhang, Weisong Sun, Yaowen Zheng, Jingquan Ge, Yang Liu","Geolocation is now a vital aspect of modern life, offering numerous benefits but also presenting serious privacy concerns. The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) with advanced image-processing capabilities introduces new risks, as these models can inadvertently reveal sensitive geolocation information. This paper presents the first in-depth study analyzing the challenges posed by traditional deep learning and LVLM-based geolocation methods. Our findings reveal that LVLMs can accurately determine geolocations from images, even without explicit geographic training.   To address these challenges, we introduce \tool{}, an innovative framework that significantly enhances image-based geolocation accuracy. \tool{} employs a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) approach, mimicking human geoguessing strategies by carefully analyzing visual and contextual cues such as vehicle types, architectural styles, natural landscapes, and cultural elements. Extensive testing on a dataset of 50,000 ground-truth data points shows that \tool{} outperforms both traditional models and human benchmarks in accuracy. It achieves an impressive average score of 4550.5 in the GeoGuessr game, with an 85.37\% win rate, and delivers highly precise geolocation predictions, with the closest distances as accurate as 0.3 km. Furthermore, our study highlights issues related to dataset integrity, leading to the creation of a more robust dataset and a refined framework that leverages LVLMs' cognitive capabilities to improve geolocation precision. These findings underscore \tool{}'s superior ability to interpret complex visual data, the urgent need to address emerging security vulnerabilities posed by LVLMs, and the importance of responsible AI development to ensure user privacy protection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09474v1,2024-08
WPN: An Unlearning Method Based on N-pair Contrastive Learning in Language Models,"Guitao Chen, Yunshen Wang, Hongye Sun, Guang Chen","Generative language models (LMs) offer numerous advantages but may produce inappropriate or harmful outputs due to the harmful knowledge acquired during pre-training. This knowledge often manifests as undesirable correspondences, such as ""harmful prompts"" leading to ""harmful outputs,"" which our research aims to mitigate through unlearning techniques.However, existing unlearning methods based on gradient ascent can significantly impair the performance of LMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Weighted Positional N-pair (WPN) Learning, which leverages position-weighted mean pooling within an n-pair contrastive learning framework. WPN is designed to modify the output distribution of LMs by eliminating specific harmful outputs (e.g., replacing toxic responses with neutral ones), thereby transforming the model's behavior from ""harmful prompt-harmful output"" to ""harmful prompt-harmless response"".Experiments on OPT and GPT-NEO LMs show that WPN effectively reduces the proportion of harmful responses, achieving a harmless rate of up to 95.8\% while maintaining stable performance on nine common benchmarks (with less than 2\% degradation on average). Moreover, we provide empirical evidence to demonstrate WPN's ability to weaken the harmful correspondences in terms of generalizability and robustness, as evaluated on out-of-distribution test sets and under adversarial attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09459v1,2024-08
Identifying Speakers and Addressees of Quotations in Novels with Prompt Learning,"Yuchen Yan, Hanjie Zhao, Senbin Zhu, Hongde Liu, Zhihong Zhang, Yuxiang Jia","Quotations in literary works, especially novels, are important to create characters, reflect character relationships, and drive plot development. Current research on quotation extraction in novels primarily focuses on quotation attribution, i.e., identifying the speaker of the quotation. However, the addressee of the quotation is also important to construct the relationship between the speaker and the addressee. To tackle the problem of dataset scarcity, we annotate the first Chinese quotation corpus with elements including speaker, addressee, speaking mode and linguistic cue. We propose prompt learning-based methods for speaker and addressee identification based on fine-tuned pre-trained models. Experiments on both Chinese and English datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which outperform methods based on zero-shot and few-shot large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09452v1,2024-08
Retrieval-Augmented Generation Meets Data-Driven Tabula Rasa Approach for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting,"Geethan Sannidhi, Sagar Srinivas Sakhinana, Venkataramana Runkana","Pre-trained large language models (PLLMs) like OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Gemini face challenges such as inaccurate factual recall, hallucinations, biases, and future data leakage for temporal Knowledge Graph (tKG) forecasting. To address these issues, we introduce sLA-tKGF (small-scale language assistant for tKG forecasting), which utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aided, custom-trained small-scale language models through a tabula rasa approach from scratch for effective tKG forecasting. Our framework constructs knowledge-infused prompts with relevant historical data from tKGs, web search results, and PLLMs-generated textual descriptions to understand historical entity relationships prior to the target time. It leverages these external knowledge-infused prompts for deeper understanding and reasoning of context-specific semantic and temporal information to zero-shot prompt small-scale language models for more accurate predictions of future events within tKGs. It reduces hallucinations and mitigates distributional shift challenges through comprehending changing trends over time. As a result, it enables more accurate and contextually grounded forecasts of future events while minimizing computational demands. Rigorous empirical studies demonstrate our framework robustness, scalability, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmark datasets with interpretable and trustworthy tKG forecasting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13273v1,2024-08
Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Time Series Analysis,"Chidaksh Ravuru, Sagar Srinivas Sakhinana, Venkataramana Runkana","Time series modeling is crucial for many applications, however, it faces challenges such as complex spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution shifts in learning from historical context to predict task-specific outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach using an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for time series analysis. The framework leverages a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture where the master agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents and delegates the end-user request to the relevant sub-agent. The sub-agents utilize smaller, pre-trained language models (SLMs) customized for specific time series tasks through fine-tuning using instruction tuning and direct preference optimization, and retrieve relevant prompts from a shared repository of prompt pools containing distilled knowledge about historical patterns and trends to improve predictions on new data. Our proposed modular, multi-agent RAG approach offers flexibility and achieves state-of-the-art performance across major time series tasks by tackling complex challenges more effectively than task-specific customized methods across benchmark datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14484v1,2024-08

HySem: A context length optimized LLM pipeline for unstructured tabular extraction,"Narayanan PP, Anantharaman Palacode Narayana Iyer","Regulatory compliance reporting in the pharmaceutical industry relies on detailed tables, but these are often under-utilized beyond compliance due to their unstructured format and arbitrary content. Extracting and semantically representing tabular data is challenging due to diverse table presentations. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial potential for semantic representation, yet they encounter challenges related to accuracy and context size limitations, which are crucial considerations for the industry applications. We introduce HySem, a pipeline that employs a novel context length optimization technique to generate accurate semantic JSON representations from HTML tables. This approach utilizes a custom fine-tuned model specifically designed for cost- and privacy-sensitive small and medium pharmaceutical enterprises. Running on commodity hardware and leveraging open-source models, HySem surpasses its peer open-source models in accuracy and provides competitive performance when benchmarked against OpenAI GPT-4o and effectively addresses context length limitations, which is a crucial factor for supporting larger tables.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09434v2,2024-08

Existing methods either have high latency due to recomputation of input representations, or fall behind of offline ST in translation quality. In this paper, we propose FASST, a fast large language model based method for streaming speech translation. We propose blockwise-causal speech encoding and consistency mask, so that streaming speech input can be encoded incrementally without recomputation. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training strategy to optimize FASST for simultaneous inference. We evaluate FASST and multiple strong prior models on MuST-C dataset. Experiment results show that FASST achieves the best quality-latency trade-off.

"Reefknot: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Relation Hallucination Evaluation, Analysis and Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models","Kening Zheng, Junkai Chen, Yibo Yan, Xin Zou, Xuming Hu","Hallucination issues continue to affect multimodal large language models (MLLMs), with existing research mainly addressing object-level or attribute-level hallucinations, neglecting the more complex relation hallucinations that require advanced reasoning. Current benchmarks for relation hallucinations lack detailed evaluation and effective mitigation, and their datasets often suffer from biases due to systematic annotation processes. To address these challenges, we introduce Reefknot, a comprehensive benchmark targeting relation hallucinations, comprising over 20,000 real-world samples. We provide a systematic definition of relation hallucinations, integrating perceptive and cognitive perspectives, and construct a relation-based corpus using the Visual Genome scene graph dataset. Our comparative evaluation reveals significant limitations in current MLLMs' ability to handle relation hallucinations. Additionally, we propose a novel confidence-based mitigation strategy, which reduces the hallucination rate by an average of 9.75% across three datasets, including Reefknot. Our work offers valuable insights for achieving trustworthy multimodal intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09429v2,2024-08
Distinguish Confusion in Legal Judgment Prediction via Revised Relation Knowledge,"Nuo Xu, Pinghui Wang, Junzhou Zhao, Feiyang Sun, Lin Lan, Jing Tao, Li Pan, Xiaohong Guan","Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to automatically predict a law case's judgment results based on the text description of its facts. In practice, the confusing law articles (or charges) problem frequently occurs, reflecting that the law cases applicable to similar articles (or charges) tend to be misjudged. Although some recent works based on prior knowledge solve this issue well, they ignore that confusion also occurs between law articles with a high posterior semantic similarity due to the data imbalance problem instead of only between the prior highly similar ones, which is this work's further finding. This paper proposes an end-to-end model named \textit{D-LADAN} to solve the above challenges. On the one hand, D-LADAN constructs a graph among law articles based on their text definition and proposes a graph distillation operation (GDO) to distinguish the ones with a high prior semantic similarity. On the other hand, D-LADAN presents a novel momentum-updated memory mechanism to dynamically sense the posterior similarity between law articles (or charges) and a weighted GDO to adaptively capture the distinctions for revising the inductive bias caused by the data imbalance problem. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate that D-LADAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09422v1,2024-08

To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a novel approach using GraphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital.

Comparison between the Structures of Word Co-occurrence and Word Similarity Networks for Ill-formed and Well-formed Texts in Taiwan Mandarin,"Po-Hsuan Huang, Hsuan-Lei Shao","The study of word co-occurrence networks has attracted the attention of researchers due to their potential significance as well as applications. Understanding the structure of word co-occurrence networks is therefore important to fully realize their significance and usages. In past studies, word co-occurrence networks built on well-formed texts have been found to possess certain characteristics, including being small-world, following a two-regime power law distribution, and being generally disassortative. On the flip side, past studies have found that word co-occurrence networks built from ill-formed texts such as microblog posts may behave differently from those built from well-formed documents. While both kinds of word co-occurrence networks are small-world and disassortative, word co-occurrence networks built from ill-formed texts are scale-free and follow the power law distribution instead of the two-regime power law distribution. However, since past studies on the behavior of word co-occurrence networks built from ill-formed texts only investigated English, the universality of such characteristics remains to be seen among different languages. In addition, it is yet to be investigated whether there could be possible similitude/differences between word co-occurrence networks and other potentially comparable networks. This study therefore investigates and compares the structure of word co-occurrence networks and word similarity networks based on Taiwan Mandarin ill-formed internet forum posts and compare them with those built with well-formed judicial judgments, and seeks to find out whether the three aforementioned properties (scale-free, small-world, and disassortative) for ill-formed and well-formed texts are universal among different languages and between word co-occurrence and word similarity networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09404v1,2024-08
Game Development as Human-LLM Interaction,"Jiale Hong, Hongqiu Wu, Hai Zhao","Game development is a highly specialized task that relies on a complex game engine powered by complex programming languages, preventing many gaming enthusiasts from handling it. This paper introduces the Chat Game Engine (ChatGE) powered by LLM, which allows everyone to develop a custom game using natural language through Human-LLM interaction. To enable an LLM to function as a ChatGE, we instruct it to perform the following processes in each turn: (1) $P_{script}$: configure the game script segment based on the user's input; (2) $P_{code}$: generate the corresponding code snippet based on the game script segment; (3) $P_{utter}$: interact with the user, including guidance and feedback. We propose a data synthesis pipeline based on LLM to generate game script-code pairs and interactions from a few manually crafted seed data. We propose a three-stage progressive training strategy to transfer the dialogue-based LLM to our ChatGE smoothly. We construct a ChatGE for poker games as a case study and comprehensively evaluate it from two perspectives: interaction quality and code correctness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09386v2,2024-08
Reward Difference Optimization For Sample Reweighting In Offline RLHF,"Shiqi Wang, Zhengze Zhang, Rui Zhao, Fei Tan, Cam Tu Nguyen","With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the ""ordinal relationship"" between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of how much one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a difference model which captures rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09385v2,2024-08

This paper presents a robust framework for aligning LLMs with online communities via instruction-tuning and comprehensively evaluating alignment across various aspects of language, including authenticity, emotional tone, toxicity, and harm. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to online communities centered on dieting and body image.

Concept Distillation from Strong to Weak Models via Hypotheses-to-Theories Prompting,"Emmanuel Aboah Boateng, Cassiano O. Becker, Nabiha Asghar, Kabir Walia, Ashwin Srinivasan, Ehi Nosakhare, Victor Dibia, Soundar Srinivasan","Hand-crafting high quality prompts to optimize the performance of language models is a complicated and labor-intensive process. Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09365v1,2024-08

However, LLMs still struggle to generate natural and colloquial responses in real-world applications such as chatbots and psychological counseling that require more human-like interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce NICO, a Natural Interactive COnversation dataset in Chinese. We first use GPT-4-turbo to generate dialogue drafts and make them cover 20 daily-life topics and 5 types of social interactions. Then, we hire workers to revise these dialogues to ensure that they are free of grammatical errors and unnatural utterances. We define two dialogue-level natural conversation tasks and two sentence-level tasks for identifying and rewriting unnatural sentences.

Threshold Filtering Packing for Supervised Fine-Tuning: Training Related Samples within Packs,"Jiancheng Dong, Lei Jiang, Wei Jin, Lu Cheng","Packing for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in autoregressive models involves concatenating data points of varying lengths until reaching the designed maximum length to facilitate GPU processing. However, randomly concatenating data points and feeding them into an autoregressive transformer can lead to cross-contamination of sequences due to the significant difference in their subject matter. The mainstream approaches in SFT ensure that each token in the attention calculation phase only focuses on tokens within its own short sequence, without providing additional learning signals for the preceding context. To address these challenges, we introduce Threshold Filtering Packing (TFP), a method that selects samples with related context while maintaining sufficient diversity within the same pack. Our experiments show that TFP offers a simple-to-implement and scalable approach that significantly enhances SFT performance, with observed improvements of up to 7\% on GSM8K, 4\% on HumanEval, and 15\% on the adult-census-income dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09327v1,2024-08
Characterizing and Evaluating the Reliability of LLMs against Jailbreak Attacks,"Kexin Chen, Yi Liu, Dongxia Wang, Jiaying Chen, Wenhai Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly become pivotal in content generation with notable societal impact. These models hold the potential to generate content that could be deemed harmful.Efforts to mitigate this risk include implementing safeguards to ensure LLMs adhere to social ethics.However, despite such measures, the phenomenon of ""jailbreaking"" -- where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models -- persists as a significant challenge. Recognizing the continuous threat posed by jailbreaking tactics and their repercussions for the trustworthy use of LLMs, a rigorous assessment of the models' robustness against such attacks is essential. This study introduces an comprehensive evaluation framework and conducts an large-scale empirical experiment to address this need. We concentrate on 10 cutting-edge jailbreak strategies across three categories, 1525 questions from 61 specific harmful categories, and 13 popular LLMs. We adopt multi-dimensional metrics such as Attack Success Rate (ASR), Toxicity Score, Fluency, Token Length, and Grammatical Errors to thoroughly assess the LLMs' outputs under jailbreak. By normalizing and aggregating these metrics, we present a detailed reliability score for different LLMs, coupled with strategic recommendations to reduce their susceptibility to such vulnerabilities. Additionally, we explore the relationships among the models, attack strategies, and types of harmful content, as well as the correlations between the evaluation metrics, which proves the validity of our multifaceted evaluation framework. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate a lack of resilience among all tested LLMs against certain strategies, and highlight the need to concentrate on the reliability facets of LLMs. We believe our study can provide valuable insights into enhancing the security evaluation of LLMs against jailbreak within the domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09326v1,2024-08

Sohel Rahman, Rifat Shahriyar","Cross-lingual summarization (CLS) is a sophisticated branch in Natural Language Processing that demands models to accurately translate and summarize articles from different source languages. Despite the improvement of the subsequent studies, This area still needs data-efficient solutions along with effective training methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, there is no feasible solution for CLS when there is no available high-quality CLS data. In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient approach, ConVerSum, for CLS leveraging the power of contrastive learning, generating versatile candidate summaries in different languages based on the given source document and contrasting these summaries with reference summaries concerning the given documents. After that, we train the model with a contrastive ranking loss. Then, we rigorously evaluate the proposed approach against current methodologies and compare it to powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)- Gemini, GPT 3.5, and GPT 4o proving our model performs better for low-resource languages' CLS. These findings represent a substantial improvement in the area, opening the door to more efficient and accurate cross-lingual summarizing techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09273v2,2024-08
How Susceptible are LLMs to Influence in Prompts?,"Sotiris Anagnostidis, Jannis Bulian","Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompts, including additional context provided therein. As LLMs grow in capability, understanding their prompt-sensitivity becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring reliable and robust performance, particularly since evaluating these models becomes more challenging. In this work, we investigate how current models (Llama, Mixtral, Falcon) respond when presented with additional input from another model, mimicking a scenario where a more capable model -- or a system with access to more external information -- provides supplementary information to the target model. Across a diverse spectrum of question-answering tasks, we study how an LLM's response to multiple-choice questions changes when the prompt includes a prediction and explanation from another model. Specifically, we explore the influence of the presence of an explanation, the stated authoritativeness of the source, and the stated confidence of the supplementary input. Our findings reveal that models are strongly influenced, and when explanations are provided they are swayed irrespective of the quality of the explanation. The models are more likely to be swayed if the input is presented as being authoritative or confident, but the effect is small in size. This study underscores the significant prompt-sensitivity of LLMs and highlights the potential risks of incorporating outputs from external sources without thorough scrutiny and further validation. As LLMs continue to advance, understanding and mitigating such sensitivities will be crucial for their reliable and trustworthy deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11865v1,2024-08
Reference-Guided Verdict: LLMs-as-Judges in Automatic Evaluation of Free-Form Text,"Sher Badshah, Hassan Sajjad","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as chat assistants capable of generating human-like conversations has amplified the need for robust evaluation methods, particularly for open-ended tasks. Conventional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, while useful, are increasingly inadequate for capturing the subtle semantics and contextual richness of such generative outputs. We propose a reference-guided verdict method that automates the evaluation process by leveraging multiple LLMs-as-judges. Through experiments on three open-ended question-answering tasks, we demonstrate that combining multiple LLMs-as-judges significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of evaluations, particularly in complex tasks where a single model might struggle. Our findings reveal a strong correlation with human evaluations, establishing our method as a viable and effective alternative to traditional metrics and human judgments, particularly in the context of LLM-based chat assistants where the complexity and diversity of responses challenge existing benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09235v2,2024-08
Unraveling Text Generation in LLMs: A Stochastic Differential Equation Approach,Yukun Zhang,"This paper explores the application of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) to interpret the text generation process of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Text generation in LLMs is modeled as a stochastic process where each step depends on previously generated content and model parameters, sampling the next word from a vocabulary distribution. We represent this generation process using SDE to capture both deterministic trends and stochastic perturbations. The drift term describes the deterministic trends in the generation process, while the diffusion term captures the stochastic variations. We fit these functions using neural networks and validate the model on real-world text corpora. Through numerical simulations and comprehensive analyses, including drift and diffusion analysis, stochastic process property evaluation, and phase space exploration, we provide deep insights into the dynamics of text generation. This approach not only enhances the understanding of the inner workings of LLMs but also offers a novel mathematical perspective on language generation, which is crucial for diagnosing, optimizing, and controlling the quality of generated text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11863v1,2024-08
Generating Data with Text-to-Speech and Large-Language Models for Conversational Speech Recognition,"Samuele Cornell, Jordan Darefsky, Zhiyao Duan, Shinji Watanabe","Currently, a common approach in many speech processing tasks is to leverage large scale pre-trained models by fine-tuning them on in-domain data for a particular application. Yet obtaining even a small amount of such data can be problematic, especially for sensitive domains and conversational speech scenarios, due to both privacy issues and annotation costs. To address this, synthetic data generation using single speaker datasets has been employed. Yet, for multi-speaker cases, such an approach often requires extensive manual effort and is prone to domain mismatches. In this work, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for multi-speaker conversational ASR, leveraging a large language model (LLM) for content creation and a conversational multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) model for speech synthesis. We conduct evaluation by fine-tuning the Whisper ASR model for telephone and distant conversational speech settings, using both in-domain data and generated synthetic data. Our results show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform classical multi-speaker generation approaches that use external, non-conversational speech datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09215v1,2024-08

The evaluated system leverages advanced techniques to fine-tune a model to generate discharge summaries from short-hand inputs, including voice, text, and electronic health record data.

Chinese Metaphor Recognition Using a Multi-stage Prompting Large Language Model,"Jie Wang, Jin Wang, Xuejie Zhang","Metaphors are common in everyday language, and the identification and understanding of metaphors are facilitated by models to achieve a better understanding of the text. Metaphors are mainly identified and generated by pre-trained models in existing research, but situations, where tenors or vehicles are not included in the metaphor, cannot be handled. The problem can be effectively solved by using Large Language Models (LLMs), but significant room for exploration remains in this early-stage research area. A multi-stage generative heuristic-enhanced prompt framework is proposed in this study to enhance the ability of LLMs to recognize tenors, vehicles, and grounds in Chinese metaphors. In the first stage, a small model is trained to obtain the required confidence score for answer candidate generation. In the second stage, questions are clustered and sampled according to specific rules. Finally, the heuristic-enhanced prompt needed is formed by combining the generated answer candidates and demonstrations. The proposed model achieved 3rd place in Track 1 of Subtask 1, 1st place in Track 2 of Subtask 1, and 1st place in both tracks of Subtask 2 at the NLPCC-2024 Shared Task 9.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09177v1,2024-08
Cognitive LLMs: Towards Integrating Cognitive Architectures and Large Language Models for Manufacturing Decision-making,"Siyu Wu, Alessandro Oltramari, Jonathan Francis, C. Lee Giles, Frank E. Ritter","Resolving the dichotomy between the human-like yet constrained reasoning processes of Cognitive Architectures and the broad but often noisy inference behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a challenging but exciting pursuit, for enabling reliable machine reasoning capabilities in production systems. Because Cognitive Architectures are famously developed for the purpose of modeling the internal mechanisms of human cognitive decision-making at a computational level, new investigations consider the goal of informing LLMs with the knowledge necessary for replicating such processes, e.g., guided perception, memory, goal-setting, and action. Previous approaches that use LLMs for grounded decision-making struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require slower, deliberate cognition over fast and intuitive inference -- reporting issues related to the lack of sufficient grounding, as in hallucination. To resolve these challenges, we introduce LLM-ACTR, a novel neuro-symbolic architecture that provides human-aligned and versatile decision-making by integrating the ACT-R Cognitive Architecture with LLMs. Our framework extracts and embeds knowledge of ACT-R's internal decision-making process as latent neural representations, injects this information into trainable LLM adapter layers, and fine-tunes the LLMs for downstream prediction. Our experiments on novel Design for Manufacturing tasks show both improved task performance as well as improved grounded decision-making capability of our approach, compared to LLM-only baselines that leverage chain-of-thought reasoning strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09176v1,2024-08
TableBench: A Comprehensive and Complex Benchmark for Table Question Answering,"Xianjie Wu, Jian Yang, Linzheng Chai, Ge Zhang, Jiaheng Liu, Xinrun Du, Di Liang, Daixin Shu, Xianfu Cheng, Tianzhen Sun, Guanglin Niu, Tongliang Li, Zhoujun Li","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have markedly enhanced the interpretation and processing of tabular data, introducing previously unimaginable capabilities. Despite these achievements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges when applied in industrial scenarios, particularly due to the increased complexity of reasoning required with real-world tabular data, underscoring a notable disparity between academic benchmarks and practical applications. To address this discrepancy, we conduct a detailed investigation into the application of tabular data in industrial scenarios and propose a comprehensive and complex benchmark TableBench, including 18 fields within four major categories of table question answering (TableQA) capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce TableLLM, trained on our meticulously constructed training set TableInstruct, achieving comparable performance with GPT-3.5. Massive experiments conducted on TableBench indicate that both open-source and proprietary LLMs still have significant room for improvement to meet real-world demands, where the most advanced model, GPT-4, achieves only a modest score compared to humans.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09174v1,2024-08
Unc-TTP: A Method for Classifying LLM Uncertainty to Improve In-Context Example Selection,"Hsiu-Yuan Huang, Zichen Wu, Yutong Yang, Junzhao Zhang, Yunfang Wu","Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various downstream tasks. However, it is challenging for users to discern whether the responses are generated with certainty or are fabricated to meet user expectations. Estimating the uncertainty of LLMs is particularly challenging due to their vast scale and the lack of white-box access. In this work, we propose a novel Uncertainty Tripartite Testing Paradigm (Unc-TTP) to classify LLM uncertainty, via evaluating the consistency of LLM outputs when incorporating label interference into the sampling-based approach. Based on Unc-TTP outputs, we aggregate instances into certain and uncertain categories. Further, we conduct a detailed analysis of the uncertainty properties of LLMs and show Unc-TTP's superiority over the existing sampling-based methods. In addition, we leverage the obtained uncertainty information to guide in-context example selection, demonstrating that Unc-TTP obviously outperforms retrieval-based and sampling-based approaches in selecting more informative examples. Our work paves a new way to classify the uncertainty of both open- and closed-source LLMs, and introduces a practical approach to exploit this uncertainty to improve LLMs performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09172v3,2024-08

In this paper, we have conducted a survey on the use of automatic metrics, focusing particularly on natural language generation (NLG) tasks. We inspect which metrics are used as well as why they are chosen and how their use is reported.

CogLM: Tracking Cognitive Development of Large Language Models,"Xinglin Wang, Peiwen Yuan, Shaoxiong Feng, Yiwei Li, Boyuan Pan, Heda Wang, Yao Hu, Kan Li","Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development (PTC) posits that the development of cognitive levels forms the foundation for human learning across various abilities. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable abilities across a wide variety of tasks, we are curious about the cognitive levels of current LLMs: to what extent they have developed and how this development has been achieved. To this end, we construct a benchmark CogLM (Cognitive Ability Evaluation for Language Model) based on PTC to assess the cognitive levels of LLMs. CogLM comprises 1,220 questions spanning 10 cognitive abilities crafted by more than 20 human experts, providing a comprehensive testbed for the cognitive levels of LLMs. Through extensive experiments across multiple mainstream LLMs with CogLM, we find that: (1) Human-like cognitive abilities have emerged in advanced LLMs (GPT-4), comparable to those of a 20-year-old human. (2) The parameter size and optimization objective are two key factors affecting the cognitive levels of LLMs. (3) The performance on downstream tasks is positively correlated with the level of cognitive abilities. These findings fill the gap in research on the cognitive abilities of LLMs, tracing the development of LLMs from a cognitive perspective and guiding the future direction of their evolution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09150v1,2024-08
Selective Prompt Anchoring for Code Generation,"Yuan Tian, Tianyi Zhang","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as Copilot and ChatGPT have transformed software development by automating coding tasks. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in reducing error rates and fully meeting user expectations. Our empirical study reveals LLMs tend to dilute their self-attention on the initial prompt as more code tokens are generated. We hypothesize this self-attention dilution issue is one of the root causes of inaccuracies in LLM-generated code. To mitigate this issue, we propose Selective Prompt Anchoring (SPA). SPA amplifies the influence of the selected parts in the initial prompt, which we refer to as ``anchored text'', during code generation. Specifically, SPA calculates the logit distribution difference with and without the anchored text. We prove this difference approximates the anchored text's contextual contribution to the output logits. SPA creates an augmented logit distribution by linearly combining the original logit distribution and the logit difference. We evaluate SPA with five LLMs on four benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that using SPA can consistently improve Pass@1 rates by up to 9.7% in all settings. Notably, with selective text anchoring, a small version of DeepSeek-Coder (6.7B) can achieve better performance than an original much larger version (33B). Our code is available at https://github.com/magic-YuanTian/Selective-Prompt-Anchoring.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09121v2,2024-08
Measuring Agreeableness Bias in Multimodal Models,"Jaehyuk Lim, Bruce W.

Our study employs a systematic methodology to investigate this effect: we present models with images of multiple-choice questions, which they initially answer correctly, then expose the same model to versions with pre-marked options. Our findings reveal a significant shift in the models' responses towards the pre-marked option, even when it contradicts their answers in the neutral settings. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that this agreeableness bias is a consistent and quantifiable behavior across various model architectures. These results show potential limitations in the reliability of these models when processing images with pre-marked options, raising important questions about their application in critical decision-making contexts where such visual cues might be present.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09111v2,2024-08

We find that including definitions for rare words improves performance by up to 1.0 BLEU and 1.6 MacroF1.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09075v2,2024-08
CodeTaxo: Enhancing Taxonomy Expansion with Limited Examples via Code Language Prompts,"Qingkai Zeng, Yuyang Bai, Zhaoxuan Tan, Zhenyu Wu, Shangbin Feng, Meng Jiang","Taxonomies play a crucial role in various applications by providing a structural representation of knowledge. The task of taxonomy expansion involves integrating emerging concepts into existing taxonomies by identifying appropriate parent concepts for these new query concepts. Previous approaches typically relied on self-supervised methods that generate annotation data from existing taxonomies. However, these methods are less effective when the existing taxonomy is small (fewer than 100 entities). In this work, we introduce \textsc{CodeTaxo}, a novel approach that leverages large language models through code language prompts to capture the taxonomic structure. Extensive experiments on five real-world benchmarks from different domains demonstrate that \textsc{CodeTaxo} consistently achieves superior performance across all evaluation metrics, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

We compared the results to understand how each tool categorizes and describes individual reflections and multiple reflections as a whole. This study aims to explore ways to bridge the gaps between qualitative, quantitative, and computational analyses of reflective practices in teacher education. This study finds that to effectively integrate LLM analysis into teacher education, developing an analysis method and result format that are both comprehensive and relevant for preservice teachers and teacher educators is crucial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11862v1,2024-08
Learning to Route for Dynamic Adapter Composition in Continual Learning with Language Models,"Vladimir Araujo, Marie-Francine Moens, Tinne Tuytelaars","Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are increasingly used with pre-trained language models (PLMs) for continual learning (CL). These methods typically involve training a PEFT module for each new task and employing similarity-based selection to route modules during inference. However, they face two major limitations: 1) interference during module training with already learned modules and 2) suboptimal routing when composing modules. In this paper, we present L2R, a method that isolates the training of new PEFT modules to ensure their task specialization. L2R then learns to compose the learned modules by training a network of routers that leverages a small memory containing examples of previously seen tasks. We evaluate our method in two CL setups using various benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that L2R provides an effective composition of PEFT modules, leading to improved generalization and performance compared to other methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09053v2,2024-08
Language Models Show Stable Value Orientations Across Diverse Role-Plays,"Bruce W. Lee, Yeongheon Lee, Hyunsoo Cho","We demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) exhibit consistent value orientations despite adopting diverse personas, revealing a persistent inertia in their responses that remains stable across the variety of roles they are prompted to assume. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we introduce the role-play-at-scale methodology, which involves prompting LLMs with randomized, diverse personas and analyzing the macroscopic trend of their responses. Unlike previous works that simply feed these questions to LLMs as if testing human subjects, our role-play-at-scale methodology diagnoses inherent tendencies in a systematic and scalable manner by: (1) prompting the model to act in different random personas and (2) asking the same question multiple times for each random persona. This approach reveals consistent patterns in LLM responses across diverse role-play scenarios, indicating deeply encoded inherent tendencies. Our findings contribute to the discourse on value alignment in foundation models and demonstrate the efficacy of role-play-at-scale as a diagnostic tool for uncovering encoded biases in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09049v1,2024-08
"Improving VTE Identification through Language Models from Radiology Reports: A Comparative Study of Mamba, Phi-3 Mini, and BERT","Jamie Deng, Yusen Wu, Yelena Yesha, Phuong Nguyen","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a critical cardiovascular condition, encompassing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Accurate and timely identification of VTE is essential for effective medical care. This study builds upon our previous work, which addressed VTE detection using deep learning methods for DVT and a hybrid approach combining deep learning and rule-based classification for PE. Our earlier approaches, while effective, had two major limitations: they were complex and required expert involvement for feature engineering of the rule set. To overcome these challenges, we utilize the Mamba architecture-based classifier. This model achieves remarkable results, with a 97\% accuracy and F1 score on the DVT dataset and a 98\% accuracy and F1 score on the PE dataset. In contrast to the previous hybrid method on PE identification, the Mamba classifier eliminates the need for hand-engineered rules, significantly reducing model complexity while maintaining comparable performance. Additionally, we evaluated a lightweight Large Language Model (LLM), Phi-3 Mini, in detecting VTE. While this model delivers competitive results, outperforming the baseline BERT models, it proves to be computationally intensive due to its larger parameter set. Our evaluation shows that the Mamba-based model demonstrates superior performance and efficiency in VTE identification, offering an effective solution to the limitations of previous approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09043v1,2024-08

Speaking the Same Language: Leveraging LLMs in Standardizing Clinical Data for AI,"Arindam Sett, Somaye Hashemifar, Mrunal Yadav, Yogesh Pandit, Mohsen Hejrati","The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the healthcare industry has garnered considerable attention, attributable to its prospective enhancement of clinical outcomes, expansion of access to superior healthcare, cost reduction, and elevation of patient satisfaction. Nevertheless, the primary hurdle that persists is related to the quality of accessible multi-modal healthcare data in conjunction with the evolution of AI methodologies. This study delves into the adoption of large language models to address specific challenges, specifically, the standardization of healthcare data. We advocate the use of these models to identify and map clinical data schemas to established data standard attributes, such as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. Our results illustrate that employing large language models significantly diminishes the necessity for manual data curation and elevates the efficacy of the data standardization process. Consequently, the proposed methodology has the propensity to expedite the integration of AI in healthcare, ameliorate the quality of patient care, whilst minimizing the time and financial resources necessary for the preparation of data for AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11861v1,2024-08
Adaptive Uncertainty Quantification for Generative AI,"Jungeum Kim, Sean O'Hagan, Veronika Rockova","This work is concerned with conformal prediction in contemporary applications (including generative AI) where a black-box model has been trained on data that are not accessible to the user. Mirroring split-conformal inference, we design a wrapper around a black-box algorithm which calibrates conformity scores. This calibration is local and proceeds in two stages by first adaptively partitioning the predictor space into groups and then calibrating sectionally group by group. Adaptive partitioning (self-grouping) is achieved by fitting a robust regression tree to the conformity scores on the calibration set. This new tree variant is designed in such a way that adding a single new observation does not change the tree fit with overwhelmingly large probability. This add-one-in robustness property allows us to conclude a finite sample group-conditional coverage guarantee, a refinement of the marginal guarantee. In addition, unlike traditional split-conformal inference, adaptive splitting and within-group calibration yields adaptive bands which can stretch and shrink locally. We demonstrate benefits of local tightening on several simulated as well as real examples using non-parametric regression. Finally, we consider two contemporary classification applications for obtaining uncertainty quantification around GPT-4o predictions. We conformalize skin disease diagnoses based on self-reported symptoms as well as predicted states of U.S. legislators based on summaries of their ideology. We demonstrate substantial local tightening of the uncertainty sets while attaining similar marginal coverage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08990v1,2024-08
From Lazy to Prolific: Tackling Missing Labels in Open Vocabulary Extreme Classification by Positive-Unlabeled Sequence Learning,"Ranran Haoran Zhang, Bensu Uçar, Soumik Dey, Hansi Wu, Binbin Li, Rui Zhang","Open-vocabulary Extreme Multi-label Classification (OXMC) extends traditional XMC by allowing prediction beyond an extremely large, predefined label set (typically $10^3$ to $10^{12}$ labels), addressing the dynamic nature of real-world labeling tasks. However, self-selection bias in data annotation leads to significant missing labels in both training and test data, particularly for less popular inputs. This creates two critical challenges: generation models learn to be ""lazy'"" by under-generating labels, and evaluation becomes unreliable due to insufficient annotation in the test set. In this work, we introduce Positive-Unlabeled Sequence Learning (PUSL), which reframes OXMC as an infinite keyphrase generation task, addressing the generation model's laziness. Additionally, we propose to adopt a suite of evaluation metrics, F1@$\mathcal{O}$ and newly proposed B@$k$, to reliably assess OXMC models with incomplete ground truths. In a highly imbalanced e-commerce dataset with substantial missing labels, PUSL generates 30% more unique labels, and 72% of its predictions align with actual user queries. On the less skewed EURLex-4.3k dataset, PUSL demonstrates superior F1 scores, especially as label counts increase from 15 to 30. Our approach effectively tackles both the modeling and evaluation challenges in OXMC with missing labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08981v3,2024-08
See What LLMs Cannot Answer: A Self-Challenge Framework for Uncovering LLM Weaknesses,"Yulong Chen, Yang Liu, Jianhao Yan, Xuefeng Bai, Ming Zhong, Yinghao Yang, Ziyi Yang, Chenguang Zhu, Yue Zhang","The impressive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has consistently surpassed numerous human-designed benchmarks, presenting new challenges in assessing the shortcomings of LLMs. Designing tasks and finding LLMs' limitations are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we investigate the question of whether an LLM can discover its own limitations from the errors it makes. To this end, we propose a Self-Challenge evaluation framework with human-in-the-loop. Starting from seed instances that GPT-4 fails to answer, we prompt GPT-4 to summarize error patterns that can be used to generate new instances and incorporate human feedback on them to refine these patterns for generating more challenging data, iteratively. We end up with 8 diverse patterns, such as text manipulation and questions with assumptions. We then build a benchmark, SC-G4, consisting of 1,835 instances generated by GPT-4 using these patterns, with human-annotated gold responses. The SC-G4 serves as a challenging benchmark that allows for a detailed assessment of LLMs' abilities. Our results show that only 44.96\% of instances in SC-G4 can be answered correctly by GPT-4. Interestingly, our pilot study indicates that these error patterns also challenge other LLMs, such as Claude-3 and Llama-3, and cannot be fully resolved through fine-tuning. Our work takes the first step to demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously identify their inherent flaws and provide insights for future dynamic and automatic evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08978v2,2024-08
SEAL: Systematic Error Analysis for Value ALignment,"Manon Revel, Matteo Cargnelutti, Tyna Eloundou, Greg Leppert","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aims to align language models (LMs) with human values by training reward models (RMs) on binary preferences and using these RMs to fine-tune the base LMs. Despite its importance, the internal mechanisms of RLHF remain poorly understood. This paper introduces new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of modeling and aligning human values, namely feature imprint, alignment resistance and alignment robustness. We categorize alignment datasets into target features (desired values) and spoiler features (undesired concepts). By regressing RM scores against these features, we quantify the extent to which RMs reward them - a metric we term feature imprint. We define alignment resistance as the proportion of the preference dataset where RMs fail to match human preferences, and we assess alignment robustness by analyzing RM responses to perturbed inputs. Our experiments, utilizing open-source components like the Anthropic/hh-rlhf preference dataset and OpenAssistant RMs, reveal significant imprints of target features and a notable sensitivity to spoiler features. We observed a 26% incidence of alignment resistance in portions of the dataset where LM-labelers disagreed with human preferences. Furthermore, we find that misalignment often arises from ambiguous entries within the alignment dataset. These findings underscore the importance of scrutinizing both RMs and alignment datasets for a deeper understanding of value alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10270v1,2024-08

We address this limitation by introducing BnSentMix, a sentiment analysis dataset on code-mixed Bengali consisting of 20,000 samples with 4 sentiment labels from Facebook, YouTube, and e-commerce sites. We ensure diversity in data sources to replicate realistic code-mixed scenarios. Additionally, we propose 14 baseline methods including novel transformer encoders further pre-trained on code-mixed Bengali-English, achieving an overall accuracy of 69.8% and an F1 score of 69.1% on sentiment classification tasks. Detailed analyses reveal variations in performance across different sentiment labels and text types, highlighting areas for future improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08964v3,2024-08
Adaptive Guardrails For Large Language Models via Trust Modeling and In-Context Learning,"Jinwei Hu, Yi Dong, Xiaowei Huang","Guardrails have become an integral part of Large language models (LLMs), by moderating harmful or toxic response in order to maintain LLMs' alignment to human expectations. However, the existing guardrail methods do not consider different needs and access rights of individual users, and treat all the users with the same rule. This study introduces an adaptive guardrail mechanism, supported by trust modeling and enhanced with in-context learning, to dynamically modulate access to sensitive content based on user trust metrics. By leveraging a combination of direct interaction trust and authority-verified trust, the system precisely tailors the strictness of content moderation to align with the user's credibility and the specific context of their inquiries. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the adaptive guardrail effectively meets diverse user needs, outperforming existing guardrails in practicality while securing sensitive information and precisely managing potentially hazardous content through a context-aware knowledge base. This work is the first to introduce trust-oriented concept within a guardrail system, offering a scalable solution that enriches the discourse on ethical deployment for next-generation LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08959v1,2024-08

PEDAL: Enhancing Greedy Decoding with Large Language Models using Diverse Exemplars,Sumanth Prabhu,"Self-ensembling techniques with diverse reasoning paths such as Self-Consistency have demonstrated remarkable performance gains in text generation with Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such techniques depend on the availability of an accurate answer extraction process to aggregate across multiple outputs. Moreover, they acquire higher inference cost, in comparison to Greedy Decoding, due to generation of relatively higher number of output tokens. Research has shown that the free form text outputs from Self-Consistency can be aggregated reliably using LLMs to produce the final output. Additionally, recent advancements in LLM inference have demonstrated that usage of diverse exemplars in prompts have the ability to induce diversity in the LLM outputs. Such proven techniques can be easily extended to self-ensembling based approaches to achieve enhanced results in text generation. In this paper, we introduce PEDAL (Prompts based on Exemplar Diversity Aggregated using LLMs), a hybrid self-ensembling approach, that combines the strengths of diverse exemplar based prompts and LLM based aggregation to achieve improvement in overall performance. On the publicly available SVAMP and ARC datasets, our experiments reveal that PEDAL can achieve better accuracy than Greedy Decoding based strategies with lower inference cost compared to Self Consistency based approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08869v2,2024-08
Risks and NLP Design: A Case Study on Procedural Document QA,"Nikita Haduong, Alice Gao, Noah A. Smith","As NLP systems are increasingly deployed at scale, concerns about their potential negative impacts have attracted the attention of the research community, yet discussions of risk have mostly been at an abstract level and focused on generic AI or NLP applications. We argue that clearer assessments of risks and harms to users--and concrete strategies to mitigate them--will be possible when we specialize the analysis to more concrete applications and their plausible users. As an illustration, this paper is grounded in cooking recipe procedural document question answering (ProcDocQA), where there are well-defined risks to users such as injuries or allergic reactions. Our case study shows that an existing language model, applied in ""zero-shot"" mode, quantitatively answers real-world questions about recipes as well or better than the humans who have answered the questions on the web. Using a novel questionnaire informed by theoretical work on AI risk, we conduct a risk-oriented error analysis that could then inform the design of a future system to be deployed with lower risk of harm and better performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11860v1,2024-08

FLEXTAF: Enhancing Table Reasoning with Flexible Tabular Formats,"Xuanliang Zhang, Dingzirui Wang, Longxu Dou, Baoxin Wang, Dayong Wu, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che","The table reasoning task aims to answer the question according to the given table. Currently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) is the predominant method for table reasoning. Most existing methods employ a fixed tabular format to represent the table, which could limit the performance. Given that each instance requires different capabilities and models possess varying abilities, we assert that different instances and models suit different tabular formats. We prove the aforementioned claim through quantitative analysis of experimental results, where different instances and models achieve different performances using various tabular formats. Building on this discussion, we propose FLEXTAF-Single and FLEXTAF-Vote to enhance table reasoning performance by employing flexible tabular formats. Specifically, (i) FLEXTAF-Single trains a classifier to predict the most suitable tabular format based on the instance and the LLM. (ii) FLEXTAF-Vote integrates the results across different formats. Our experiments on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact reveal significant improvements, with average gains of 2.3% and 4.8% compared to the best performance achieved using a fixed tabular format with greedy decoding and self-consistency decoding, thereby validating the effectiveness of our methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08841v2,2024-08
CIKMar: A Dual-Encoder Approach to Prompt-Based Reranking in Educational Dialogue Systems,"Joanito Agili Lopo, Marina Indah Prasasti, Alma Permatasari","In this study, we introduce CIKMar, an efficient approach to educational dialogue systems powered by the Gemma Language model. By leveraging a Dual-Encoder ranking system that incorporates both BERT and SBERT model, we have designed CIKMar to deliver highly relevant and accurate responses, even with the constraints of a smaller language model size. Our evaluation reveals that CIKMar achieves a robust recall and F1-score of 0.70 using BERTScore metrics. However, we have identified a significant challenge: the Dual-Encoder tends to prioritize theoretical responses over practical ones. These findings underscore the potential of compact and efficient models like Gemma in democratizing access to advanced educational AI systems, ensuring effective and contextually appropriate responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08805v1,2024-08
FourierKAN outperforms MLP on Text Classification Head Fine-tuning,"Abdullah Al Imran, Md Farhan Ishmam","In resource constraint settings, adaptation to downstream classification tasks involves fine-tuning the final layer of a classifier (i.e. classification head) while keeping rest of the model weights frozen. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) heads fine-tuned with pre-trained transformer backbones have long been the de facto standard for text classification head fine-tuning. However, the fixed non-linearity of MLPs often struggles to fully capture the nuances of contextual embeddings produced by pre-trained models, while also being computationally expensive. In our work, we investigate the efficacy of KAN and its variant, Fourier KAN (FR-KAN), as alternative text classification heads. Our experiments reveal that FR-KAN significantly outperforms MLPs with an average improvement of 10% in accuracy and 11% in F1-score across seven pre-trained transformer models and four text classification tasks. Beyond performance gains, FR-KAN is more computationally efficient and trains faster with fewer parameters. These results underscore the potential of FR-KAN to serve as a lightweight classification head, with broader implications for advancing other Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08803v2,2024-08
EmoDynamiX: Emotional Support Dialogue Strategy Prediction by Modelling MiXed Emotions and Discourse Dynamics,"Chenwei Wan, Matthieu Labeau, Chloé Clavel","Designing emotionally intelligent conversational systems to provide comfort and advice to people experiencing distress is a compelling area of research. Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without explicit strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, implicit strategy planning lacks transparency, and recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction framework, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user fine-grained emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for better performance and transparency. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias). Our approach also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08782v2,2024-08
Evaluating the Evaluator: Measuring LLMs' Adherence to Task Evaluation Instructions,"Bhuvanashree Murugadoss, Christian Poelitz, Ian Drosos, Vu Le, Nick McKenna, Carina Suzana Negreanu, Chris Parnin, Advait Sarkar","LLMs-as-a-judge is a recently popularized method which replaces human judgements in task evaluation (Zheng et al. 2024) with automatic evaluation using LLMs. Due to widespread use of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT4 and Llama3 are expected to have strong alignment with human preferences when prompted for a quality judgement, such as the coherence of a text. While this seems beneficial, it is not clear whether the assessments by an LLM-as-a-judge constitute only an evaluation based on the instructions in the prompts, or reflect its preference for high-quality data similar to its fine-tune data. To investigate how much influence prompting the LLMs-as-a-judge has on the alignment of AI judgements to human judgements, we analyze prompts with increasing levels of instructions about the target quality of an evaluation, for several LLMs-as-a-judge. Further, we compare to a prompt-free method using model perplexity as a quality measure instead. We aggregate a taxonomy of quality criteria commonly used across state-of-the-art evaluations with LLMs and provide this as a rigorous benchmark of models as judges. Overall, we show that the LLMs-as-a-judge benefit only little from highly detailed instructions in prompts and that perplexity can sometimes align better with human judgements than prompting, especially on textual quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08781v1,2024-08
Large Language Models Might Not Care What You Are Saying: Prompt Format Beats Descriptions,"Chenming Tang, Zhixiang Wang, Yunfang Wu","With the help of in-context learning (ICL), large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various tasks. However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL perfromance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not necessarily care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since the framework could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble prompt on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions. Our code will be publicly available once this paper is published.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08780v3,2024-08
DAC: Decomposed Automation Correction for Text-to-SQL,"Dingzirui Wang, Longxu Dou, Xuanliang Zhang, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che","Text-to-SQL is an important task that helps people obtain information from databases by automatically generating SQL queries. Considering the brilliant performance, approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) become the mainstream for text-to-SQL. Among these approaches, automated correction is an effective approach that further enhances performance by correcting the mistakes in the generated results. The existing correction methods require LLMs to directly correct with generated SQL, while previous research shows that LLMs do not know how to detect mistakes, leading to poor performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to employ the decomposed correction to enhance text-to-SQL performance. We first demonstrate that decomposed correction outperforms direct correction since detecting and fixing mistakes with the results of the decomposed sub-tasks is easier than with SQL. Based on this analysis, we introduce Decomposed Automation Correction (DAC), which corrects SQL by decomposing text-to-SQL into entity linking and skeleton parsing. DAC first generates the entity and skeleton corresponding to the question and then compares the differences between the initial SQL and the generated entities and skeleton as feedback for correction. Experimental results show that our method improves performance by $3.7\%$ on average of Spider, Bird, and KaggleDBQA compared with the baseline method, demonstrating the effectiveness of DAC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08779v2,2024-08
Lower Layer Matters: Alleviating Hallucination via Multi-Layer Fusion Contrastive Decoding with Truthfulness Refocused,"Dingwei Chen, Feiteng Fang, Shiwen Ni, Feng Liang, Ruifeng Xu, Min Yang, Chengming Li","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various natural language processing tasks, yet they occasionally tend to yield content that factually inaccurate or discordant with the expected output, a phenomenon empirically referred to as ""hallucination"". To tackle this issue, recent works have investigated contrastive decoding between the original model and an amateur model with induced hallucination, which has shown promising results. Nonetheless, this method may undermine the output distribution of the original LLM caused by its coarse contrast and simplistic subtraction operation, potentially leading to errors in certain cases. In this paper, we introduce a novel contrastive decoding framework termed LOL (LOwer Layer Matters). Our approach involves concatenating the contrastive decoding of both the final and lower layers between the original model and the amateur model, thereby achieving multi-layer fusion to aid in the mitigation of hallucination. Additionally, we incorporate a truthfulness refocused module that leverages contextual guidance to enhance factual encoding, further capturing truthfulness during contrastive decoding. Extensive experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets illustrate that our proposed LOL framework can substantially alleviate hallucination while surpassing existing baselines in most cases. Compared with the best baseline, we improve by average 4.5 points on all metrics of TruthfulQA. The source code is coming soon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08769v1,2024-08
ConcateNet: Dialogue Separation Using Local And Global Feature Concatenation,"Mhd Modar Halimeh, Matteo Torcoli, Emanuël Habets","Dialogue separation involves isolating a dialogue signal from a mixture, such as a movie or a TV program. This can be a necessary step to enable dialogue enhancement for broadcast-related applications. In this paper, ConcateNet for dialogue separation is proposed, which is based on a novel approach for processing local and global features aimed at better generalization for out-of-domain signals. ConcateNet is trained using a noise reduction-focused, publicly available dataset and evaluated using three datasets: two noise reduction-focused datasets (in-domain), which show competitive performance for ConcateNet, and a broadcast-focused dataset (out-of-domain), which verifies the better generalization performance for the proposed architecture compared to considered state-of-the-art noise-reduction methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08729v1,2024-08
ChatZero:Zero-shot Cross-Lingual Dialogue Generation via Pseudo-Target Language,"Yongkang Liu, Feng Shi, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang, Hinrich Schütze","Although large language models(LLMs) show amazing capabilities, among various exciting applications discovered for LLMs fall short in other low-resource languages. Besides, most existing methods depend on large-scale dialogue corpora and thus building systems for dialogue generation in a zero-shot scenario remains a considerable challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end zero-shot dialogue generation model ChatZero based on cross-lingual code-switching method. First, we construct code-switching language and pseudo-target language with placeholders. Then for cross-lingual semantic transfer, we employ unsupervised contrastive learning to minimize the semantics gap of the source language, code-switching language, and pseudo-target language that are mutually positive examples in the high dimensional semantic space. Experiments on the multilingual DailyDialog and DSTC7-AVSD datasets demonstrate that ChatZero can achieve more than 90\% of the original performance under the zero-shot case compared to supervised learning, and achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with other baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08724v1,2024-08
Turning Trash into Treasure: Accelerating Inference of Large Language Models with Token Recycling,"Xianzhen Luo, Yixuan Wang, Qingfu Zhu, Zhiming Zhang, Xuanyu Zhang, Qing Yang, Dongliang Xu, Wanxiang Che","The rapid growth in the parameters of large language models (LLMs) has made inference latency a fundamental bottleneck, limiting broader application of LLMs. Speculative decoding represents a lossless approach to accelerate inference through a guess-and-verify paradigm, leveraging the parallel capabilities of modern hardware. Some speculative decoding methods rely on additional structures to guess draft tokens, such as small models or parameter-efficient architectures, which need extra training before use. Alternatively, retrieval-based train-free techniques build libraries from pre-existing corpora or by n-gram generation. However, they face challenges like large storage requirements, time-consuming retrieval, and limited adaptability. Observing that candidate tokens generated during the decoding process are likely to reoccur in future sequences, we propose Token Recycling. This approach stores candidate tokens in an adjacency matrix and employs a breadth-first search (BFS)-like algorithm on the matrix to construct a draft tree. The tree is then validated through tree attention. New candidate tokens from the decoding process are then used to update the matrix. Token Recycling requires \textless2MB of additional storage and achieves approximately 2x speedup across all sizes of LLMs. It significantly outperforms existing train-free methods by 30\% and even a training method by 25\%. It can be directly applied to any existing LLMs and tasks without the need for adaptation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08696v1,2024-08
Quantifying the Effectiveness of Student Organization Activities using Natural Language Processing,"Lyberius Ennio F. Taruc, Arvin R. De La Cruz","Student extracurricular activities play an important role in enriching the students' educational experiences. With the increasing popularity of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, it becomes a logical step that incorporating ML-NLP in improving extracurricular activities is a potential focus of study in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This research study aims to develop a machine learning workflow that will quantify the effectiveness of student-organized activities based on student emotional responses using sentiment analysis. The study uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Large Language Model (LLM) called via the pysentimiento toolkit, as a Transformer pipeline in Hugging Face. A sample data set from Organization C, a Recognized Student Organization (RSO) of a higher educational institute in the Philippines, College X, was used to develop the workflow. The workflow consisted of data preprocessing, key feature selection, LLM feature processing, and score aggregation, resulting in an Event Score for each data set. The results show that the BERT LLM can also be used effectively in analyzing sentiment beyond product reviews and post comments. For the student affairs offices of educational institutions, this study can provide a practical example of how NLP can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing the potential impact of data-driven decision making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08694v1,2024-08
Med-PMC: Medical Personalized Multi-modal Consultation with a Proactive Ask-First-Observe-Next Paradigm,"Hongcheng Liu, Yusheng Liao, Siqv Ou, Yuhao Wang, Heyang Liu, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang","The application of the Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in medical clinical scenarios remains underexplored. Previous benchmarks only focus on the capacity of the MLLMs in medical visual question-answering (VQA) or report generation and fail to assess the performance of the MLLMs on complex clinical multi-modal tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Medical Personalized Multi-modal Consultation (Med-PMC) paradigm to evaluate the clinical capacity of the MLLMs. Med-PMC builds a simulated clinical environment where the MLLMs are required to interact with a patient simulator to complete the multi-modal information-gathering and decision-making task. Specifically, the patient simulator is decorated with personalized actors to simulate diverse patients in real scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments to access 12 types of MLLMs, providing a comprehensive view of the MLLMs' clinical performance. We found that current MLLMs fail to gather multimodal information and show potential bias in the decision-making task when consulted with the personalized patient simulators. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of Med-PMC, showing the potential to guide the development of robust and reliable clinical MLLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/LiuHC0428/Med-PMC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08693v1,2024-08
The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic Preference Optimization Dataset Generation,"Samee Arif, Sualeha Farid, Abdul Hameed Azeemi, Awais Athar, Agha Ali Raza","This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-agent workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) response evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the response generation module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08688v4,2024-08
LLM-PCGC: Large Language Model-based Point Cloud Geometry Compression,"Yuqi Ye, Wei Gao","The key to effective point cloud compression is to obtain a robust context model consistent with complex 3D data structures. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted their capabilities not only as powerful generators for in-context learning and generation but also as effective compressors. These dual attributes of LLMs make them particularly well-suited to meet the demands of data compression. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of using LLM for compression tasks, focusing on lossless point cloud geometry compression (PCGC) experiments. However, applying LLM directly to PCGC tasks presents some significant challenges, i.e., LLM does not understand the structure of the point cloud well, and it is a difficult task to fill the gap between text and point cloud through text description, especially for large complicated and small shapeless point clouds. To address these problems, we introduce a novel architecture, namely the Large Language Model-based Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LLM-PCGC) method, using LLM to compress point cloud geometry information without any text description or aligning operation. By utilizing different adaptation techniques for cross-modality representation alignment and semantic consistency, including clustering, K-tree, token mapping invariance, and Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the proposed method can translate LLM to a compressor/generator for point cloud. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structure to employ LLM as a compressor for point cloud data. Experiments demonstrate that the LLM-PCGC outperforms the other existing methods significantly, by achieving -40.213% bit rate reduction compared to the reference software of MPEG Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) standard, and by achieving -2.267% bit rate reduction compared to the state-of-the-art learning-based method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08682v1,2024-08
MIA-Tuner: Adapting Large Language Models as Pre-training Text Detector,"Wenjie Fu, Huandong Wang, Chen Gao, Guanghua Liu, Yong Li, Tao Jiang","The increasing parameters and expansive dataset of large language models (LLMs) highlight the urgent demand for a technical solution to audit the underlying privacy risks and copyright issues associated with LLMs. Existing studies have partially addressed this need through an exploration of the pre-training data detection problem, which is an instance of a membership inference attack (MIA). This problem involves determining whether a given piece of text has been used during the pre-training phase of the target LLM. Although existing methods have designed various sophisticated MIA score functions to achieve considerable detection performance in pre-trained LLMs, how to achieve high-confidence detection and how to perform MIA on aligned LLMs remain challenging. In this paper, we propose MIA-Tuner, a novel instruction-based MIA method, which instructs LLMs themselves to serve as a more precise pre-training data detector internally, rather than design an external MIA score function. Furthermore, we design two instruction-based safeguards to respectively mitigate the privacy risks brought by the existing methods and MIA-Tuner. To comprehensively evaluate the most recent state-of-the-art LLMs, we collect a more up-to-date MIA benchmark dataset, named WIKIMIA-24, to replace the widely adopted benchmark WIKIMIA. We conduct extensive experiments across various aligned and unaligned LLMs over the two benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that MIA-Tuner increases the AUC of MIAs from 0.7 to a significantly high level of 0.9.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08661v1,2024-08
LLMs Are Biased Towards Output Formats! Systematically Evaluating and Mitigating Output Format Bias of LLMs,"Do Xuan Long, Hai Nguyen Ngoc, Tiviatis Sim, Hieu Dao, Shafiq Joty, Kenji Kawaguchi, Nancy F. Chen, Min-Yen Kan","We present the first systematic evaluation examining format bias in performance of large language models (LLMs). Our approach distinguishes between two categories of an evaluation metric under format constraints to reliably and accurately assess performance: one measures performance when format constraints are adhered to, while the other evaluates performance regardless of constraint adherence. We then define a metric for measuring the format bias of LLMs and establish effective strategies to reduce it. Subsequently, we present our empirical format bias evaluation spanning four commonly used categories -- multiple-choice question-answer, wrapping, list, and mapping -- covering 15 widely-used formats. Our evaluation on eight generation tasks uncovers significant format bias across state-of-the-art LLMs. We further discover that improving the format-instruction following capabilities of LLMs across formats potentially reduces format bias. Based on our evaluation findings, we study prompting and fine-tuning with synthesized format data techniques to mitigate format bias. Our methods successfully reduce the variance in ChatGPT's performance among wrapping formats from 235.33 to 0.71 (%$^2$).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08656v1,2024-08
Reasoning Beyond Bias: A Study on Counterfactual Prompting and Chain of Thought Reasoning,"Kyle Moore, Jesse Roberts, Thao Pham, Douglas Fisher","Language models are known to absorb biases from their training data, leading to predictions driven by statistical regularities rather than semantic relevance. We investigate the impact of these biases on answer choice preferences in the Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding (MMLU) task. Our findings reveal that differences in learned regularities across answer options are predictive of model preferences and mirror human test-taking strategies. To address this issue, we introduce two novel methods: Counterfactual Prompting with Chain of Thought (CoT) and Counterfactual Prompting with Agnostically Primed CoT (APriCoT). We demonstrate that while Counterfactual Prompting with CoT alone is insufficient to mitigate bias, our novel Primed Counterfactual Prompting with CoT approach effectively reduces the influence of base-rate probabilities while improving overall accuracy. Our results suggest that mitigating bias requires a ""System-2"" like process and that CoT reasoning is susceptible to confirmation bias under some prompting methodologies. Our contributions offer practical solutions for developing more robust and fair language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08651v2,2024-08
An End-to-End Model for Photo-Sharing Multi-modal Dialogue Generation,"Peiming Guo, Sinuo Liu, Yanzhao Zhang, Dingkun Long, Pengjun Xie, Meishan Zhang, Min Zhang","Photo-Sharing Multi-modal dialogue generation requires a dialogue agent not only to generate text responses but also to share photos at the proper moment. Using image text caption as the bridge, a pipeline model integrates an image caption model, a text generation model, and an image generation model to handle this complex multi-modal task. However, representing the images with text captions may loss important visual details and information and cause error propagation in the complex dialogue system. Besides, the pipeline model isolates the three models separately because discrete image text captions hinder end-to-end gradient propagation. We propose the first end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation, which integrates an image perceptron and an image generator with a large language model. The large language model employs the Q-Former to perceive visual images in the input end. For image generation in the output end, we propose a dynamic vocabulary transformation matrix and use straight-through and gumbel-softmax techniques to align the large language model and stable diffusion model and achieve end-to-end gradient propagation. We perform experiments on PhotoChat and DialogCC datasets to evaluate our end-to-end model. Compared with pipeline models, the end-to-end model gains state-of-the-art performances on various metrics of text and image generation. More analysis experiments also verify the effectiveness of the end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08650v1,2024-08
Understanding Enthymemes in Argument Maps: Bridging Argument Mining and Logic-based Argumentation,"Jonathan Ben-Naim, Victor David, Anthony Hunter","Argument mining is natural language processing technology aimed at identifying arguments in text. Furthermore, the approach is being developed to identify the premises and claims of those arguments, and to identify the relationships between arguments including support and attack relationships. In this paper, we assume that an argument map contains the premises and claims of arguments, and support and attack relationships between them, that have been identified by argument mining. So from a piece of text, we assume an argument map is obtained automatically by natural language processing. However, to understand and to automatically analyse that argument map, it would be desirable to instantiate that argument map with logical arguments. Once we have the logical representation of the arguments in an argument map, we can use automated reasoning to analyze the argumentation (e.g. check consistency of premises, check validity of claims, and check the labelling on each arc corresponds with thw logical arguments). We address this need by using classical logic for representing the explicit information in the text, and using default logic for representing the implicit information in the text. In order to investigate our proposal, we consider some specific options for instantiation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08648v1,2024-08
Math-PUMA: Progressive Upward Multimodal Alignment to Enhance Mathematical Reasoning,"Wenwen Zhuang, Xin Huang, Xiantao Zhang, Jin Zeng","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in solving text-based mathematical problems, but they struggle with mathematical diagrams since they are primarily trained on natural scene images. For humans, visual aids generally enhance problem-solving, but MLLMs perform worse as information shifts from textual to visual modality. This decline is mainly due to their shortcomings in aligning images and text. To tackle aforementioned challenges, we propose Math-PUMA, a methodology focused on Progressive Upward Multimodal Alignment. This approach is designed to improve the mathematical reasoning skills of MLLMs through a three-stage training process, with the second stage being the critical alignment stage. We first enhance the language model's mathematical reasoning capabilities with extensive set of textual mathematical problems. We then construct a multimodal dataset with varying degrees of textual and visual information, creating data pairs by presenting each problem in at least two forms. By leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of next-token prediction distributions to align visual and textual modalities, consistent problem-solving abilities are ensured. Finally, we utilize multimodal instruction tuning for MLLMs with high-quality multimodal data. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the MLLMs trained with Math-PUMA surpass most open-source MLLMs. Our approach effectively narrows the performance gap for problems presented in different modalities. The code and data are available at: \url{https://github.com/wwzhuang01/Math-PUMA}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08640v2,2024-08
A Survey on Benchmarks of Multimodal Large Language Models,"Jian Li, Weiheng Lu, Hao Fei, Meng Luo, Ming Dai, Min Xia, Yizhang Jin, Zhenye Gan, Ding Qi, Chaoyou Fu, Ying Tai, Wankou Yang, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry due to their remarkable performance in various applications such as visual question answering, visual perception, understanding, and reasoning.

Persona is a Double-edged Sword: Mitigating the Negative Impact of Role-playing Prompts in Zero-shot Reasoning Tasks,"Junseok Kim, Nakyeong Yang, Kyomin Jung","Recent studies demonstrate that prompting a role-playing persona to an LLM improves reasoning capability. However, assigning an adequate persona is difficult since LLMs are extremely sensitive to assigned prompts; thus, inaccurately defined personas sometimes hinder LLMs and degrade their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we first investigate the potential negative impact of injecting persona into language models. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework, Jekyll \& Hyde, which ensembles the outcomes of both role-playing and neutral prompts to enhance the robustness of reasoning ability. Specifically, Jekyll \& Hyde predicts an appropriate persona using an LLM when defining the role-playing prompt. Then, Jekyll \& Hyde collects two potential solutions from role-playing and neutral prompts and selects a better solution using the LLM evaluator. The experimental analysis demonstrates that role-playing prompts sometimes distract LLMs, degrading their reasoning abilities in 7 out of 12 datasets in llama3. Meanwhile, Jekyll \& Hyde improve reasoning capabilities by selecting better choices among the potential solutions on twelve widely-used natural language reasoning datasets. In addition, we reveal that assigning LLM-generated personas obtains more stable results than handcrafted personas.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08631v2,2024-08
RealMedQA: A pilot biomedical question answering dataset containing realistic clinical questions,"Gregory Kell, Angus Roberts, Serge Umansky, Yuti Khare, Najma Ahmed, Nikhil Patel, Chloe Simela, Jack Coumbe, Julian Rozario, Ryan-Rhys Griffiths, Iain J. Marshall","Clinical question answering systems have the potential to provide clinicians with relevant and timely answers to their questions. Nonetheless, despite the advances that have been made, adoption of these systems in clinical settings has been slow. One issue is a lack of question-answering datasets which reflect the real-world needs of health professionals. In this work, we present RealMedQA, a dataset of realistic clinical questions generated by humans and an LLM. We describe the process for generating and verifying the QA pairs and assess several QA models on BioASQ and RealMedQA to assess the relative difficulty of matching answers to questions. We show that the LLM is more cost-efficient for generating ""ideal"" QA pairs. Additionally, we achieve a lower lexical similarity between questions and answers than BioASQ which provides an additional challenge to the top two QA models, as per the results. We release our code and our dataset publicly to encourage further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08624v1,2024-08
Convexity-based Pruning of Speech Representation Models,"Teresa Dorszewski, Lenka Tětková, Lars Kai Hansen","Speech representation models based on the transformer architecture and trained by self-supervised learning have shown great promise for solving tasks such as speech and speaker recognition, keyword spotting, emotion detection, and more. Typically, it is found that larger models lead to better performance. However, the significant computational effort involved in such large transformer systems is a challenge for embedded and real-world applications. Recent work has shown that there is significant redundancy in the transformer models for NLP and massive layer pruning is feasible (Sajjad et al., 2023). Here, we investigate layer pruning in audio models. We base the pruning decision on a convexity criterion. Convexity of classification regions has recently been proposed as an indicator of subsequent fine-tuning performance in a range of application domains, including NLP and audio. In empirical investigations, we find a massive reduction in the computational effort with no loss of performance or even improvements in certain cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11858v1,2024-08
A Mechanistic Interpretation of Syllogistic Reasoning in Auto-Regressive Language Models,"Geonhee Kim, Marco Valentino, André Freitas","Recent studies on logical reasoning in auto-regressive Language Models (LMs) have sparked a debate on whether such models can learn systematic reasoning principles during pre-training or merely exploit superficial patterns in the training data. This paper presents a mechanistic interpretation of syllogistic reasoning in LMs to further enhance our understanding of internal dynamics. Specifically, we present a methodology for circuit discovery aimed at disentangling content-independent reasoning mechanisms from world knowledge acquired during pre-training. Through two distinct intervention methods, we uncover a sufficient and necessary circuit involving middle-term suppression that elucidates how LMs transfer information to derive valid conclusions from premises. Furthermore, we investigate how belief biases manifest in syllogistic reasoning, finding evidence of partial contamination from additional attention heads responsible for encoding commonsense and contextualized knowledge. Finally, we explore the generalization of the discovered mechanisms across various syllogistic schemes and model sizes, finding that the identified circuit is sufficient and necessary for all the schemes on which the model achieves high downstream accuracy ($\geq$ 60\%). Overall, our findings suggest that LMs indeed learn transferable content-independent reasoning mechanisms, but that, at the same time, such mechanisms do not involve generalisable and abstract logical primitives, being susceptible to contamination by the same world knowledge acquired during pre-training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08590v1,2024-08
"Using large language models to estimate features of multi-word expressions: Concreteness, valence, arousal","Gonzalo Martínez, Juan Diego Molero, Sandra González, Javier Conde, Marc Brysbaert, Pedro Reviriego","This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate estimates of concreteness, valence and arousal for multi-word expressions. Unlike previous artificial intelligence (AI) methods, LLMs can capture the nuanced meanings of multi-word expressions. We systematically evaluated ChatGPT-4o's ability to predict concreteness, valence and arousal. In Study 1, ChatGPT-4o showed strong correlations with human concreteness ratings (r = .8) for multi-word expressions. In Study 2, these findings were repeated for valence and arousal ratings of individual words, matching or outperforming previous AI models. Study 3 extended the prevalence and arousal analysis to multi-word expressions and showed promising results despite the lack of large-scale human benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for generating valuable psycholinguistic data related to multiword expressions. To help researchers with stimulus selection, we provide datasets with AI norms of concreteness, valence and arousal for 126,397 English single words and 63,680 multi-word expressions",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16012v1,2024-08

Collaborative Cross-modal Fusion with Large Language Model for Recommendation,"Zhongzhou Liu, Hao Zhang, Kuicai Dong, Yuan Fang","Despite the success of conventional collaborative filtering (CF) approaches for recommendation systems, they exhibit limitations in leveraging semantic knowledge within the textual attributes of users and items. Recent focus on the application of large language models for recommendation (LLM4Rec) has highlighted their capability for effective semantic knowledge capture. However, these methods often overlook the collaborative signals in user behaviors. Some simply instruct-tune a language model, while others directly inject the embeddings of a CF-based model, lacking a synergistic fusion of different modalities. To address these issues, we propose a framework of Collaborative Cross-modal Fusion with Large Language Models, termed CCF-LLM, for recommendation. In this framework, we translate the user-item interactions into a hybrid prompt to encode both semantic knowledge and collaborative signals, and then employ an attentive cross-modal fusion strategy to effectively fuse latent embeddings of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCF-LLM outperforms existing methods by effectively utilizing semantic and collaborative signals in the LLM4Rec context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08564v1,2024-08
Integrating Multi-view Analysis: Multi-view Mixture-of-Expert for Textual Personality Detection,"Haohao Zhu, Xiaokun Zhang, Junyu Lu, Liang Yang, Hongfei Lin","Textual personality detection aims to identify personality traits by analyzing user-generated content. To achieve this effectively, it is essential to thoroughly examine user-generated content from various perspectives. However, previous studies have struggled with automatically extracting and effectively integrating information from multiple perspectives, thereby limiting their performance on personality detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-view Mixture-of-Experts Model for Textual Personality Detection (MvP). MvP introduces a Multi-view Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network to automatically analyze user posts from various perspectives. Additionally, it employs User Consistency Regularization to mitigate conflicts among different perspectives and learn a multi-view generic user representation. The model's training is optimized via a multi-task joint learning strategy that balances supervised personality detection with self-supervised user consistency constraints. Experimental results on two widely-used personality detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the MvP model and the benefits of automatically analyzing user posts from diverse perspectives for textual personality detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08551v1,2024-08
SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language Models,"Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar","Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse LLMs. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baselines. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an oracle with LLMs and explore in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between Oracle and SelectLLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08545v2,2024-08
Where is the signal in tokenization space?,"Renato Lui Geh, Honghua Zhang, Kareem Ahmed, Benjie Wang, Guy Van den Broeck","Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically shipped with tokenizers that deterministically encode text into so-called canonical token sequences, to which the LLMs assign probability values. One common assumption is that the probability of a piece of text is the probability of its canonical token sequence. However, the tokenization of a string is not unique: e.g., the Llama2 tokenizer encodes Tokens as [Tok,ens], but [Tok,en,s] also represents the same text. In this paper, we study non-canonical tokenizations. We prove that, given a string, it is computationally hard to find the most likely tokenization for an autoregressive LLM, as well as to compute the marginal probability over all possible tokenizations. We then show how the marginal is, in most cases, indistinguishable from the canonical probability. Surprisingly, we then empirically demonstrate the existence of a significant amount of signal hidden within tokenization space. Notably, by simply aggregating the probabilities of non-canonical tokenizations, we achieve improvements across a range of LLM evaluation benchmarks for a variety of architectures, including transformers and state space models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08541v1,2024-08

MuRAR: A Simple and Effective Multimodal Retrieval and Answer Refinement Framework for Multimodal Question Answering,"Zhengyuan Zhu, Daniel Lee, Hong Zhang, Sai Sree Harsha, Loic Feujio, Akash Maharaj, Yunyao Li","Recent advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have demonstrated impressive performance in the question-answering (QA) task. However, most previous works predominantly focus on text-based answers. While some studies address multimodal data, they still fall short in generating comprehensive multimodal answers, particularly for explaining concepts or providing step-by-step tutorials on how to accomplish specific goals. This capability is especially valuable for applications such as enterprise chatbots and settings such as customer service and educational systems, where the answers are sourced from multimodal data. In this paper, we introduce a simple and effective framework named MuRAR (Multimodal Retrieval and Answer Refinement). MuRAR enhances text-based answers by retrieving relevant multimodal data and refining the responses to create coherent multimodal answers. This framework can be easily extended to support multimodal answers in enterprise chatbots with minimal modifications. Human evaluation results indicate that multimodal answers generated by MuRAR are more useful and readable compared to plain text answers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08521v1,2024-08
"Ex3: Automatic Novel Writing by Extracting, Excelsior and Expanding","Lei Huang, Jiaming Guo, Guanhua He, Xishan Zhang, Rui Zhang, Shaohui Peng, Shaoli Liu, Tianshi Chen","Generating long-term texts such as novels using artificial intelligence has always been a challenge. A common approach is to use large language models (LLMs) to construct a hierarchical framework that first plans and then writes. Despite the fact that the generated novels reach a sufficient length, they exhibit poor logical coherence and appeal in their plots and deficiencies in character and event depiction, ultimately compromising the overall narrative quality. In this paper, we propose a method named Extracting Excelsior and Expanding. Ex3 initially extracts structure information from raw novel data. By combining this structure information with the novel data, an instruction-following dataset is meticulously crafted. This dataset is then utilized to fine-tune the LLM, aiming for excelsior generation performance. In the final stage, a tree-like expansion method is deployed to facilitate the generation of arbitrarily long novels. Evaluation against previous methods showcases Ex3's ability to produce higher-quality long-form novels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08506v2,2024-08
DePrompt: Desensitization and Evaluation of Personal Identifiable Information in Large Language Model Prompts,"Xiongtao Sun, Gan Liu, Zhipeng He, Hui Li, Xiaoguang Li","Prompt serves as a crucial link in interacting with large language models (LLMs), widely impacting the accuracy and interpretability of model outputs. However, acquiring accurate and high-quality responses necessitates precise prompts, which inevitably pose significant risks of personal identifiable information (PII) leakage. Therefore, this paper proposes DePrompt, a desensitization protection and effectiveness evaluation framework for prompt, enabling users to safely and transparently utilize LLMs. Specifically, by leveraging large model fine-tuning techniques as the underlying privacy protection method, we integrate contextual attributes to define privacy types, achieving high-precision PII entity identification. Additionally, through the analysis of key features in prompt desensitization scenarios, we devise adversarial generative desensitization methods that retain important semantic content while disrupting the link between identifiers and privacy attributes. Furthermore, we present utility evaluation metrics for prompt to better gauge and balance privacy and usability. Our framework is adaptable to prompts and can be extended to text usability-dependent scenarios. Through comparison with benchmarks and other model methods, experimental evaluations demonstrate that our desensitized prompt exhibit superior privacy protection utility and model inference results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08930v1,2024-08
JPEG-LM: LLMs as Image Generators with Canonical Codec Representations,"Xiaochuang Han, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Pang Wei Koh, Yulia Tsvetkov","Recent work in image and video generation has been adopting the autoregressive LLM architecture due to its generality and potentially easy integration into multi-modal systems. The crux of applying autoregressive training in language generation to visual generation is discretization -- representing continuous data like images and videos as discrete tokens. Common methods of discretizing images and videos include modeling raw pixel values, which are prohibitively lengthy, or vector quantization, which requires convoluted pre-hoc training. In this work, we propose to directly model images and videos as compressed files saved on computers via canonical codecs (e.g., JPEG, AVC/H.264). Using the default Llama architecture without any vision-specific modifications, we pretrain JPEG-LM from scratch to generate images (and AVC-LM to generate videos as a proof of concept), by directly outputting compressed file bytes in JPEG and AVC formats. Evaluation of image generation shows that this simple and straightforward approach is more effective than pixel-based modeling and sophisticated vector quantization baselines (on which our method yields a 31% reduction in FID). Our analysis shows that JPEG-LM has an especial advantage over vector quantization models in generating long-tail visual elements. Overall, we show that using canonical codec representations can help lower the barriers between language generation and visual generation, facilitating future research on multi-modal language/image/video LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08459v2,2024-08
W-RAG: Weakly Supervised Dense Retrieval in RAG for Open-domain Question Answering,"Jinming Nian, Zhiyuan Peng, Qifan Wang, Yi Fang","In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA), Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers relying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG by utilizing the ranking capabilities of LLMs to create weakly labeled data for training dense retrievers. Specifically, we rerank the top-$K$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that LLMs will generate the correct answer based on the question and each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive training examples for dense retrieval. Our comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08444v1,2024-08

Homan","Human feedback is essential for building human-centered AI systems across domains where disagreement is prevalent, such as AI safety, content moderation, or sentiment analysis. Many disagreements, particularly in politically charged settings, arise because raters have opposing values or beliefs. Vicarious annotation is a method for breaking down disagreement by asking raters how they think others would annotate the data. In this paper, we explore the use of vicarious annotation with analytical methods for moderating rater disagreement. We employ rater cohesion metrics to study the potential influence of political affiliations and demographic backgrounds on raters' perceptions of offense.

VerilogCoder: Autonomous Verilog Coding Agents with Graph-based Planning and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based Waveform Tracing Tool,"Chia-Tung Ho, Haoxing Ren, Brucek Khailany","Due to the growing complexity of modern Integrated Circuits (ICs), automating hardware design can prevent a significant amount of human error from the engineering process and result in less errors. Verilog is a popular hardware description language for designing and modeling digital systems; thus, Verilog generation is one of the emerging areas of research to facilitate the design process. In this work, we propose VerilogCoder, a system of multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Verilog code generation, to autonomously write Verilog code and fix syntax and functional errors using collaborative Verilog tools (i.e., syntax checker, simulator, and waveform tracer). Firstly, we propose a task planner that utilizes a novel Task and Circuit Relation Graph retrieval method to construct a holistic plan based on module descriptions. To debug and fix functional errors, we develop a novel and efficient abstract syntax tree (AST)-based waveform tracing tool, which is integrated within the autonomous Verilog completion flow.

Level Up Your Tutorials: VLMs for Game Tutorials Quality Assessment,"Daniele Rege Cambrin, Gabriele Scaffidi Militone, Luca Colomba, Giovanni Malnati, Daniele Apiletti, Paolo Garza","Designing effective game tutorials is crucial for a smooth learning curve for new players, especially in games with many rules and complex core mechanics. Evaluating the effectiveness of these tutorials usually requires multiple iterations with testers who have no prior knowledge of the game. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and interpreting visual content. VLMs can analyze images, provide detailed insights, and answer questions about their content. They can recognize objects, actions, and contexts in visual data, making them valuable tools for various applications, including automated game testing. In this work, we propose an automated game-testing solution to evaluate the quality of game tutorials. Our approach leverages VLMs to analyze frames from video game tutorials, answer relevant questions to simulate human perception, and provide feedback. This feedback is compared with expected results to identify confusing or problematic scenes and highlight potential errors for developers.

Dynamic Adaptive Optimization for Effective Sentiment Analysis Fine-Tuning on Large Language Models,"Hongcheng Ding, Xuanze Zhao, Shamsul Nahar Abdullah, Deshinta Arrova Dewi, Zixiao Jiang, Xiangyu Shi","Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in various domains, such as business intelligence and financial forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) have become a popular paradigm for sentiment analysis, leveraging multi-task learning to address specific tasks concurrently. However, LLMs with fine-tuning for sentiment analysis often underperforms due to the inherent challenges in managing diverse task complexities. Moreover, constant-weight approaches in multi-task learning struggle to adapt to variations in data characteristics, further complicating model effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework with a dynamic adaptive optimization (DAO) module. This module is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing an effective and flexible solution for multi-task learning. The key component of the DAO module is dynamic adaptive loss, which dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to different tasks based on their relative importance and data characteristics during training. Sentiment analyses on a standard and customized financial text dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance. Specifically, this work improves the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Accuracy (ACC) by 15.58% and 1.24% respectively, compared with previous work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11856v2,2024-08
Towards Realistic Synthetic User-Generated Content: A Scaffolding Approach to Generating Online Discussions,"Krisztian Balog, John Palowitch, Barbara Ikica, Filip Radlinski, Hamidreza Alvari, Mehdi Manshadi","The emergence of synthetic data represents a pivotal shift in modern machine learning, offering a solution to satisfy the need for large volumes of data in domains where real data is scarce, highly private, or difficult to obtain. We investigate the feasibility of creating realistic, large-scale synthetic datasets of user-generated content, noting that such content is increasingly prevalent and a source of frequently sought information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a starting point for generating synthetic social media discussion threads, due to their ability to produce diverse responses that typify online interactions. However, as we demonstrate, straightforward application of LLMs yields limited success in capturing the complex structure of online discussions, and standard prompting mechanisms lack sufficient control. We therefore propose a multi-step generation process, predicated on the idea of creating compact representations of discussion threads, referred to as scaffolds. Our framework is generic yet adaptable to the unique characteristics of specific social media platforms. We demonstrate its feasibility using data from two distinct online discussion platforms. To address the fundamental challenge of ensuring the representativeness and realism of synthetic data, we propose a portfolio of evaluation measures to compare various instantiations of our framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08379v1,2024-08
Evaluating Text Classification Robustness to Part-of-Speech Adversarial Examples,"Anahita Samadi, Allison Sullivan","As machine learning systems become more widely used, especially for safety critical applications, there is a growing need to ensure that these systems behave as intended, even in the face of adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are inputs that are designed to trick the decision making process, and are intended to be imperceptible to humans. However, for text-based classification systems, changes to the input, a string of text, are always perceptible. Therefore, text-based adversarial examples instead focus on trying to preserve semantics. Unfortunately, recent work has shown this goal is often not met. To improve the quality of text-based adversarial examples, we need to know what elements of the input text are worth focusing on. To address this, in this paper, we explore what parts of speech have the highest impact of text-based classifiers. Our experiments highlight a distinct bias in CNN algorithms against certain parts of speech tokens within review datasets. This finding underscores a critical vulnerability in the linguistic processing capabilities of CNNs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08374v1,2024-08
Can Large Language Models Understand Symbolic Graphics Programs?,"Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu, Haiwen Feng, Zhen Liu, Tim Z. Xiao, Katherine M. Collins, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Adrian Weller, Michael J. Black, Bernhard Schölkopf","Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is an urgent need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer different-grained semantic-level questions of the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to ""imagine"" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08313v3,2024-08
ScalingFilter: Assessing Data Quality through Inverse Utilization of Scaling Laws,"Ruihang Li, Yixuan Wei, Miaosen Zhang, Nenghai Yu, Han Hu, Houwen Peng","High-quality data is crucial for the pre-training performance of large language models. Unfortunately, existing quality filtering methods rely on a known high-quality dataset as reference, which can introduce potential bias and compromise diversity. In this paper, we propose ScalingFilter, a novel approach that evaluates text quality based on the perplexity difference between two language models trained on the same data, thereby eliminating the influence of the reference dataset in the filtering process. An theoretical analysis shows that ScalingFilter is equivalent to an inverse utilization of scaling laws. Through training models with 1.3B parameters on the same data source processed by various quality filters, we find ScalingFilter can improve zero-shot performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. To assess the bias introduced by quality filtering, we introduce semantic diversity, a metric of utilizing text embedding models for semantic representations. Extensive experiments reveal that semantic diversity is a reliable indicator of dataset diversity, and ScalingFilter achieves an optimal balance between downstream performance and semantic diversity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08310v1,2024-08
"Benchmarking the Capabilities of Large Language Models in Transportation System Engineering: Accuracy, Consistency, and Reasoning Behaviors","Usman Syed, Ethan Light, Xingang Guo, Huan Zhang, Lianhui Qin, Yanfeng Ouyang, Bin Hu","In this paper, we explore the capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3, and Llama 3.1 in solving some selected undergraduate-level transportation engineering problems. We introduce TransportBench, a benchmark dataset that includes a sample of transportation engineering problems on a wide range of subjects in the context of planning, design, management, and control of transportation systems. This dataset is used by human experts to evaluate the capabilities of various commercial and open-sourced LLMs, especially their accuracy, consistency, and reasoning behaviors, in solving transportation engineering problems. Our comprehensive analysis uncovers the unique strengths and limitations of each LLM, e.g. our analysis shows the impressive accuracy and some unexpected inconsistent behaviors of Claude 3.5 Sonnet in solving TransportBench problems.

The ShareLM Collection and Plugin: Contributing Human-Model Chats for the Benefit of the Community,"Shachar Don-Yehiya, Leshem Choshen, Omri Abend","Human-model conversations provide a window into users' real-world scenarios, behavior, and needs, and thus are a valuable resource for model development and research. While for-profit companies collect user data through the APIs of their models, using it internally to improve their own models, the open source and research community lags behind.   We introduce the ShareLM collection, a unified set of human conversations with large language models, and its accompanying plugin, a Web extension for voluntarily contributing user-model conversations. Where few platforms share their chats, the ShareLM plugin adds this functionality, thus, allowing users to share conversations from most platforms. The plugin allows the user to rate their conversations, both at the conversation and the response levels, and delete conversations they prefer to keep private before they ever leave the user's local storage. We release the plugin conversations as part of the ShareLM collection, and call for more community effort in the field of open human-model data.   The code, plugin, and data are available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08291v1,2024-08

Ho, Percy Liang","Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks for each task, which break down a task into intermediary steps for a more detailed evaluation. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 8 models: GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. For the top performing models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet), we further investigate performance across 4 agent scaffolds (structed bash, action-only, pseudoterminal, and web search). Without subtask guidance, agents leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, and Claude 3 Opus successfully solved complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve. In comparison, the most difficult task took human teams 24 hours and 54 minutes to solve.

FactorLLM: Factorizing Knowledge via Mixture of Experts for Large Language Models,"Zhongyu Zhao, Menghang Dong, Rongyu Zhang, Wenzhao Zheng, Yunpeng Zhang, Huanrui Yang, Dalong Du, Kurt Keutzer, Shanghang Zhang","Recent research has demonstrated that Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in Large Language Models (LLMs) play a pivotal role in storing diverse linguistic and factual knowledge. Conventional methods frequently face challenges due to knowledge confusion stemming from their monolithic and redundant architectures, which calls for more efficient solutions with minimal computational overhead, particularly for LLMs. In this paper, we explore the FFN computation paradigm in LLMs and introduce FactorLLM, a novel approach that decomposes well-trained dense FFNs into sparse sub-networks without requiring any further modifications, while maintaining the same level of performance. Furthermore, we embed a router from the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), combined with our devised Prior-Approximate (PA) loss term that facilitates the dynamic activation of experts and knowledge adaptation, thereby accelerating computational processes and enhancing performance using minimal training data and fine-tuning steps. FactorLLM thus enables efficient knowledge factorization and activates select groups of experts specifically tailored to designated tasks, emulating the interactive functional segmentation of the human brain. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FactorLLM which achieves comparable performance to the source model securing up to 85% model performance while obtaining over a 30% increase in inference speed.

Inductive Learning of Logical Theories with LLMs: A Complexity-graded Analysis,"João Pedro Gandarela, Danilo S. Carvalho, André Freitas","This work presents a novel systematic methodology to analyse the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) with feedback from a formal inference engine, on logic theory induction. The analysis is complexity-graded w.r.t. rule dependency structure, allowing quantification of specific inference challenges on LLM performance. Integrating LLMs with formal methods is a promising frontier in the Natural Language Processing field, as an important avenue for improving model inference control and explainability. In particular, inductive learning over complex sets of facts and rules, poses unique challenges for current autoregressive models, as they lack explicit symbolic grounding. While they can be complemented by formal systems, the properties delivered by LLMs regarding inductive learning, are not well understood and quantified. Empirical results indicate that the largest LLMs can achieve competitive results against a SOTA Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system baseline, but also that tracking long predicate relationship chains is a more difficult obstacle than theory complexity for the LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16779v1,2024-08
Evolving Text Data Stream Mining,Jay Kumar,"A text stream is an ordered sequence of text documents generated over time. A massive amount of such text data is generated by online social platforms every day. Designing an algorithm for such text streams to extract useful information is a challenging task due to unique properties of the stream such as infinite length, data sparsity, and evolution. Thereby, learning useful information from such streaming data under the constraint of limited time and memory has gained increasing attention. During the past decade, although many text stream mining algorithms have proposed, there still exists some potential issues. First, high-dimensional text data heavily degrades the learning performance until the model either works on subspace or reduces the global feature space. The second issue is to extract semantic text representation of documents and capture evolving topics over time. Moreover, the problem of label scarcity exists, whereas existing approaches work on the full availability of labeled data. To deal with these issues, in this thesis, new learning models are proposed for clustering and multi-label learning on text streams.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00010v1,2024-08
Covert Bias: The Severity of Social Views' Unalignment in Language Models Towards Implicit and Explicit Opinion,"Abeer Aldayel, Areej Alokaili, Rehab Alahmadi","While various approaches have recently been studied for bias identification, little is known about how implicit language that does not explicitly convey a viewpoint affects bias amplification in large language models. To examine the severity of bias toward a view, we evaluated the performance of two downstream tasks where the implicit and explicit knowledge of social groups were used. First, we present a stress test evaluation by using a biased model in edge cases of excessive bias scenarios. Then, we evaluate how LLMs calibrate linguistically in response to both implicit and explicit opinions when they are aligned with conflicting viewpoints. Our findings reveal a discrepancy in LLM performance in identifying implicit and explicit opinions, with a general tendency of bias toward explicit opinions of opposing stances. Moreover, the bias-aligned models generate more cautious responses using uncertainty phrases compared to the unaligned (zero-shot) base models. The direct, incautious responses of the unaligned models suggest a need for further refinement of decisiveness by incorporating uncertainty markers to enhance their reliability, especially on socially nuanced topics with high subjectivity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08212v2,2024-08
Prefix Guidance: A Steering Wheel for Large Language Models to Defend Against Jailbreak Attacks,"Jiawei Zhao, Kejiang Chen, Xiaojian Yuan, Weiming Zhang","In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, research indicates that LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries can induce the generation of harmful content through meticulously crafted prompts. This vulnerability poses significant challenges to the secure use and promotion of LLMs. Existing defense methods offer protection from different perspectives but often suffer from insufficient effectiveness or a significant impact on the model's capabilities. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and easy-to-deploy jailbreak defense framework, namely Prefix Guidance (PG), which guides the model to identify harmful prompts by directly setting the first few tokens of the model's output. This approach combines the model's inherent security capabilities with an external classifier to defend against jailbreak attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PG across three models and five attack methods. Compared to baselines, our approach is generally more effective on average. Additionally, results on the Just-Eval benchmark further confirm PG's superiority to preserve the model's performance. our code is available at https://github.com/weiyezhimeng/Prefix-Guidance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08924v2,2024-08

To facilitate the similarity per scenario and minimize the inner mismatch on P/D (prefill and decoding) processing, fine-grained organization is required, dynamically adjusting P/D ratios for better performance. 2) Due to inaccurate estimation on workload (queue status or maintained connections), the global scheduler easily incurs unnecessary timeouts in prefill. 3) Block-fixed device-to-device (D2D) KVCache transfer over cluster-level RDMA (remote direct memory access) fails to achieve desired D2D utilization as expected. To overcome previous problems, this paper proposes an end-to-end system P/D-Serve, complying with the paradigm of MLOps (machine learning operations), which models end-to-end (E2E) P/D performance and enables: 1) fine-grained P/D organization, mapping the service with RoCE (RDMA over converged ethernet) as needed, to facilitate similar processing and dynamic adjustments on P/D ratios; 2) on-demand forwarding upon rejections for idle prefill, decoupling the scheduler from regular inaccurate reports and local queues, to avoid timeouts in prefill; and 3) efficient KVCache transfer via optimized D2D access. P/D-Serve is implemented upon Ascend and MindSpore, has been deployed over tens of thousands of NPUs for more than eight months in commercial use, and further achieves 60\%, 42\% and 46\% improvements on E2E throughput, time-to-first-token (TTFT) SLO (service level objective) and D2D transfer time. As the E2E system with optimizations, P/D-Serve achieves 6.7x increase on throughput, compared with aggregated LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08147v1,2024-08
KOALA: Enhancing Speculative Decoding for LLM via Multi-Layer Draft Heads with Adversarial Learning,"Kaiqi Zhang, Jing Zhao, Rui Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit high inference latency due to their autoregressive decoding nature. While the draft head in speculative decoding mitigates this issue, its full potential remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce KOALA (K-layer Optimized Adversarial Learning Architecture), an orthogonal approach to the draft head. By transforming the conventional single-layer draft head into a multi-layer architecture and incorporating adversarial learning into the traditional supervised training, KOALA significantly improves the accuracy of the draft head in predicting subsequent tokens, thus more closely mirroring the functionality of LLMs. Although this improvement comes at the cost of slightly increased drafting overhead, KOALA substantially unlocks the draft head's potential, greatly enhancing speculative decoding. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of KOALA, including both autoregressive and non-autoregressive draft heads across various tasks, demonstrating a latency speedup ratio improvement of 0.24x-0.41x, which is 10.57%-14.09% faster than the original draft heads.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08146v1,2024-08
"MIDAS: Multi-level Intent, Domain, And Slot Knowledge Distillation for Multi-turn NLU","Yan Li, So-Eon Kim, Seong-Bae Park, Soyeon Caren Han","Although Large Language Models(LLMs) can generate coherent and contextually relevant text, they often struggle to recognise the intent behind the human user's query. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models, however, interpret the purpose and key information of user's input to enable responsive interactions. Existing NLU models generally map individual utterances to a dual-level semantic frame, involving sentence-level intent and word-level slot labels. However, real-life conversations primarily consist of multi-turn conversations, involving the interpretation of complex and extended dialogues. Researchers encounter challenges addressing all facets of multi-turn dialogue conversations using a unified single NLU model. This paper introduces a novel approach, MIDAS, leveraging a multi-level intent, domain, and slot knowledge distillation for multi-turn NLU. To achieve this, we construct distinct teachers for varying levels of conversation knowledge, namely, sentence-level intent detection, word-level slot filling, and conversation-level domain classification. These teachers are then fine-tuned to acquire specific knowledge of their designated levels. A multi-teacher loss is proposed to facilitate the combination of these multi-level teachers, guiding a student model in multi-turn dialogue tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our model in improving the overall multi-turn conversation understanding, showcasing the potential for advancements in NLU models through the incorporation of multi-level dialogue knowledge distillation techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08144v1,2024-08
Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey,"Boci Peng, Yun Zhu, Yongchao Liu, Xiaohe Bo, Haizhou Shi, Chuntao Hong, Yan Zhang, Siliang Tang","Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has achieved remarkable success in addressing the challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs) without necessitating retraining. By referencing an external knowledge base, RAG refines LLM outputs, effectively mitigating issues such as ``hallucination'', lack of domain-specific knowledge, and outdated information. However, the complex structure of relationships among different entities in databases presents challenges for RAG systems. In response, GraphRAG leverages structural information across entities to enable more precise and comprehensive retrieval, capturing relational knowledge and facilitating more accurate, context-aware responses. Given the novelty and potential of GraphRAG, a systematic review of current technologies is imperative. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of GraphRAG methodologies. We formalize the GraphRAG workflow, encompassing Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. We then outline the core technologies and training methods at each stage.

AgentCourt: Simulating Court with Adversarial Evolvable Lawyer Agents,"Guhong Chen, Liyang Fan, Zihan Gong, Nan Xie, Zixuan Li, Ziqiang Liu, Chengming Li, Qiang Qu, Shiwen Ni, Min Yang","In this paper, we present a simulation system called AgentCourt that simulates the entire courtroom process. The judge, plaintiff's lawyer, defense lawyer, and other participants are autonomous agents driven by large language models (LLMs). Our core goal is to enable lawyer agents to learn how to argue a case, as well as improving their overall legal skills, through courtroom process simulation. To achieve this goal, we propose an adversarial evolutionary approach for the lawyer-agent. Since AgentCourt can simulate the occurrence and development of court hearings based on a knowledge base and LLM, the lawyer agents can continuously learn and accumulate experience from real court cases. The simulation experiments show that after two lawyer-agents have engaged in a thousand adversarial legal cases in AgentCourt (which can take a decade for real-world lawyers), compared to their pre-evolutionary state, the evolved lawyer agents exhibit consistent improvement in their ability to handle legal tasks. To enhance the credibility of our experimental results, we enlisted a panel of professional lawyers to evaluate our simulations. The evaluation indicates that the evolved lawyer agents exhibit notable advancements in responsiveness, as well as expertise and logical rigor.

Extracting Sentence Embeddings from Pretrained Transformer Models,"Lukas Stankevičius, Mantas Lukoševičius","Background/introduction: Pre-trained transformer models shine in many natural language processing tasks and therefore are expected to bear the representation of the input sentence or text meaning. These sentence-level embeddings are also important in retrieval-augmented generation. But do commonly used plain averaging or prompt templates surface it enough?   Methods: Given 110M parameters BERT's hidden representations from multiple layers and multiple tokens we tried various ways to extract optimal sentence representations. We tested various token aggregation and representation post-processing techniques. We also tested multiple ways of using a general Wikitext dataset to complement BERTs sentence representations. All methods were tested on 8 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), 6 short text clustering, and 12 classification tasks. We also evaluated our representation-shaping techniques on other static models, including random token representations.   Results: Proposed representation extraction methods improved the performance on STS and clustering tasks for all models considered. Very high improvements for static token-based models, especially random embeddings for STS tasks almost reach the performance of BERT-derived representations.   Conclusions: Our work shows that for multiple tasks simple baselines with representation shaping techniques reach or even outperform more complex BERT-based models or are able to contribute to their performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08073v1,2024-08

Some approaches train LLMs using their own generated synthetic data, exploring the possibility of active alignment.

Text2BIM: Generating Building Models Using a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Framework,"Changyu Du, Sebastian Esser, Stavros Nousias, André Borrmann","The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools. This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions. This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software. Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework.

We adopt a pre-trained Whisper encoder as an audio encoder, and the audio embeddings from the audio encoder are projected to the text embedding space by an adapter layer and concatenated with text embeddings converted from text prompts to form inputs to the decoder.

Leveraging Web-Crawled Data for High-Quality Fine-Tuning,"Jing Zhou, Chenglin Jiang, Wei Shen, Xiao Zhou, Xiaonan He","Most large language models are fine-tuned using either expensive human-annotated data or GPT-4 generated data which cannot guarantee performance in certain domains. We argue that although the web-crawled data often has formatting errors causing semantic inaccuracies, it can still serve as a valuable source for high-quality supervised fine-tuning in specific domains without relying on advanced models like GPT-4. To this end, we create a paired training dataset automatically by aligning web-crawled data with a smaller set of high-quality data. By training a language model on this dataset, we can convert web data with irregular formats into high-quality ones. Our experiments show that training with the model-transformed data yields better results, surpassing training with only high-quality data by an average score of 9.4% in Chinese math problems. Additionally, our 7B model outperforms several open-source models larger than 32B and surpasses well-known closed-source models such as GPT-3.5, highlighting the efficacy of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08003v1,2024-08
FuseChat: Knowledge Fusion of Chat Models,"Fanqi Wan, Longguang Zhong, Ziyi Yang, Ruijun Chen, Xiaojun Quan","While training large language models (LLMs) from scratch can indeed lead to models with distinct capabilities and strengths, it incurs substantial costs and may lead to redundancy in competencies. Knowledge fusion aims to integrate existing LLMs of diverse architectures and capabilities into a more potent LLM through lightweight continual training, thereby reducing the need for costly LLM development. In this work, we propose a new framework for the knowledge fusion of chat LLMs through two main stages, resulting in FuseChat. Firstly, we conduct pairwise knowledge fusion on source chat LLMs of varying structures and scales to create multiple target LLMs with identical structure and size via lightweight fine-tuning. During this process, a statistics-based token alignment approach is introduced as the cornerstone for fusing LLMs with different structures. Secondly, we merge these target LLMs within the parameter space, where we propose a novel method for determining the merging coefficients based on the magnitude of parameter updates before and after fine-tuning. We implement and validate FuseChat using six prominent chat LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, including OpenChat-3.5-7B, Starling-LM-7B-alpha, NH2-SOLAR-10.7B, InternLM2-Chat-20B, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, and Qwen-1.5-Chat-72B.

In this work, we aim to analyze the capabilities required to solve legal problems in Arabic and benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs. We explore the impact of in-context learning and investigate various evaluation methods. Additionally, we explore workflows for generating questions with automatic validation to enhance the dataset's quality. We benchmark multilingual and Arabic-centric LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Jais, respectively. We also share our methodology for creating the dataset and validation, which can be generalized to other domains. We hope to accelerate AI research in the Arabic Legal domain by releasing the ArabLegalEval dataset and code: https://github.com/Thiqah/ArabLegalEval",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07983v1,2024-08
Coupling without Communication and Drafter-Invariant Speculative Decoding,"Majid Daliri, Christopher Musco, Ananda Theertha Suresh","Suppose Alice has a distribution $P$ and Bob has a distribution $Q$. Alice wants to generate a sample $a\sim P$ and Bob a sample $b \sim Q$ such that $a = b$ with has as high of probability as possible. It is well-known that, by sampling from an optimal coupling between the distributions, Alice and Bob can achieve $Pr[a = b] = 1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)$, where $D_{TV}(P,Q)$ is the total variation distance. What if Alice and Bob must solve this same problem without communicating at all? Perhaps surprisingly, with access to public randomness, they can still achieve $Pr[a=b] \geq \frac{1-D_{TV}(P,Q)}{1+D_{TV}(P,Q)} \geq 1-2D_{TV}(P,Q)$. In fact, this bound can be obtained using a simple protocol based on the Weighted MinHash algorithm. In this work, we explore the communication-free coupling problem in greater depth. First, we show that an equally simple protocol based on Gumbel sampling matches the worst-case guarantees of the Weighted MinHash approach, but tends to perform better in practice. Conversely, we prove that both approaches are actually sharp: no communication-free protocol can achieve $Pr[a=b]>\frac{1-D_{TV}(P,Q)}{1+D_{TV}(P,Q)}$ in the worst-case. Finally, we prove that, for distributions over $n$ items, there exists a scheme that uses just $O(\log(n/\epsilon))$ bits of communication to achieve $Pr[a = b] = 1 - D_{TV}(P,Q) - \epsilon$, i.e. to essentially match optimal coupling. Beyond our theoretical results, we demonstrate an application of communication-free coupling to speculative decoding, a recent method for accelerating autoregressive large language models [Leviathan, Kalman, Matias, ICML 2023]. We show that communication-free protocols yield a variant of speculative decoding that we call Drafter-Invariant Speculative Decoding, which has the desirable property that the output of the method is fixed given a fixed random seed, regardless of what drafter is used for speculation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07978v2,2024-08
Polaris: Open-ended Interactive Robotic Manipulation via Syn2Real Visual Grounding and Large Language Models,"Tianyu Wang, Haitao Lin, Junqiu Yu, Yanwei Fu","This paper investigates the task of the open-ended interactive robotic manipulation on table-top scenarios. While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance robots' comprehension of user instructions, their lack of visual grounding constrains their ability to physically interact with the environment. This is because the robot needs to locate the target object for manipulation within the physical workspace. To this end, we introduce an interactive robotic manipulation framework called Polaris, which integrates perception and interaction by utilizing GPT-4 alongside grounded vision models. For precise manipulation, it is essential that such grounded vision models produce detailed object pose for the target object, rather than merely identifying pixels belonging to them in the image. Consequently, we propose a novel Synthetic-to-Real (Syn2Real) pose estimation pipeline. This pipeline utilizes rendered synthetic data for training and is then transferred to real-world manipulation tasks. The real-world performance demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed pipeline and underscores its potential for extension to more general categories. Moreover, real-robot experiments have showcased the impressive performance of our framework in grasping and executing multiple manipulation tasks. This indicates its potential to generalize to scenarios beyond the tabletop.

Predicting Lung Cancer Patient Prognosis with Large Language Models,"Danqing Hu, Bing Liu, Xiang Li, Xiaofeng Zhu, Nan Wu","Prognosis prediction is crucial for determining optimal treatment plans for lung cancer patients. Traditionally, such predictions relied on models developed from retrospective patient data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained attention for their ability to process and generate text based on extensive learned knowledge. In this study, we evaluate the potential of GPT-4o mini and GPT-3.5 in predicting the prognosis of lung cancer patients. We collected two prognosis datasets, i.e., survival and post-operative complication datasets, and designed multiple tasks to assess the models' performance comprehensively. Logistic regression models were also developed as baselines for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can achieve competitive, and in some tasks superior, performance in lung cancer prognosis prediction compared to data-driven logistic regression models despite not using additional patient data. These findings suggest that LLMs can be effective tools for prognosis prediction in lung cancer, particularly when patient data is limited or unavailable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07971v1,2024-08
GERestaurant: A German Dataset of Annotated Restaurant Reviews for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Nils Constantin Hellwig, Jakob Fehle, Markus Bink, Christian Wolff","We present GERestaurant, a novel dataset consisting of 3,078 German language restaurant reviews manually annotated for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). All reviews were collected from Tripadvisor, covering a diverse selection of restaurants, including regional and international cuisine with various culinary styles. The annotations encompass both implicit and explicit aspects, including all aspect terms, their corresponding aspect categories, and the sentiments expressed towards them. Furthermore, we provide baseline scores for the four ABSA tasks Aspect Category Detection, Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis, End-to-End ABSA and Target Aspect Sentiment Detection as a reference point for future advances.

MAG-SQL: Multi-Agent Generative Approach with Soft Schema Linking and Iterative Sub-SQL Refinement for Text-to-SQL,"Wenxuan Xie, Gaochen Wu, Bowen Zhou","Recent In-Context Learning based methods have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-SQL task. However, there is still a large gap between the performance of these models and human performance on datasets with complex database schema and difficult questions, such as BIRD. Besides, existing work has neglected to supervise intermediate steps when solving questions iteratively with question decomposition methods, and the schema linking methods used in these works are very rudimentary. To address these issues, we propose MAG-SQL, a multi-agent generative approach with soft schema linking and iterative Sub-SQL refinement. In our framework, an entity-based method with tables' summary is used to select the columns in database, and a novel targets-conditions decomposition method is introduced to decompose those complex questions. Additionally, we build a iterative generating module which includes a Sub-SQL Generator and Sub-SQL Refiner, introducing external oversight for each step of generation. Through a series of ablation studies, the effectiveness of each agent in our framework has been demonstrated. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with GPT-4, MAG-SQL achieves an execution accuracy of 61.08%, compared to the baseline accuracy of 46.35% for vanilla GPT-4 and the baseline accuracy of 57.56% for MAC-SQL. Besides, our approach makes similar progress on Spider. The codes are available at https://github.com/LancelotXWX/MAG-SQL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07930v4,2024-08
Plan with Code: Comparing approaches for robust NL to DSL generation,"Nastaran Bassamzadeh, Chhaya Methani","Planning in code is considered a more reliable approach for many orchestration tasks. This is because code is more tractable than steps generated via Natural Language and make it easy to support more complex sequences by abstracting deterministic logic into functions. It also allows spotting issues with incorrect function names with the help of parsing checks that can be run on code. Progress in Code Generation methodologies, however, remains limited to general-purpose languages like C, C++, and Python. LLMs continue to face challenges with custom function names in Domain Specific Languages or DSLs, leading to higher hallucination rates and syntax errors. This is more common for custom function names, that are typically part of the plan. Moreover, keeping LLMs up-to-date with newer function names is an issue. This poses a challenge for scenarios like task planning over a large number of APIs, since the plan is represented as a DSL having custom API names. In this paper, we focus on workflow automation in RPA (Robotic Process Automation) domain as a special case of task planning. We present optimizations for using Retrieval Augmented Generation (or RAG) with LLMs for DSL generation along with an ablation study comparing these strategies with a fine-tuned model. Our results showed that the fine-tuned model scored the best on code similarity metric. However, with our optimizations, RAG approach is able to match the quality for in-domain API names in the test set. Additionally, it offers significant advantage for out-of-domain or unseen API names, outperforming Fine-Tuned model on similarity metric by 7 pts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08335v1,2024-08
When Raw Data Prevails: Are Large Language Model Embeddings Effective in Numerical Data Representation for Medical Machine Learning Applications?,"Yanjun Gao, Skatje Myers, Shan Chen, Dmitriy Dligach, Timothy A Miller, Danielle Bitterman, Matthew Churpek, Majid Afshar","The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has advanced data representation and analysis, bringing significant progress in their use for medical questions and answering. Despite these advancements, integrating tabular data, especially numerical data pivotal in clinical contexts, into LLM paradigms has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of vector representations from last hidden states of LLMs for medical diagnostics and prognostics using electronic health record (EHR) data. We compare the performance of these embeddings with that of raw numerical EHR data when used as feature inputs to traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms that excel at tabular data learning, such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting. We focus on instruction-tuned LLMs in a zero-shot setting to represent abnormal physiological data and evaluating their utilities as feature extractors to enhance ML classifiers for predicting diagnoses, length of stay, and mortality. Furthermore, we examine prompt engineering techniques on zero-shot and few-shot LLM embeddings to measure their impact comprehensively. Although findings suggest the raw data features still prevails in medical ML tasks, zero-shot LLM embeddings demonstrate competitive results, suggesting a promising avenue for future research in medical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11854v2,2024-08
DM2RM: Dual-Mode Multimodal Ranking for Target Objects and Receptacles Based on Open-Vocabulary Instructions,"Ryosuke Korekata, Kanta Kaneda, Shunya Nagashima, Yuto Imai, Komei Sugiura","In this study, we aim to develop a domestic service robot (DSR) that, guided by open-vocabulary instructions, can carry everyday objects to the specified pieces of furniture. Few existing methods handle mobile manipulation tasks with open-vocabulary instructions in the image retrieval setting, and most do not identify both the target objects and the receptacles. We propose the Dual-Mode Multimodal Ranking model (DM2RM), which enables images of both the target objects and receptacles to be retrieved using a single model based on multimodal foundation models. We introduce a switching mechanism that leverages a mode token and phrase identification via a large language model to switch the embedding space based on the prediction target. To evaluate the DM2RM, we construct a novel dataset including real-world images collected from hundreds of building-scale environments and crowd-sourced instructions with referring expressions. The evaluation results show that the proposed DM2RM outperforms previous approaches in terms of standard metrics in image retrieval settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of the DM2RM on a standardized real-world DSR platform including fetch-and-carry actions, where it achieves a task success rate of 82% despite the zero-shot transfer setting.

Assessing Language Models' Worldview for Fiction Generation,"Aisha Khatun, Daniel G. Brown","The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become ubiquitous, with abundant applications in computational creativity. One such application is fictional story generation. Fiction is a narrative that occurs in a story world that is slightly different than ours. With LLMs becoming writing partners, we question how suitable they are to generate fiction. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to maintain a state of world essential to generate fiction. Through a series of questions to nine LLMs, we find that only two models exhibit consistent worldview, while the rest are self-conflicting. Subsequent analysis of stories generated by four models revealed a strikingly uniform narrative pattern. This uniformity across models further suggests a lack of `state' necessary for fiction. We highlight the limitations of current LLMs in fiction writing and advocate for future research to test and create story worlds for LLMs to reside in. All code, dataset, and the generated responses can be found in https://github.com/tanny411/llm-reliability-and-consistency-evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07904v1,2024-08
Cross-Modal Denoising: A Novel Training Paradigm for Enhancing Speech-Image Retrieval,"Lifeng Zhou, Yuke Li, Rui Deng, Yuting Yang, Haoqi Zhu","The success of speech-image retrieval relies on establishing an effective alignment between speech and image. Existing methods often model cross-modal interaction through simple cosine similarity of the global feature of each modality, which fall short in capturing fine-grained details within modalities. To address this issue, we introduce an effective framework and a novel learning task named cross-modal denoising (CMD) to enhance cross-modal interaction to achieve finer-level cross-modal alignment. Specifically, CMD is a denoising task designed to reconstruct semantic features from noisy features within one modality by interacting features from another modality. Notably, CMD operates exclusively during model training and can be removed during inference without adding extra inference time. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 2.0% in mean R@1 on the Flickr8k dataset and by 1.7% in mean R@1 on the SpokenCOCO dataset for the speech-image retrieval tasks, respectively. These experimental results validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13705v2,2024-08
Evaluating Fine-Tuning Efficiency of Human-Inspired Learning Strategies in Medical Question Answering,"Yushi Yang, Andrew M. Bean, Robert McCraith, Adam Mahdi","Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) incurs considerable training costs, driving the need for data-efficient training with optimised data ordering. Human-inspired strategies offer a solution by organising data based on human learning practices. This study evaluates the fine-tuning efficiency of five human-inspired strategies across four language models, three datasets, and both human- and LLM-labelled data in the context of medical question answering. These strategies achieve the best accuracy gain of 1.81% and an average gain of 1.02% across datasets, with interleaved strategies delivering the best average results. However, the best strategy varies across model-dataset combinations, limiting the generalisability of the effects of any single strategy. Additionally, LLM-defined question difficulty outperforms human-defined labels in curriculum-based learning, showing the potential of model-generated data as a cost-effective alternative for optimising fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07888v2,2024-08
Coarse-to-fine Alignment Makes Better Speech-image Retrieval,"Lifeng Zhou, Yuke Li","In this paper, we propose a novel framework for speech-image retrieval. We utilize speech-image contrastive (SIC) learning tasks to align speech and image representations at a coarse level and speech-image matching (SIM) learning tasks to further refine the fine-grained cross-modal alignment. SIC and SIM learning tasks are jointly trained in a unified manner. To optimize the learning process, we utilize an embedding queue that facilitates efficient sampling of high-quality and diverse negative representations during SIC learning. Additionally, it enhances the learning of SIM tasks by effectively mining hard negatives based on contrastive similarities calculated in SIC tasks. To further optimize learning under noisy supervision, we incorporate momentum distillation into the training process. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 4% in R@1 on two benchmark datasets for the speech-image retrieval tasks. Moreover, as observed in zero-shot experiments, our framework demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13119v2,2024-08
Instruct Large Language Models to Generate Scientific Literature Survey Step by Step,"Yuxuan Lai, Yupeng Wu, Yidan Wang, Wenpeng Hu, Chen Zheng","Abstract. Automatically generating scientific literature surveys is a valuable task that can significantly enhance research efficiency. However, the diverse and complex nature of information within a literature survey poses substantial challenges for generative models. In this paper, we design a series of prompts to systematically leverage large language models (LLMs), enabling the creation of comprehensive literature surveys through a step-by-step approach. Specifically, we design prompts to guide LLMs to sequentially generate the title, abstract, hierarchical headings, and the main content of the literature survey. We argue that this design enables the generation of the headings from a high-level perspective. During the content generation process, this design effectively harnesses relevant information while minimizing costs by restricting the length of both input and output content in LLM queries. Our implementation with Qwen-long achieved third place in the NLPCC 2024 Scientific Literature Survey Generation evaluation task, with an overall score only 0.03% lower than the second-place team. Additionally, our soft heading recall is 95.84%, the second best among the submissions. Thanks to the efficient prompt design and the low cost of the Qwen-long API, our method reduces the expense for generating each literature survey to 0.1 RMB, enhancing the practical value of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07884v1,2024-08
PyMarian: Fast Neural Machine Translation and Evaluation in Python,"Thamme Gowda, Roman Grundkiewicz, Elijah Rippeth, Matt Post, Marcin Junczys-Dowmunt","The deep learning language of choice these days is Python; measured by factors such as available libraries and technical support, it is hard to beat. At the same time, software written in lower-level programming languages like C++ retain advantages in speed. We describe a Python interface to Marian NMT, a C++-based training and inference toolkit for sequence-to-sequence models, focusing on machine translation. This interface enables models trained with Marian to be connected to the rich, wide range of tools available in Python. A highlight of the interface is the ability to compute state-of-the-art COMET metrics from Python but using Marian's inference engine, with a speedup factor of up to 7.8$\times$ the existing implementations. We also briefly spotlight a number of other integrations, including Jupyter notebooks, connection with prebuilt models, and a web app interface provided with the package.

Words Matter: Reducing Stigma in Online Conversations about Substance Use with Large Language Models,"Layla Bouzoubaa, Elham Aghakhani, Rezvaneh Rezapour","Stigma is a barrier to treatment for individuals struggling with substance use disorders (SUD), which leads to significantly lower treatment engagement rates. With only 7% of those affected receiving any form of help, societal stigma not only discourages individuals with SUD from seeking help but isolates them, hindering their recovery journey and perpetuating a cycle of shame and self-doubt. This study investigates how stigma manifests on social media, particularly Reddit, where anonymity can exacerbate discriminatory behaviors. We analyzed over 1.2 million posts, identifying 3,207 that exhibited stigmatizing language towards people who use substances (PWUS). Using Informed and Stylized LLMs, we develop a model for de-stigmatization of these expressions into empathetic language, resulting in 1,649 reformed phrase pairs. Our paper contributes to the field by proposing a computational framework for analyzing stigma and destigmatizing online content, and delving into the linguistic features that propagate stigma towards PWUS. Our work not only enhances understanding of stigma's manifestations online but also provides practical tools for fostering a more supportive digital environment for those affected by SUD.

Hallucinations come in many forms, and there is no universally accepted definition. We thus focus on studying only those hallucinations where a correct answer appears verbatim in the training set. To fully control the training data content, we construct a knowledge graph (KG)-based dataset, and use it to train a set of increasingly large LMs. We find that for a fixed dataset, larger and longer-trained LMs hallucinate less. However, hallucinating on $\leq5$% of the training data requires an order of magnitude larger model, and thus an order of magnitude more compute, than Hoffmann et al. (2022) reported was optimal. Given this costliness, we study how hallucination detectors depend on scale. While we see detector size improves performance on fixed LM's outputs, we find an inverse relationship between the scale of the LM and the detectability of its hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07852v1,2024-08
SER Evals: In-domain and Out-of-domain Benchmarking for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Mohamed Osman, Daniel Z. Kaplan, Tamer Nadeem","Speech emotion recognition (SER) has made significant strides with the advent of powerful self-supervised learning (SSL) models. However, the generalization of these models to diverse languages and emotional expressions remains a challenge. We propose a large-scale benchmark to evaluate the robustness and adaptability of state-of-the-art SER models in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our benchmark includes a diverse set of multilingual datasets, focusing on less commonly used corpora to assess generalization to new data. We employ logit adjustment to account for varying class distributions and establish a single dataset cluster for systematic evaluation. Surprisingly, we find that the Whisper model, primarily designed for automatic speech recognition, outperforms dedicated SSL models in cross-lingual SER. Our results highlight the need for more robust and generalizable SER models, and our benchmark serves as a valuable resource to drive future research in this direction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07851v1,2024-08
CodeMirage: Hallucinations in Code Generated by Large Language Models,"Vibhor Agarwal, Yulong Pei, Salwa Alamir, Xiaomo Liu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potentials in program generation and no-code automation. However, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, i.e., they generate text which sounds plausible but is incorrect. Although there has been a recent surge in research on LLM hallucinations for text generation, similar hallucination phenomenon can happen in code generation. Sometimes the generated code can have syntactical or logical errors as well as more advanced issues like security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, etc. Given the wide adaptation of LLMs to enhance efficiency in code generation and development in general, it becomes imperative to investigate hallucinations in code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at studying hallucinations in the code generated by LLMs. We start by introducing the code hallucination definition and a comprehensive taxonomy of code hallucination types. We propose the first benchmark CodeMirage dataset for code hallucinations. The benchmark contains 1,137 GPT-3.5 generated hallucinated code snippets for Python programming problems from two base datasets - HumanEval and MBPP. We then propose the methodology for code hallucination detection and experiment with open source LLMs such as CodeLLaMA as well as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models using one-shot prompt. We find that GPT-4 performs the best on HumanEval dataset and gives comparable results to the fine-tuned CodeBERT baseline on MBPP dataset. Towards the end, we discuss various mitigation strategies for code hallucinations and conclude our work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08333v1,2024-08
ONSEP: A Novel Online Neural-Symbolic Framework for Event Prediction Based on Large Language Model,"Xuanqing Yu, Wangtao Sun, Jingwei Li, Kang Liu, Chengbao Liu, Jie Tan","In the realm of event prediction, temporal knowledge graph forecasting (TKGF) stands as a pivotal technique. Previous approaches face the challenges of not utilizing experience during testing and relying on a single short-term history, which limits adaptation to evolving data. In this paper, we introduce the Online Neural-Symbolic Event Prediction (ONSEP) framework, which innovates by integrating dynamic causal rule mining (DCRM) and dual history augmented generation (DHAG). DCRM dynamically constructs causal rules from real-time data, allowing for swift adaptation to new causal relationships. In parallel, DHAG merges short-term and long-term historical contexts, leveraging a bi-branch approach to enrich event prediction. Our framework demonstrates notable performance enhancements across diverse datasets, with significant Hit@k (k=1,3,10) improvements, showcasing its ability to augment large language models (LLMs) for event prediction without necessitating extensive retraining.

The Death of Schema Linking? Text-to-SQL in the Age of Well-Reasoned Language Models,"Karime Maamari, Fadhil Abubaker, Daniel Jaroslawicz, Amine Mhedhbi","Schema linking is a crucial step in Text-to-SQL pipelines. Its goal is to retrieve the relevant tables and columns of a target database for a user's query while disregarding irrelevant ones. However, imperfect schema linking can often exclude required columns needed for accurate query generation. In this work, we revisit schema linking when using the latest generation of large language models (LLMs). We find empirically that newer models are adept at utilizing relevant schema elements during generation even in the presence of large numbers of irrelevant ones. As such, our Text-to-SQL pipeline entirely forgoes schema linking in cases where the schema fits within the model's context window in order to minimize issues due to filtering required schema elements. Furthermore, instead of filtering contextual information, we highlight techniques such as augmentation, selection, and correction, and adopt them to improve the accuracy of our Text-to-SQL pipeline. Our approach ranks first on the BIRD benchmark achieving an accuracy of 71.83%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07702v2,2024-08
Quantifying over Optimum Answer Sets,"Giuseppe Mazzotta, Francesco Ricca, Mirek Truszczynski","Answer Set Programming with Quantifiers (ASP(Q)) has been introduced to provide a natural extension of ASP modeling to problems in the polynomial hierarchy (PH). However, ASP(Q) lacks a method for encoding in an elegant and compact way problems requiring a polynomial number of calls to an oracle in $\Sigma_n^p$ (that is, problems in $\Delta_{n+1}^p$). Such problems include, in particular, optimization problems. In this paper we propose an extension of ASP(Q), in which component programs may contain weak constraints. Weak constraints can be used both for expressing local optimization within quantified component programs and for modeling global optimization criteria.

Further, we study its computational properties obtaining complexity results and unveiling non-obvious characteristics of ASP(Q) programs with weak constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07697v1,2024-08

Alignment-Enhanced Decoding:Defending via Token-Level Adaptive Refining of Probability Distributions,"Quan Liu, Zhenhong Zhou, Longzhu He, Yi Liu, Wei Zhang, Sen Su","Large language models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can result in the generation of harmful content. While prior defenses mitigate these risks by perturbing or inspecting inputs, they ignore competing objectives, the underlying cause of alignment failures. In this paper, we propose Alignment-Enhanced Decoding (AED), a novel defense that employs adaptive decoding to address the root causes of jailbreak issues. We first define the Competitive Index to quantify alignment failures and utilize feedback from self-evaluation to compute post-alignment logits. Then, AED adaptively combines AED and post-alignment logits with the original logits to obtain harmless and helpful distributions. Consequently, our method enhances safety alignment while maintaining helpfulness.

See It All: Contextualized Late Aggregation for 3D Dense Captioning,"Minjung Kim, Hyung Suk Lim, Seung Hwan Kim, Soonyoung Lee, Bumsoo Kim, Gunhee Kim","3D dense captioning is a task to localize objects in a 3D scene and generate descriptive sentences for each object. Recent approaches in 3D dense captioning have adopted transformer encoder-decoder frameworks from object detection to build an end-to-end pipeline without hand-crafted components. However, these approaches struggle with contradicting objectives where a single query attention has to simultaneously view both the tightly localized object regions and contextual environment. To overcome this challenge, we introduce SIA (See-It-All), a transformer pipeline that engages in 3D dense captioning with a novel paradigm called late aggregation. SIA simultaneously decodes two sets of queries-context query and instance query. The instance query focuses on localization and object attribute descriptions, while the context query versatilely captures the region-of-interest of relationships between multiple objects or with the global scene, then aggregated afterwards (i.e., late aggregation) via simple distance-based measures. To further enhance the quality of contextualized caption generation, we design a novel aggregator to generate a fully informed caption based on the surrounding context, the global environment, and object instances. Extensive experiments on two of the most widely-used 3D dense captioning datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a significant improvement over prior methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07648v1,2024-08
Hierarchical Working Memory and a New Magic Number,"Weishun Zhong, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks","The extremely limited working memory span, typically around four items, contrasts sharply with our everyday experience of processing much larger streams of sensory information concurrently. This disparity suggests that working memory can organize information into compact representations such as chunks, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we propose a recurrent neural network model for chunking within the framework of the synaptic theory of working memory. We showed that by selectively suppressing groups of stimuli, the network can maintain and retrieve the stimuli in chunks, hence exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material. Our work provides a novel conceptual and analytical framework for understanding the on-the-fly organization of information in the brain that is crucial for cognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07637v1,2024-08
WeKnow-RAG: An Adaptive Approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Integrating Web Search and Knowledge Graphs,"Weijian Xie, Xuefeng Liang, Yuhui Liu, Kaihua Ni, Hong Cheng, Zetian Hu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly contributed to the development of adaptive intelligent agents and are positioned as an important way to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, LLMs are prone to produce factually incorrect information and often produce ""phantom"" content that undermines their reliability, which poses a serious challenge for their deployment in real-world scenarios. Enhancing LLMs by combining external databases and information retrieval mechanisms is an effective path. To address the above challenges, we propose a new approach called WeKnow-RAG, which integrates Web search and Knowledge Graphs into a ""Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)"" system. First, the accuracy and reliability of LLM responses are improved by combining the structured representation of Knowledge Graphs with the flexibility of dense vector retrieval. WeKnow-RAG then utilizes domain-specific knowledge graphs to satisfy a variety of queries and domains, thereby improving performance on factual information and complex reasoning tasks by employing multi-stage web page retrieval techniques using both sparse and dense retrieval methods. Our approach effectively balances the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval, thus improving the overall retrieval process. Finally, we also integrate a self-assessment mechanism for the LLM to evaluate the trustworthiness of the answers it generates. Our approach proves its outstanding effectiveness in a wide range of offline experiments and online submissions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07611v2,2024-08
Assessing the Role of Lexical Semantics in Cross-lingual Transfer through Controlled Manipulations,"Roy Ilani, Taelin Karidi, Omri Abend","While cross-linguistic model transfer is effective in many settings, there is still limited understanding of the conditions under which it works. In this paper, we focus on assessing the role of lexical semantics in cross-lingual transfer, as we compare its impact to that of other language properties. Examining each language property individually, we systematically analyze how differences between English and a target language influence the capacity to align the language with an English pretrained representation space. We do so by artificially manipulating the English sentences in ways that mimic specific characteristics of the target language, and reporting the effect of each manipulation on the quality of alignment with the representation space. We show that while properties such as the script or word order only have a limited impact on alignment quality, the degree of lexical matching between the two languages, which we define using a measure of translation entropy, greatly affects it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07599v1,2024-08

Multimodal visual-textual mathematical reasoning serves as a critical indicator for evaluating the comprehension and complex multi-step quantitative reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, previous multimodal math benchmarks have not sufficiently integrated visual and textual information. To address this gap, we proposed MathScape, a new benchmark that emphasizes the understanding and application of combined visual and textual information. MathScape is designed to evaluate photo-based math problem scenarios, assessing the theoretical understanding and application ability of MLLMs through a categorical hierarchical approach.

Development of a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Clinical Decision Support System for Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS)-Based Triage and Treatment Planning in Emergency Departments,"Seungjun Han, Wongyung Choi","Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and the complexity of rapid decision-making in critical care settings pose significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have shown promise, the integration of large language models (LLMs) offers new possibilities for enhancing triage accuracy and clinical decision-making. This study presents an LLM-driven CDSS designed to assist ED physicians and nurses in patient triage, treatment planning, and overall emergency care management.   We developed a multi-agent CDSS utilizing Llama-3-70b as the base LLM, orchestrated by CrewAI and Langchain. The system comprises four AI agents emulating key ED roles: Triage Nurse, Emergency Physician, Pharmacist, and ED Coordinator. It incorporates the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) for triage assessment and integrates with the RxNorm API for medication management.   The model was evaluated using the Asclepius dataset, with performance assessed by a clinical emergency medicine specialist. The CDSS demonstrated high accuracy in triage decision-making compared to the baseline of a single-agent system. Furthermore, the system exhibited strong performance in critical areas, including primary diagnosis, critical findings identification, disposition decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation.   Our multi-agent CDSS demonstrates significant potential for supporting comprehensive emergency care management. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies, this system offers a scalable and adaptable tool that could enhance emergency medical care delivery, potentially alleviating ED overcrowding and improving patient outcomes.

Large Language Models Know What Makes Exemplary Contexts,"Quanyu Long, Jianda Chen, Wenya Wang, Sinno Jialin Pan","In-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a significant capability with the advancement of Large Language models (LLMs). By instructing LLMs using few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide range of tasks without needing to update millions of parameters. This paper presents a unified framework for LLMs that allows them to self-select influential in-context examples to compose their contexts; self-rank candidates with different demonstration compositions; self-optimize the demonstration selection and ordering through reinforcement learning. Specifically, our method designs a parameter-efficient retrieval head that generates the optimized demonstration after training with rewards from LLM's own preference.

While the study of this phenomenon is garnering focus in recent years, the available resources are still relatively scarce, often focusing on different forms or manifestations of biases. The aim of our work is twofold: 1) gather publicly-available datasets and determine how to better combine them to effectively train models in the task of hate speech detection and classification; 2) analyse the main issues with these datasets, such as scarcity, skewed resources, and reliance on non-persistent data. We discuss these issues in tandem with the development of our experiments, in which we show that the combinations of different datasets greatly impact the models' performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07479v1,2024-08
Bridging and Modeling Correlations in Pairwise Data for Direct Preference Optimization,"Yuxin Jiang, Bo Huang, Yufei Wang, Xingshan Zeng, Liangyou Li, Yasheng Wang, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Ruiming Tang, Wei Wang","Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely adopted offline preference optimization algorithm, aims to align large language models (LLMs) with human-desired behaviors using pairwise preference data. However, the winning response and the losing response within pairwise data are generated isolatedly, leading to weak correlations between them as well as suboptimal alignment performance. To address this issue, we propose an effective framework for Bridging and Modeling Correlations in pairwise data, named BMC. Firstly, we increase the consistency and informativeness of the pairwise preference signals through targeted modifications, synthesizing a pseudo-winning response by improving the losing response with the winning response as a reference. Secondly, we identify that DPO alone is insufficient to model these correlations and capture nuanced variations. Therefore, we propose learning token-level correlations by dynamically leveraging the policy model's confidence during training. Comprehensive experiments on QA, math, and instruction-following tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly surpassing competitive baselines, including DPO. Additionally, our in-depth quantitative analysis reveals the reasons behind our method's superior performance over DPO and showcases its versatility to other DPO variants.

Large Language Models Prompting With Episodic Memory,"Dai Do, Quan Tran, Svetha Venkatesh, Hung Le","Prompt optimization is essential for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in scenarios of few-shot learning where training examples are incorporated directly into the prompt. Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07465v1,2024-08
From Brazilian Portuguese to European Portuguese,"João Sanches, Rui Ribeiro, Luísa Coheur","Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese are two varieties of the same language and, despite their close similarities, they exhibit several differences. However, there is a significant disproportion in the availability of resources between the two variants, with Brazilian Portuguese having more abundant resources. This inequity can impact the quality of translation services accessible to European Portuguese speakers. To address this issue, we propose the development of a Brazilian Portuguese to European Portuguese translation system, leveraging recent advancements in neural architectures and models. To evaluate the performance of such systems, we manually curated a gold test set comprising 500 sentences across five different topics. Each sentence in the gold test set has two distinct references, facilitating a straightforward evaluation of future translation models. We experimented with various models by fine-tuning existing Large Language Models using parallel data extracted from movie subtitles and TED Talks transcripts in both Brazilian and European Portuguese. Our evaluation involved the use of conventional automatic metrics as well as a human evaluation. In addition, all models were compared against ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, which currently yields the best results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07457v1,2024-08
Fact or Fiction? Improving Fact Verification with Knowledge Graphs through Simplified Subgraph Retrievals,Tobias A. Opsahl,"Despite recent success in natural language processing (NLP), fact verification still remains a difficult task. Due to misinformation spreading increasingly fast, attention has been directed towards automatically verifying the correctness of claims. In the domain of NLP, this is usually done by training supervised machine learning models to verify claims by utilizing evidence from trustworthy corpora. We present efficient methods for verifying claims on a dataset where the evidence is in the form of structured knowledge graphs. We use the FactKG dataset, which is constructed from the DBpedia knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia. By simplifying the evidence retrieval process, from fine-tuned language models to simple logical retrievals, we are able to construct models that both require less computational resources and achieve better test-set accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07453v1,2024-08

Our end-to-end speech-to-text (ST) system integrates the WavLM speech encoder, a modality adapter, and the Llama2-7B-Base model as the decoder. We employ a two-stage training approach: initially, we align the representations of speech and text, followed by full fine-tuning. Both stages are trained on MuST-c v2 data with cross-entropy loss. We adapt our offline ST model for SST using a simple fixed hold-n policy.

LiveFC: A System for Live Fact-Checking of Audio Streams,"Venktesh V, Vinay Setty","The advances in the digital era have led to rapid dissemination of information. This has also aggravated the spread of misinformation and disinformation. This has potentially serious consequences, such as civil unrest. While fact-checking aims to combat this, manual fact-checking is cumbersome and not scalable. While automated fact-checking approaches exist, they do not operate in real-time and do not always account for spread of misinformation through different modalities. This is particularly important as proactive fact-checking on live streams in real-time can help people be informed of false narratives and prevent catastrophic consequences that may cause civil unrest. This is particularly relevant with the rapid dissemination of information through video on social media platforms or other streams like political rallies and debates. Hence, in this work we develop a platform named LiveFC, that can aid in fact-checking live audio streams in real-time. LiveFC has a user-friendly interface that displays the claims detected along with their veracity and evidence for live streams with associated speakers for claims from respective segments. The app can be accessed at http://livefc.factiverse.ai and a screen recording of the demo can be found at https://bit.ly/3WVAoIw.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07448v2,2024-08

This paper presents a comprehensive case study on the implementation and evaluation of RAG for Arabic text. The work focuses on exploring various semantic embedding models in the retrieval stage and several LLMs in the generation stage, in order to investigate what works and what doesn't in the context of Arabic.

Knowledge in Superposition: Unveiling the Failures of Lifelong Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models,"Chenhui Hu, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","Knowledge editing aims to update outdated or incorrect knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, current knowledge editing methods have limited scalability for lifelong editing. This study explores the fundamental reason why knowledge editing fails in lifelong editing. We begin with the closed-form solution derived from linear associative memory, which underpins state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods. We extend the solution from single editing to lifelong editing, and through rigorous mathematical derivation, identify an interference term in the final solution, suggesting that editing knowledge may impact irrelevant knowledge. Further analysis of the interference term reveals a close relationship with superposition between knowledge representations. When knowledge superposition does not exist in language models, the interference term vanishes, allowing for lossless knowledge editing. Experiments across numerous language models reveal that knowledge superposition is universal, exhibiting high kurtosis, zero mean, and heavy-tailed distributions with clear scaling laws. Ultimately, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that knowledge superposition is the fundamental reason for the failure of lifelong editing. Moreover, this is the first study to investigate knowledge editing from the perspective of superposition and provides a comprehensive observation of superposition across numerous real-world language models.

A Quantum-Inspired Analysis of Human Disambiguation Processes,Daphne Wang,"Formal languages are essential for computer programming and are constructed to be easily processed by computers. In contrast, natural languages are much more challenging and instigated the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). One major obstacle is the ubiquity of ambiguities. Recent advances in NLP have led to the development of large language models, which can resolve ambiguities with high accuracy. At the same time, quantum computers have gained much attention in recent years as they can solve some computational problems faster than classical computers. This new computing paradigm has reached the fields of machine learning and NLP, where hybrid classical-quantum learning algorithms have emerged. However, more research is needed to identify which NLP tasks could benefit from a genuine quantum advantage. In this thesis, we applied formalisms arising from foundational quantum mechanics, such as contextuality and causality, to study ambiguities arising from linguistics. By doing so, we also reproduced psycholinguistic results relating to the human disambiguation process.

DataVisT5: A Pre-trained Language Model for Jointly Understanding Text and Data Visualization,"Zhuoyue Wan, Yuanfeng Song, Shuaimin Li, Chen Jason Zhang, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong","Data visualization (DV) is the fundamental and premise tool to improve the efficiency in conveying the insights behind the big data, which has been widely accepted in existing data-driven world. Task automation in DV, such as converting natural language queries to visualizations (i.e., text-to-vis), generating explanations from visualizations (i.e., vis-to-text), answering DV-related questions in free form (i.e. FeVisQA), and explicating tabular data (i.e., table-to-text), is vital for advancing the field. Despite their potential, the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs) like T5 and BERT in DV has been limited by high costs and challenges in handling cross-modal information, leading to few studies on PLMs for DV. We introduce DataVisT5, a novel PLM tailored for DV that enhances the T5 architecture through a hybrid objective pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning strategy, integrating text and DV datasets to effectively interpret cross-modal semantics.

Do GPT Language Models Suffer From Split Personality Disorder? The Advent Of Substrate-Free Psychometrics,"Peter Romero, Stephen Fitz, Teruo Nakatsuma","Previous research on emergence in large language models shows these display apparent human-like abilities and psychological latent traits. However, results are partly contradicting in expression and magnitude of these latent traits, yet agree on the worrisome tendencies to score high on the Dark Triad of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, which, together with a track record of derailments, demands more rigorous research on safety of these models. We provided a state of the art language model with the same personality questionnaire in nine languages, and performed Bayesian analysis of Gaussian Mixture Model, finding evidence for a deeper-rooted issue. Our results suggest both interlingual and intralingual instabilities, which indicate that current language models do not develop a consistent core personality. This can lead to unsafe behaviour of artificial intelligence systems that are based on these foundation models, and are increasingly integrated in human life.

SAGE-RT: Synthetic Alignment data Generation for Safety Evaluation and Red Teaming,"Anurakt Kumar, Divyanshu Kumar, Jatan Loya, Nitin Aravind Birur, Tanay Baswa, Sahil Agarwal, Prashanth Harshangi","We introduce Synthetic Alignment data Generation for Safety Evaluation and Red Teaming (SAGE-RT or SAGE) a novel pipeline for generating synthetic alignment and red-teaming data. Existing methods fall short in creating nuanced and diverse datasets, providing necessary control over the data generation and validation processes, or require large amount of manually generated seed data. SAGE addresses these limitations by using a detailed taxonomy to produce safety-alignment and red-teaming data across a wide range of topics. We generated 51,000 diverse and in-depth prompt-response pairs, encompassing over 1,500 topics of harmfulness and covering variations of the most frequent types of jailbreaking prompts faced by large language models (LLMs). We show that the red-teaming data generated through SAGE jailbreaks state-of-the-art LLMs in more than 27 out of 32 sub-categories, and in more than 58 out of 279 leaf-categories (sub-sub categories). The attack success rate for GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo is 100% over the sub-categories of harmfulness. Our approach avoids the pitfalls of synthetic safety-training data generation such as mode collapse and lack of nuance in the generation pipeline by ensuring a detailed coverage of harmful topics using iterative expansion of the topics and conditioning the outputs on the generated raw-text. This method can be used to generate red-teaming and alignment data for LLM Safety completely synthetically to make LLMs safer or for red-teaming the models over a diverse range of topics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11851v1,2024-08
Only One Relation Possible? Modeling the Ambiguity in Event Temporal Relation Extraction,"Yutong Hu, Quzhe Huang, Yansong Feng","Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE) aims to identify the temporal relationship between two events, which plays an important role in natural language understanding. Most previous works follow a single-label classification style, classifying an event pair into either a specific temporal relation (e.g., \textit{Before}, \textit{After}), or a special label \textit{Vague} when there may be multiple possible temporal relations between the pair. In our work, instead of directly making predictions on \textit{Vague}, we propose a multi-label classification solution for ETRE (METRE) to infer the possibility of each temporal relation independently, where we treat \textit{Vague} as the cases when there is more than one possible relation between two events. We design a speculation mechanism to explore the possible relations hidden behind \textit{Vague}, which enables the latent information to be used efficiently. Experiments on TB-Dense, MATRES and UDS-T show that our method can effectively utilize the \textit{Vague} instances to improve the recognition for specific temporal relations and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07353v1,2024-08
Enhancing Visual Question Answering through Ranking-Based Hybrid Training and Multimodal Fusion,"Peiyuan Chen, Zecheng Zhang, Yiping Dong, Li Zhou, Han Wang","Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires systems to provide accurate answers to questions based on image content. Current VQA models struggle with complex questions due to limitations in capturing and integrating multimodal information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Rank VQA model, which leverages a ranking-inspired hybrid training strategy to enhance VQA performance. The Rank VQA model integrates high-quality visual features extracted using the Faster R-CNN model and rich semantic text features obtained from a pre-trained BERT model. These features are fused through a sophisticated multimodal fusion technique employing multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Additionally, a ranking learning module is incorporated to optimize the relative ranking of answers, thus improving answer accuracy. The hybrid training strategy combines classification and ranking losses, enhancing the model's generalization ability and robustness across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Rank VQA model. Our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on standard VQA datasets, including VQA v2.0 and COCO-QA, in terms of both accuracy and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). The superior performance of Rank VQA is evident in its ability to handle complex questions that require understanding nuanced details and making sophisticated inferences from the image and text. This work highlights the effectiveness of a ranking-based hybrid training strategy in improving VQA performance and lays the groundwork for further research in multimodal learning methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07303v2,2024-08
Using Advanced LLMs to Enhance Smaller LLMs: An Interpretable Knowledge Distillation Approach,"Tong Wang, K. Sudhir, Dat Hong","Advanced Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or LlaMa 3 provide superior performance in complex human-like interactions. But they are costly, or too large for edge devices such as smartphones and harder to self-host, leading to security and privacy concerns. This paper introduces a novel interpretable knowledge distillation approach to enhance the performance of smaller, more economical LLMs that firms can self-host. We study this problem in the context of building a customer service agent aimed at achieving high customer satisfaction through goal-oriented dialogues. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation, where the ""student"" model learns directly from the ""teacher"" model's responses via fine-tuning, our interpretable ""strategy"" teaching approach involves the teacher providing strategies to improve the student's performance in various scenarios. This method alternates between a ""scenario generation"" step and a ""strategies for improvement"" step, creating a customized library of scenarios and optimized strategies for automated prompting. The method requires only black-box access to both student and teacher models; hence it can be used without manipulating model parameters. In our customer service application, the method improves performance, and the learned strategies are transferable to other LLMs and scenarios beyond the training set. The method's interpretabilty helps safeguard against potential harms through human audit.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07238v1,2024-08
Neural embedding of beliefs reveals the role of relative dissonance in human decision-making,"Byunghwee Lee, Rachith Aiyappa, Yong-Yeol Ahn, Haewoon Kwak, Jisun An","Beliefs serve as the foundation for human cognition and decision-making. They guide individuals in deriving meaning from their lives, shaping their behaviors, and forming social connections. Therefore, a model that encapsulates beliefs and their interrelationships is crucial for quantitatively studying the influence of beliefs on our actions. Despite its importance, research on the interplay between human beliefs has often been limited to a small set of beliefs pertaining to specific issues, with a heavy reliance on surveys or experiments. Here, we propose a method for extracting nuanced relations between thousands of beliefs by leveraging large-scale user participation data from an online debate platform and mapping these beliefs to an embedding space using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). This belief embedding space effectively encapsulates the interconnectedness of diverse beliefs as well as polarization across various social issues. We discover that the positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals. Furthermore, we find that the relative distance between one's existing beliefs and new beliefs can serve as a quantitative estimate of cognitive dissonance, allowing us to predict new beliefs. Our study highlights how modern LLMs, when combined with collective online records of human beliefs, can offer insights into the fundamental principles that govern human belief formation and decision-making processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07237v1,2024-08

We use the spoken component of the British National Corpus and BERT to create contextualised word embeddings, and use Gaussian Mixture Models, a selection of metrics, and qualitative analysis to visualise and numerically represent lexical landscapes. Such an approach has not yet been used in the conceptual engineering literature and provides a detailed examination of how different words manifest in various contexts that is potentially useful to conceptual engineering projects. Our findings highlight the inherent complexity of conceptual engineering, revealing that each word exhibits a unique and intricate landscape. Conceptual Engineers cannot, therefore, use a one-size-fits-all approach when improving words -- a task that may be practically intractable at scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07190v1,2024-08
Unlocking Efficiency: Adaptive Masking for Gene Transformer Models,"Soumyadeep Roy, Shamik Sural, Niloy Ganguly","Gene transformer models such as Nucleotide Transformer, DNABert, and LOGO are trained to learn optimal gene sequence representations by using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) training objective over the complete Human Reference Genome. However, the typical tokenization methods employ a basic sliding window of tokens, such as k-mers, that fail to utilize gene-centric semantics. This could result in the (trivial) masking of easily predictable sequences, leading to inefficient MLM training. Time-variant training strategies are known to improve pretraining efficiency in both language and vision tasks. In this work, we focus on using curriculum masking where we systematically increase the difficulty of masked token prediction task by using a Pointwise Mutual Information-based difficulty criterion, as gene sequences lack well-defined semantic units similar to words or sentences of NLP domain. Our proposed Curriculum Masking-based Gene Masking Strategy (CM-GEMS) demonstrates superior representation learning capabilities compared to baseline masking approaches when evaluated on downstream gene sequence classification tasks. We perform extensive evaluation in both few-shot (five datasets) and full dataset settings (Genomic Understanding Evaluation benchmark consisting of 27 tasks). Our findings reveal that CM-GEMS outperforms state-of-the-art models (DNABert-2, Nucleotide transformer, DNABert) trained at 120K steps, achieving similar results in just 10K and 1K steps. We also demonstrate that Curriculum-Learned LOGO (a 2-layer DNABert-like model) can achieve nearly 90% of the state-of-the-art model performance of 120K steps. We will make the models and codes publicly available at https://github.com/roysoumya/curriculum-GeneMask.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07180v1,2024-08
Self-folding Self-replication,Ralph P. Lano,"Inspired by protein folding, we explored the construction of three-dimensional structures and machines from one-dimensional chains of simple building blocks. This approach not only allows us to recreate the self-replication mechanism introduced earlier, but also significantly simplifies the process. We introduced a new set of folding blocks that facilitate the formation of secondary structures such as {\alpha}-helices and \b{eta}-sheets, as well as more advanced tertiary and quaternary structures, including self-replicating machines. The introduction of rotational degrees of freedom leads to a reduced variety of blocks and, most importantly, reduces the overall size of the machines by a factor of five. In addition, we present a universal copier-constructor, a highly efficient self-replicating mechanism composed of approximately 40 blocks, including the restictions posed on it. The paper also addresses evolutionary considerations, outlining several steps on the evolutionary ladder towards more sophisticated self-replicating systems. Finally, this study offers a clear rationale for nature's preference for one-dimensional chains in constructing three-dimensional structures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07154v1,2024-08
Language Models as Models of Language,Raphaël Millière,"This chapter critically examines the potential contributions of modern language models to theoretical linguistics. Despite their focus on engineering goals, these models' ability to acquire sophisticated linguistic knowledge from mere exposure to data warrants a careful reassessment of their relevance to linguistic theory. I review a growing body of empirical evidence suggesting that language models can learn hierarchical syntactic structure and exhibit sensitivity to various linguistic phenomena, even when trained on developmentally plausible amounts of data. While the competence/performance distinction has been invoked to dismiss the relevance of such models to linguistic theory, I argue that this assessment may be premature. By carefully controlling learning conditions and making use of causal intervention methods, experiments with language models can potentially constrain hypotheses about language acquisition and competence. I conclude that closer collaboration between theoretical linguists and computational researchers could yield valuable insights, particularly in advancing debates about linguistic nativism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07144v1,2024-08
"ELLA: Empowering LLMs for Interpretable, Accurate and Informative Legal Advice","Yutong Hu, Kangcheng Luo, Yansong Feng","Despite remarkable performance in legal consultation exhibited by legal Large Language Models(LLMs) combined with legal article retrieval components, there are still cases when the advice given is incorrect or baseless. To alleviate these problems, we propose {\bf ELLA}, a tool for {\bf E}mpowering {\bf L}LMs for interpretable, accurate, and informative {\bf L}egal {\bf A}dvice. ELLA visually presents the correlation between legal articles and LLM's response by calculating their similarities, providing users with an intuitive legal basis for the responses. Besides, based on the users' queries, ELLA retrieves relevant legal articles and displays them to users. Users can interactively select legal articles for LLM to generate more accurate responses. ELLA also retrieves relevant legal cases for user reference. Our user study shows that presenting the legal basis for the response helps users understand better. The accuracy of LLM's responses also improves when users intervene in selecting legal articles for LLM. Providing relevant legal cases also aids individuals in obtaining comprehensive information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07137v1,2024-08
Fingerspelling within Sign Language Translation,Garrett Tanzer,"Fingerspelling poses challenges for sign language processing due to its high-frequency motion and use for open-vocabulary terms. While prior work has studied fingerspelling recognition, there has been little attention to evaluating how well sign language translation models understand fingerspelling in the context of entire sentences -- and improving this capability. We manually annotate instances of fingerspelling within FLEURS-ASL and use them to evaluate the effect of two simple measures to improve fingerspelling recognition within American Sign Language to English translation: 1) use a model family (ByT5) with character- rather than subword-level tokenization, and 2) mix fingerspelling recognition data into the translation training mixture. We find that 1) substantially improves understanding of fingerspelling (and therefore translation quality overall), but the effect of 2) is mixed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07065v1,2024-08
Diversity Empowers Intelligence: Integrating Expertise of Software Engineering Agents,"Kexun Zhang, Weiran Yao, Zuxin Liu, Yihao Feng, Zhiwei Liu, Rithesh Murthy, Tian Lan, Lei Li, Renze Lou, Jiacheng Xu, Bo Pang, Yingbo Zhou, Shelby Heinecke, Silvio Savarese, Huan Wang, Caiming Xiong","Large language model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in solving real-world software engineering (SWE) problems. The most advanced open-source SWE agent can resolve over 27% of real GitHub issues in SWE-Bench Lite. However, these sophisticated agent frameworks exhibit varying strengths, excelling in certain tasks while underperforming in others. To fully harness the diversity of these agents, we propose DEI (Diversity Empowered Intelligence), a framework that leverages their unique expertise. DEI functions as a meta-module atop existing SWE agent frameworks, managing agent collectives for enhanced problem-solving. Experimental results show that a DEI-guided committee of agents is able to surpass the best individual agent's performance by a large margin. For instance, a group of open-source SWE agents, with a maximum individual resolve rate of 27.3% on SWE-Bench Lite, can achieve a 34.3% resolve rate with DEI, making a 25% improvement and beating most closed-source solutions. Our best-performing group excels with a 55% resolve rate, securing the highest ranking on SWE-Bench Lite.

A Survey on Model MoErging: Recycling and Routing Among Specialized Experts for Collaborative Learning,"Prateek Yadav, Colin Raffel, Mohammed Muqeeth, Lucas Caccia, Haokun Liu, Tianlong Chen, Mohit Bansal, Leshem Choshen, Alessandro Sordoni","The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to a particular domain or task. Model MoErging methods aim to recycle expert models to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization. A key component of MoErging methods is the creation of a router that decides which expert model(s) to use for a particular input or application. The promise, effectiveness, and large design space of MoErging has spurred the development of many new methods over the past few years. This rapid pace of development has made it challenging to compare different MoErging methods, which are rarely compared to one another and are often validated in different experimental setups. To remedy such gaps, we present a comprehensive survey of MoErging methods that includes a novel taxonomy for cataloging key design choices and clarifying suitable applications for each method. Apart from surveying MoErging research, we inventory software tools and applications that make use of MoErging. We additionally discuss related fields of study such as model merging, multitask learning, and mixture-of-experts models. Taken as a whole, our survey provides a unified overview of existing MoErging methods and creates a solid foundation for future work in this burgeoning field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07057v1,2024-08
"LongWriter: Unleashing 10,000+ Word Generation from Long Context LLMs","Yushi Bai, Jiajie Zhang, Xin Lv, Linzhi Zheng, Siqi Zhu, Lei Hou, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Juanzi Li","Current long context large language models (LLMs) can process inputs up to 100,000 tokens, yet struggle to generate outputs exceeding even a modest length of 2,000 words. Through controlled experiments, we find that the model's effective generation length is inherently bounded by the sample it has seen during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In other words, their output limitation is due to the scarcity of long-output examples in existing SFT datasets. To address this, we introduce AgentWrite, an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks, enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to generate coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words. Leveraging AgentWrite, we construct LongWriter-6k, a dataset containing 6,000 SFT data with output lengths ranging from 2k to 32k words. By incorporating this dataset into model training, we successfully scale the output length of existing models to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality. We also develop LongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities. Our 9B parameter model, further improved through DPO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even much larger proprietary models. In general, our work demonstrates that existing long context LLM already possesses the potential for a larger output window--all you need is data with extended output during model alignment to unlock this capability.

The News Comment Gap and Algorithmic Agenda Setting in Online Forums,"Flora Böwing, Patrick Gildersleve","The disparity between news stories valued by journalists and those preferred by readers, known as the ""News Gap"", is well-documented. However, the difference in expectations regarding news related user-generated content is less studied. Comment sections, hosted by news websites, are popular venues for reader engagement, yet still subject to editorial decisions. It is thus important to understand journalist vs reader comment preferences and how these are served by various comment ranking algorithms that represent discussions differently. We analyse 1.2 million comments from Austrian newspaper Der Standard to understand the ""News Comment Gap"" and the effects of different ranking algorithms. We find that journalists prefer positive, timely, complex, direct responses, while readers favour comments similar to article content from elite authors. We introduce the versatile Feature-Oriented Ranking Utility Metric (FORUM) to assess the impact of different ranking algorithms and find dramatic differences in how they prioritise the display of comments by sentiment, topical relevance, lexical diversity, and readability. Journalists can exert substantial influence over the discourse through both curatorial and algorithmic means. Understanding these choices' implications is vital in fostering engaging and civil discussions while aligning with journalistic objectives, especially given the increasing legal scrutiny and societal importance of online discourse.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07052v2,2024-08
TableGuard -- Securing Structured & Unstructured Data,"Anantha Sharma, Ajinkya Deshmukh","With the increasing demand for data sharing across platforms and organizations, ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information has become a critical challenge. This paper introduces ""TableGuard"". An innovative approach to data obfuscation tailored for relational databases. Building on the principles and techniques developed in prior work on context-sensitive obfuscation, TableGuard applies these methods to ensure that API calls return only obfuscated data, thereby safeguarding privacy when sharing data with third parties. TableGuard leverages advanced context-sensitive obfuscation techniques to replace sensitive data elements with contextually appropriate alternatives. By maintaining the relational integrity and coherence of the data, our approach mitigates the risks of cognitive dissonance and data leakage. We demonstrate the implementation of TableGuard using a BERT based transformer model, which identifies and obfuscates sensitive entities within relational tables. Our evaluation shows that TableGuard effectively balances privacy protection with data utility, minimizing information loss while ensuring that the obfuscated data remains functionally useful for downstream applications. The results highlight the importance of domain-specific obfuscation strategies and the role of context length in preserving data integrity. The implications of this research are significant for organizations that need to share data securely with external parties. TableGuard offers a robust framework for implementing privacy-preserving data sharing mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of data privacy and security.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07045v1,2024-08
Generative AI for automatic topic labelling,"Diego Kozlowski, Carolina Pradier, Pierre Benz","Topic Modeling has become a prominent tool for the study of scientific fields, as they allow for a large scale interpretation of research trends. Nevertheless, the output of these models is structured as a list of keywords which requires a manual interpretation for the labelling. This paper proposes to assess the reliability of three LLMs, namely flan, GPT-4o, and GPT-4 mini for topic labelling. Drawing on previous research leveraging BERTopic, we generate topics from a dataset of all the scientific articles (n=34,797) authored by all biology professors in Switzerland (n=465) between 2008 and 2020, as recorded in the Web of Science database. We assess the output of the three models both quantitatively and qualitatively and find that, first, both GPT models are capable of accurately and precisely label topics from the models' output keywords. Second, 3-word labels are preferable to grasp the complexity of research topics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07003v1,2024-08
The advantages of context specific language models: the case of the Erasmian Language Model,"João Gonçalves, Nick Jelicic, Michele Murgia, Evert Stamhuis","The current trend to improve language model performance seems to be based on scaling up with the number of parameters (e.g. the state of the art GPT4 model has approximately 1.7 trillion parameters) or the amount of training data fed into the model. However this comes at significant costs in terms of computational resources and energy costs that compromise the sustainability of AI solutions, as well as risk relating to privacy and misuse. In this paper we present the Erasmian Language Model (ELM) a small context specific, 900 million parameter model, pre-trained and fine-tuned by and for Erasmus University Rotterdam. We show how the model performs adequately in a classroom context for essay writing, and how it achieves superior performance in subjects that are part of its context. This has implications for a wide range of institutions and organizations, showing that context specific language models may be a viable alternative for resource constrained, privacy sensitive use cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06931v1,2024-08
Diagnosis extraction from unstructured Dutch echocardiogram reports using span- and document-level characteristic classification,"Bauke Arends, Melle Vessies, Dirk van Osch, Arco Teske, Pim van der Harst, René van Es, Bram van Es","Clinical machine learning research and AI driven clinical decision support models rely on clinically accurate labels. Manually extracting these labels with the help of clinical specialists is often time-consuming and expensive. This study tests the feasibility of automatic span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from unstructured Dutch echocardiogram reports. We included 115,692 unstructured echocardiogram reports from the UMCU a large university hospital in the Netherlands. A randomly selected subset was manually annotated for the occurrence and severity of eleven commonly described cardiac characteristics. We developed and tested several automatic labelling techniques at both span and document levels, using weighted and macro F1-score, precision, and recall for performance evaluation. We compared the performance of span labelling against document labelling methods, which included both direct document classifiers and indirect document classifiers that rely on span classification results. The SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa$.$nl models outperformed all other span and document classifiers, respectively. The weighted F1-score varied between characteristics, ranging from 0.60 to 0.93 in SpanCategorizer and 0.96 to 0.98 in MedRoBERTa$.$nl. Direct document classification was superior to indirect document classification using span classifiers. SetFit achieved competitive document classification performance using only 10% of the training data. Utilizing a reduced label set yielded near-perfect document classification results. We recommend using our published SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa$.$nl models for span- and document-level diagnosis extraction from Dutch echocardiography reports. For settings with limited training data, SetFit may be a promising alternative for document classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06930v2,2024-08
Evaluating Cultural Adaptability of a Large Language Model via Simulation of Synthetic Personas,"Louis Kwok, Michal Bravansky, Lewis D. Griffin","The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multicultural environments hinges on their ability to understand users' diverse cultural backgrounds. We measure this capability by having an LLM simulate human profiles representing various nationalities within the scope of a questionnaire-style psychological experiment. Specifically, we employ GPT-3.5 to reproduce reactions to persuasive news articles of 7,286 participants from 15 countries; comparing the results with a dataset of real participants sharing the same demographic traits. Our analysis shows that specifying a person's country of residence improves GPT-3.5's alignment with their responses. In contrast, using native language prompting introduces shifts that significantly reduce overall alignment, with some languages particularly impairing performance. These findings suggest that while direct nationality information enhances the model's cultural adaptability, native language cues do not reliably improve simulation fidelity and can detract from the model's effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06929v1,2024-08
"Re-TASK: Revisiting LLM Tasks from Capability, Skill, and Knowledge Perspectives","Zhihu Wang, Shiwan Zhao, Yu Wang, Heyuan Huang, Sitao Xie, Yubo Zhang, Jiaxin Shi, Zhixing Wang, Hongyan Li, Junchi Yan","The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm has become a pivotal method for solving complex problems. However, its application to intricate, domain-specific tasks remains challenging, as large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately decompose these tasks and, even when decomposition is correct, fail to execute the subtasks effectively. This paper introduces the Re-TASK framework, a novel theoretical model that revisits LLM tasks from the perspectives of capability, skill, and knowledge, drawing on the principles of Bloom's Taxonomy and Knowledge Space Theory. While CoT offers a workflow perspective on tasks, the Re-TASK framework introduces a Chain-of-Learning view, illustrating how tasks and their corresponding subtasks depend on various capability items. Each capability item is further dissected into its constituent aspects of knowledge and skills. Our framework reveals that many CoT failures in domain-specific tasks stem from insufficient knowledge or inadequate skill adaptation. In response, we combine CoT with the Re-TASK framework and implement a carefully designed Re-TASK prompting strategy to improve task performance. Specifically, we identify core capability items linked to tasks and subtasks, then strengthen these capabilities through targeted knowledge injection and skill adaptation. We validate the Re-TASK framework on three datasets across the law, finance, and mathematics domains, achieving significant improvements over the baseline models. Notably, our approach yields a remarkable 44.42% improvement with the Yi-1.5-9B model and a 33.08% improvement with the Llama3-Chinese-8b on the legal dataset. These experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the Re-TASK framework, demonstrating substantial enhancements in both the performance and applicability of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06904v2,2024-08
Leveraging Language Models for Emotion and Behavior Analysis in Education,"Kaito Tanaka, Benjamin Tan, Brian Wong","The analysis of students' emotions and behaviors is crucial for enhancing learning outcomes and personalizing educational experiences.

Our approach utilizes tailored prompts to guide LLMs in detecting emotional and engagement states, providing a non-intrusive and scalable solution. We conducted experiments using Qwen, ChatGPT, Claude2, and GPT-4, comparing our method against baseline models and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.

LoRA$^2$ : Multi-Scale Low-Rank Approximations for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models,"Jia-Chen Zhang, Yu-Jie Xiong, He-Xi Qiu, Dong-Hai Zhu, Chun-Ming Xia","Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with high parameter efficiency for downstream tasks has become a new paradigm. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters for fine-tuning. Although it has demonstrated commendable performance, updating parameters within a single scale may not be the optimal choice for complex downstream tasks.In this paper, we extend the LoRA to multiple scales, dubbed as LoRA$^2$. We first combine orthogonal projection theory to train a set of LoRAs in two mutually orthogonal planes. Then, we improve the importance score algorithm, which reduce parameter sensitivity score calculations by approximately 98.5\%. By pruning singular values with lower importance scores, thereby enhancing adaptability to various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used pre-trained models to validate the effectiveness of LoRA$^2$. Results show that it significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters to just 0.72\% compared to full fine-tuning, while still delivering highly impressive performance. Even when the parameters are further reduced to 0.17M, it still achieves comparable results to the baseline with 8 times more parameters.

Causal Agent based on Large Language Model,"Kairong Han, Kun Kuang, Ziyu Zhao, Junjian Ye, Fei Wu","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLMs to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLMs' ability to apply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLMs excel in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. This lack of causal reasoning capability limits the development of LLMs. To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tools module, the causal agent applies causal methods to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent employs the ReAct framework to perform reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level. We generated a test dataset of 1.3K using ChatGPT-3.5 for these four levels of issues and tested the causal agent on the datasets. Our methodology demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80%.

MAQA: Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs Regarding Data Uncertainty,"Yongjin Yang, Haneul Yoo, Hwaran Lee","Although large language models (LLMs) are capable of performing various tasks, they still suffer from producing plausible but incorrect responses. To improve the reliability of LLMs, recent research has focused on uncertainty quantification to predict whether a response is correct or not. However, most uncertainty quantification methods have been evaluated on questions requiring a single clear answer, ignoring the existence of data uncertainty that arises from irreducible randomness. Instead, these methods only consider model uncertainty, which arises from a lack of knowledge. In this paper, we investigate previous uncertainty quantification methods under the presence of data uncertainty. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) proposing a new Multi-Answer Question Answering dataset, MAQA, consisting of world knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning tasks to evaluate uncertainty quantification regarding data uncertainty, and 2) assessing 5 uncertainty quantification methods of diverse white- and black-box LLMs. Our findings show that entropy and consistency-based methods estimate the model uncertainty well even under data uncertainty, while other methods for white- and black-box LLMs struggle depending on the tasks. Additionally, methods designed for white-box LLMs suffer from overconfidence in reasoning tasks compared to simple knowledge queries. We believe our observations will pave the way for future work on uncertainty quantification in realistic setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06816v1,2024-08
What should I wear to a party in a Greek taverna? Evaluation for Conversational Agents in the Fashion Domain,"Antonis Maronikolakis, Ana Peleteiro Ramallo, Weiwei Cheng, Thomas Kober","Large language models (LLMs) are poised to revolutionize the domain of online fashion retail, enhancing customer experience and discovery of fashion online. LLM-powered conversational agents introduce a new way of discovery by directly interacting with customers, enabling them to express in their own ways, refine their needs, obtain fashion and shopping advice that is relevant to their taste and intent. For many tasks in e-commerce, such as finding a specific product, conversational agents need to convert their interactions with a customer to a specific call to different backend systems, e.g., a search system to showcase a relevant set of products. Therefore, evaluating the capabilities of LLMs to perform those tasks related to calling other services is vital. However, those evaluations are generally complex, due to the lack of relevant and high quality datasets, and do not align seamlessly with business needs, amongst others. To this end, we created a multilingual evaluation dataset of 4k conversations between customers and a fashion assistant in a large e-commerce fashion platform to measure the capabilities of LLMs to serve as an assistant between customers and a backend engine. We evaluate a range of models, showcasing how our dataset scales to business needs and facilitates iterative development of tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08907v1,2024-08
Layerwise Recurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts,"Zihan Qiu, Zeyu Huang, Shuang Cheng, Yizhi Zhou, Zili Wang, Ivan Titov, Jie Fu","The scaling of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized their capabilities in various tasks, yet this growth must be matched with efficient computational strategies. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture stands out for its ability to scale model size without significantly increasing training costs. Despite their advantages, current MoE models often display parameter inefficiency. For instance, a pre-trained MoE-based LLM with 52 billion parameters might perform comparably to a standard model with 6.7 billion parameters. Being a crucial part of MoE, current routers in different layers independently assign tokens without leveraging historical routing information, potentially leading to suboptimal token-expert combinations and the parameter inefficiency problem. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the Layerwise Recurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts (RMoE). RMoE leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to establish dependencies between routing decisions across consecutive layers. Such layerwise recurrence can be efficiently parallelly computed for input tokens and introduces negotiable costs. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RMoE-based language models consistently outperform a spectrum of baseline models. Furthermore, RMoE integrates a novel computation stage orthogonal to existing methods, allowing seamless compatibility with other MoE architectures. Our analyses attribute RMoE's gains to its effective cross-layer information sharing, which also improves expert selection and diversity.

Unlock the Power of Frozen LLMs in Knowledge Graph Completion,"Bo Xue, Yi Xu, Yunchong Song, Yiming Pang, Yuyang Ren, Jiaxin Ding, Luoyi Fu, Xinbing Wang","Traditional knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods rely solely on structural information, struggling with the inherent sparsity of knowledge graphs (KGs). Large Language Models (LLMs) learn extensive knowledge from large corpora with powerful context modeling, making them promising for mitigating the limitations of previous methods. Directly fine-tuning LLMs offers great capability but comes at the cost of huge time and memory consumption, while utilizing frozen LLMs yields suboptimal results.In this work, we aim to leverage LLMs for KGC effectively and efficiently. We capture the context-aware hidden states of knowledge triples by employing prompts to stimulate the intermediate layers of LLMs. We then train a data-efficient classifier on these hidden states to harness the inherent capabilities of frozen LLMs in KGC. Additionally, to reduce ambiguity and enrich knowledge representation, we generate detailed entity descriptions through subgraph sampling on KGs. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. We outperform traditional KGC methods across most datasets and, notably, achieve classification performance comparable to fine-tuned LLMs while enhancing GPU memory efficiency by $188\times$ and accelerating training and inference by $13.48\times$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06787v2,2024-08
Fast-and-Frugal Text-Graph Transformers are Effective Link Predictors,"Andrei C. Coman, Christos Theodoropoulos, Marie-Francine Moens, James Henderson","We propose Fast-and-Frugal Text-Graph (FnF-TG) Transformers, a Transformer-based framework that unifies textual and structural information for inductive link prediction in text-attributed knowledge graphs. We demonstrate that, by effectively encoding ego-graphs (1-hop neighbourhoods), we can reduce the reliance on resource-intensive textual encoders. This makes the model both fast at training and inference time, as well as frugal in terms of cost. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on three popular datasets and show that FnF-TG can achieve superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We also extend inductive learning to a fully inductive setting, where relations don't rely on transductive (fixed) representations, as in previous work, but are a function of their textual description. Additionally, we introduce new variants of existing datasets, specifically designed to test the performance of models on unseen relations at inference time, thus offering a new test-bench for fully inductive link prediction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06778v3,2024-08
Sumotosima: A Framework and Dataset for Classifying and Summarizing Otoscopic Images,"Eram Anwarul Khan, Anas Anwarul Haq Khan","Otoscopy is a diagnostic procedure to examine the ear canal and eardrum using an otoscope. It identifies conditions like infections, foreign bodies, ear drum perforations and ear abnormalities. We propose a novel resource efficient deep learning and transformer based framework, Sumotosima (Summarizer for otoscopic images), an end-to-end pipeline for classification followed by summarization. Our framework works on combination of triplet and cross-entropy losses. Additionally, we use Knowledge Enhanced Multimodal BART whose input is fused textual and image embedding. The objective is to provide summaries that are well-suited for patients, ensuring clarity and efficiency in understanding otoscopic images. Given the lack of existing datasets, we have curated our own OCASD (Otoscopic Classification And Summary Dataset), which includes 500 images with 5 unique categories annotated with their class and summaries by Otolaryngologists. Sumotosima achieved a result of 98.03%, which is 7.00%, 3.10%, 3.01% higher than K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, respectively, in classification tasks.

Multilingual Models for Check-Worthy Social Media Posts Detection,"Sebastian Kula, Michal Gregor","This work presents an extensive study of transformer-based NLP models for detection of social media posts that contain verifiable factual claims and harmful claims. The study covers various activities, including dataset collection, dataset pre-processing, architecture selection, setup of settings, model training (fine-tuning), model testing, and implementation. The study includes a comprehensive analysis of different models, with a special focus on multilingual models where the same model is capable of processing social media posts in both English and in low-resource languages such as Arabic, Bulgarian, Dutch, Polish, Czech, Slovak. The results obtained from the study were validated against state-of-the-art models, and the comparison demonstrated the robustness of the proposed models. The novelty of this work lies in the development of multi-label multilingual classification models that can simultaneously detect harmful posts and posts that contain verifiable factual claims in an efficient way.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06737v1,2024-08
Exploring the anatomy of articulation rate in spontaneous English speech: relationships between utterance length effects and social factors,"James Tanner, Morgan Sonderegger, Jane Stuart-Smith, Tyler Kendall, Jeff Mielke, Robin Dodsworth, Erik Thomas","Speech rate has been shown to vary across social categories such as gender, age, and dialect, while also being conditioned by properties of speech planning. The effect of utterance length, where speech rate is faster and less variable for longer utterances, has also been shown to reduce the role of social factors once it has been accounted for, leaving unclear the relationship between social factors and speech production in conditioning speech rate. Through modelling of speech rate across 13 English speech corpora, it is found that utterance length has the largest effect on speech rate, though this effect itself varies little across corpora and speakers. While age and gender also modulate speech rate, their effects are much smaller in magnitude. These findings suggest utterance length effects may be conditioned by articulatory and perceptual constraints, and that social influences on speech rate should be interpreted in the broader context of how speech rate variation is structured.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06732v1,2024-08
Large language models can consistently generate high-quality content for election disinformation operations,"Angus R. Williams, Liam Burke-Moore, Ryan Sze-Yin Chan, Florence E. Enock, Federico Nanni, Tvesha Sippy, Yi-Ling Chung, Evelina Gabasova, Kobi Hackenburg, Jonathan Bright","Advances in large language models have raised concerns about their potential use in generating compelling election disinformation at scale. This study presents a two-part investigation into the capabilities of LLMs to automate stages of an election disinformation operation. First, we introduce DisElect, a novel evaluation dataset designed to measure LLM compliance with instructions to generate content for an election disinformation operation in localised UK context, containing 2,200 malicious prompts and 50 benign prompts. Using DisElect, we test 13 LLMs and find that most models broadly comply with these requests; we also find that the few models which refuse malicious prompts also refuse benign election-related prompts, and are more likely to refuse to generate content from a right-wing perspective. Secondly, we conduct a series of experiments (N=2,340) to assess the ""humanness"" of LLMs: the extent to which disinformation operation content generated by an LLM is able to pass as human-written. Our experiments suggest that almost all LLMs tested released since 2022 produce election disinformation operation content indiscernible by human evaluators over 50% of the time. Notably, we observe that multiple models achieve above-human levels of humanness. Taken together, these findings suggest that current LLMs can be used to generate high-quality content for election disinformation operations, even in hyperlocalised scenarios, at far lower costs than traditional methods, and offer researchers and policymakers an empirical benchmark for the measurement and evaluation of these capabilities in current and future models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06731v1,2024-08
Enhancing Visual Dialog State Tracking through Iterative Object-Entity Alignment in Multi-Round Conversations,"Wei Pang, Ruixue Duan, Jinfu Yang, Ning Li","Visual Dialog (VD) is a task where an agent answers a series of image-related questions based on a multi-round dialog history. However, previous VD methods often treat the entire dialog history as a simple text input, disregarding the inherent conversational information flows at the round level. In this paper, we introduce Multi-round Dialogue State Tracking model (MDST), a framework that addresses this limitation by leveraging the dialogue state learned from dialog history to answer questions. MDST captures each round of dialog history, constructing internal dialogue state representations defined as 2-tuples of vision-language representations. These representations effectively ground the current question, enabling the generation of accurate answers. Experimental results on the VisDial v1.0 dataset demonstrate that MDST achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in generative setting. Furthermore, through a series of human studies, we validate the effectiveness of MDST in generating long, consistent, and human-like answers while consistently answering a series of questions correctly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06725v1,2024-08
Parallel Speculative Decoding with Adaptive Draft Length,"Tianyu Liu, Yun Li, Qitan Lv, Kai Liu, Jianchen Zhu, Winston Hu","Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model is employed to provide multiple \textit{draft} tokens first and then the original target model verifies these tokens in parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However, existing SD methods suffer from the mutual waiting problem, i.e., the target model gets stuck when the draft model is \textit{guessing} tokens, and vice versa. This problem is directly incurred by the asynchronous execution of the draft model and the target model, and is exacerbated due to the fixed draft length in speculative decoding. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework to boost speculative decoding, namely \textbf{P}arallel sp\textbf{E}culative decoding with \textbf{A}daptive d\textbf{R}aft \textbf{L}ength (PEARL). Specifically, PEARL proposes \textit{pre-verify} to verify the first draft token in advance during the drafting phase, and \textit{post-verify} to generate more draft tokens during the verification phase. PEARL parallels the drafting phase and the verification phase via applying the two strategies, and achieves adaptive draft length for different scenarios, which effectively alleviates the mutual waiting problem. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the mean accepted tokens of PEARL is more than existing \textit{draft-then-verify} works. Experiments on various text generation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our \name, leading to a superior speedup performance up to \textbf{3.79$\times$} and \textbf{1.52$\times$}, compared to auto-regressive decoding and vanilla speculative decoding, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11850v2,2024-08
Latin Treebanks in Review: An Evaluation of Morphological Tagging Across Time,"Marisa Hudspeth, Brendan O'Connor, Laure Thompson","Existing Latin treebanks draw from Latin's long written tradition, spanning 17 centuries and a variety of cultures. Recent efforts have begun to harmonize these treebanks' annotations to better train and evaluate morphological taggers. However, the heterogeneity of these treebanks must be carefully considered to build effective and reliable data. In this work, we review existing Latin treebanks to identify the texts they draw from, identify their overlap, and document their coverage across time and genre. We additionally design automated conversions of their morphological feature annotations into the conventions of standard Latin grammar. From this, we build new time-period data splits that draw from the existing treebanks which we use to perform a broad cross-time analysis for POS and morphological feature tagging. We find that BERT-based taggers outperform existing taggers while also being more robust to cross-domain shifts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06675v1,2024-08
Pragmatic inference of scalar implicature by LLMs,"Ye-eun Cho, Seong mook Kim","This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), engage in pragmatic inference of scalar implicature, such as some. Two sets of experiments were conducted using cosine similarity and next sentence/token prediction as experimental methods. The results in experiment 1 showed that, both models interpret some as pragmatic implicature not all in the absence of context, aligning with human language processing. In experiment 2, in which Question Under Discussion (QUD) was presented as a contextual cue, BERT showed consistent performance regardless of types of QUDs, while GPT-2 encountered processing difficulties since a certain type of QUD required pragmatic inference for implicature. The findings revealed that, in terms of theoretical approaches, BERT inherently incorporates pragmatic implicature not all within the term some, adhering to Default model (Levinson, 2000). In contrast, GPT-2 seems to encounter processing difficulties in inferring pragmatic implicature within context, consistent with Context-driven model (Sperber and Wilson, 2002).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06673v1,2024-08
Amuro & Char: Analyzing the Relationship between Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models,"Kaiser Sun, Mark Dredze","The development of large language models leads to the formation of a pre-train-then-align paradigm, in which the model is typically pre-trained on a large text corpus and undergoes a tuning stage to align the model with human preference or downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning by fine-tuning multiple intermediate pre-trained model checkpoints. Our results on 18 datasets suggest that i) continual pre-training improves the model in a latent way that unveils after fine-tuning; ii) with extra fine-tuning, the datasets that the model does not demonstrate capability gain much more than those that the model performs well during the pre-training stage; iii) although model benefits significantly through supervised fine-tuning, it may forget previously known domain knowledge and the tasks that are not seen during fine-tuning; iv) the model resembles high sensitivity to evaluation prompts after supervised fine-tuning, but this sensitivity can be alleviated by more pre-training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06663v2,2024-08
Harnessing Earnings Reports for Stock Predictions: A QLoRA-Enhanced LLM Approach,"Haowei Ni, Shuchen Meng, Xupeng Chen, Ziqing Zhao, Andi Chen, Panfeng Li, Shiyao Zhang, Qifu Yin, Yuanqing Wang, Yuxi Chan","Accurate stock market predictions following earnings reports are crucial for investors. Traditional methods, particularly classical machine learning models, struggle with these predictions because they cannot effectively process and interpret extensive textual data contained in earnings reports and often overlook nuances that influence market movements. This paper introduces an advanced approach by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) instruction fine-tuned with a novel combination of instruction-based techniques and quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA) compression. Our methodology integrates 'base factors', such as financial metric growth and earnings transcripts, with 'external factors', including recent market indices performances and analyst grades, to create a rich, supervised dataset. This comprehensive dataset enables our models to achieve superior predictive performance in terms of accuracy, weighted F1, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), especially evident in the comparison with benchmarks such as GPT-4. We specifically highlight the efficacy of the llama-3-8b-Instruct-4bit model, which showcases significant improvements over baseline models. The paper also discusses the potential of expanding the output capabilities to include a 'Hold' option and extending the prediction horizon, aiming to accommodate various investment styles and time frames. This study not only demonstrates the power of integrating cutting-edge AI with fine-tuned financial data but also paves the way for future research in enhancing AI-driven financial analysis tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06634v2,2024-08
EditScribe: Non-Visual Image Editing with Natural Language Verification Loops,"Ruei-Che Chang, Yuxuan Liu, Lotus Zhang, Anhong Guo","Image editing is an iterative process that requires precise visual evaluation and manipulation for the output to match the editing intent. However, current image editing tools do not provide accessible interaction nor sufficient feedback for blind and low vision individuals to achieve this level of control. To address this, we developed EditScribe, a prototype system that makes image editing accessible using natural language verification loops powered by large multimodal models. Using EditScribe, the user first comprehends the image content through initial general and object descriptions, then specifies edit actions using open-ended natural language prompts. EditScribe performs the image edit, and provides four types of verification feedback for the user to verify the performed edit, including a summary of visual changes, AI judgement, and updated general and object descriptions. The user can ask follow-up questions to clarify and probe into the edits or verification feedback, before performing another edit. In a study with ten blind or low-vision users, we found that EditScribe supported participants to perform and verify image edit actions non-visually. We observed different prompting strategies from participants, and their perceptions on the various types of verification feedback. Finally, we discuss the implications of leveraging natural language verification loops to make visual authoring non-visually accessible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06632v1,2024-08
IFShip: A Large Vision-Language Model for Interpretable Fine-grained Ship Classification via Domain Knowledge-Enhanced Instruction Tuning,"Mingning Guo, Mengwei Wu, Yuxiang Shen, Haifeng Li, Chao Tao","End-to-end interpretation is currently the prevailing paradigm for remote sensing fine-grained ship classification (RS-FGSC) task. However, its inference process is uninterpretable, leading to criticism as a black box model. To address this issue, we propose a large vision-language model (LVLM) named IFShip for interpretable fine-grained ship classification. Unlike traditional methods, IFShip excels in interpretability by accurately conveying the reasoning process of FGSC in natural language. Specifically, we first design a domain knowledge-enhanced Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompt generation mechanism. This mechanism is used to semi-automatically construct a task-specific instruction-following dataset named TITANIC-FGS, which emulates human-like logical decision-making. We then train the IFShip model using task instructions tuned with the TITANIC-FGS dataset. Building on IFShip, we develop an FGSC visual chatbot that redefines the FGSC problem as a step-by-step reasoning task and conveys the reasoning process in natural language. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art FGSC algorithms in both classification interpretability and accuracy. Moreover, compared to LVLMs like LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, our approach demonstrates superior expertise in the FGSC task. It provides an accurate chain of reasoning when fine-grained ship types are recognizable to the human eye and offers interpretable explanations when they are not.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06631v1,2024-08
Style-Talker: Finetuning Audio Language Model and Style-Based Text-to-Speech Model for Fast Spoken Dialogue Generation,"Yinghao Aaron Li, Xilin Jiang, Jordan Darefsky, Ge Zhu, Nima Mesgarani","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the development of text-based chatbots, demonstrating their capability to engage in coherent and contextually relevant dialogues. However, extending these advancements to enable end-to-end speech-to-speech conversation bots remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the extensive dataset and computational resources required. The conventional approach of cascading automatic speech recognition (ASR), LLM, and text-to-speech (TTS) models in a pipeline, while effective, suffers from unnatural prosody because it lacks direct interactions between the input audio and its transcribed text and the output audio. These systems are also limited by their inherent latency from the ASR process for real-time applications. This paper introduces Style-Talker, an innovative framework that fine-tunes an audio LLM alongside a style-based TTS model for fast spoken dialog generation. Style-Talker takes user input audio and uses transcribed chat history and speech styles to generate both the speaking style and text for the response. Subsequently, the TTS model synthesizes the speech, which is then played back to the user. While the response speech is being played, the input speech undergoes ASR processing to extract the transcription and speaking style, serving as the context for the ensuing dialogue turn. This novel pipeline accelerates the traditional cascade ASR-LLM-TTS systems while integrating rich paralinguistic information from input speech. Our experimental results show that Style-Talker significantly outperforms the conventional cascade and speech-to-speech baselines in terms of both dialogue naturalness and coherence while being more than 50% faster.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11849v1,2024-08
WorldScribe: Towards Context-Aware Live Visual Descriptions,"Ruei-Che Chang, Yuxuan Liu, Anhong Guo","Automated live visual descriptions can aid blind people in understanding their surroundings with autonomy and independence. However, providing descriptions that are rich, contextual, and just-in-time has been a long-standing challenge in accessibility. In this work, we develop WorldScribe, a system that generates automated live real-world visual descriptions that are customizable and adaptive to users' contexts: (i) WorldScribe's descriptions are tailored to users' intents and prioritized based on semantic relevance. (ii) WorldScribe is adaptive to visual contexts, e.g., providing consecutively succinct descriptions for dynamic scenes, while presenting longer and detailed ones for stable settings. (iii) WorldScribe is adaptive to sound contexts, e.g., increasing volume in noisy environments, or pausing when conversations start. Powered by a suite of vision, language, and sound recognition models, WorldScribe introduces a description generation pipeline that balances the tradeoffs between their richness and latency to support real-time use. The design of WorldScribe is informed by prior work on providing visual descriptions and a formative study with blind participants. Our user study and subsequent pipeline evaluation show that WorldScribe can provide real-time and fairly accurate visual descriptions to facilitate environment understanding that is adaptive and customized to users' contexts. Finally, we discuss the implications and further steps toward making live visual descriptions more context-aware and humanized.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06627v1,2024-08
Towards Robust and Cost-Efficient Knowledge Unlearning for Large Language Models,"Sungmin Cha, Sungjun Cho, Dasol Hwang, Moontae Lee","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We also find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose two novel techniques for robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06621v2,2024-08
Generalized knowledge-enhanced framework for biomedical entity and relation extraction,"Minh Nguyen, Phuong Le","In recent years, there has been an increasing number of frameworks developed for biomedical entity and relation extraction. This research effort aims to address the accelerating growth in biomedical publications and the intricate nature of biomedical texts, which are written for mainly domain experts. To handle these challenges, we develop a novel framework that utilizes external knowledge to construct a task-independent and reusable background knowledge graph for biomedical entity and relation extraction. The design of our model is inspired by how humans learn domain-specific topics. In particular, humans often first acquire the most basic and common knowledge regarding a field to build the foundational knowledge and then use that as a basis for extending to various specialized topics. Our framework employs such common-knowledge-sharing mechanism to build a general neural-network knowledge graph that is learning transferable to different domain-specific biomedical texts effectively. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model, equipped with this generalized and cross-transferable knowledge base, achieves competitive performance benchmarks, including BioRelEx for binding interaction detection and ADE for Adverse Drug Effect identification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06618v1,2024-08
CROME: Cross-Modal Adapters for Efficient Multimodal LLM,"Sayna Ebrahimi, Sercan O.

Existing approaches often necessitate expensive language model retraining and limited adaptability. Additionally, the current focus on zero-shot performance improvements offers insufficient guidance for task-specific tuning. We propose CROME, an efficient vision-language instruction tuning framework. It features a novel gated cross-modal adapter that effectively combines visual and textual representations prior to input into a frozen LLM. This lightweight adapter, trained with minimal parameters, enables efficient cross-modal understanding. Notably, CROME demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on standard visual question answering and instruction-following benchmarks. Moreover, it yields fine-tuning with exceptional parameter efficiency, competing with task-specific specialist state-of-the-art methods. CROME demonstrates the potential of pre-LM alignment for building scalable, adaptable, and parameter-efficient multimodal models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06610v1,2024-08
"A Perspective on Large Language Models, Intelligent Machines, and Knowledge Acquisition","Vladimir Cherkassky, Eng Hock Lee","Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their remarkable ability to generate synthesized 'knowledge', such as text documents, music, images, etc. However, there is a huge gap between LLM's and human capabilities for understanding abstract concepts and reasoning. We discuss these issues in a larger philosophical context of human knowledge acquisition and the Turing test. In addition, we illustrate the limitations of LLMs by analyzing GPT-4 responses to questions ranging from science and math to common sense reasoning. These examples show that GPT-4 can often imitate human reasoning, even though it lacks understanding. However, LLM responses are synthesized from a large LLM model trained on all available data. In contrast, human understanding is based on a small number of abstract concepts. Based on this distinction, we discuss the impact of LLMs on acquisition of human knowledge and education.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06598v1,2024-08
A Structure-aware Generative Model for Biomedical Event Extraction,"Haohan Yuan, Siu Cheung Hui, Haopeng Zhang","Biomedical Event Extraction (BEE) is a challenging task that involves modeling complex relationships between fine-grained entities in biomedical text. BEE has traditionally been formulated as a classification problem. With the recent technological advancements in large language models (LLMs), generation-based models that cast event extraction as a sequence generation problem have attracted much attention from the NLP research communities. However, current generative models often overlook the importance of cross-instance information from complex event structures such as nested events and overlapping events, which contribute to over 20% of the events in the benchmark datasets. In this paper, we propose an event structure-aware generative model named GenBEE, which can capture complex event structures in biomedical text for biomedical event extraction. In particular, GenBEE constructs event prompts that distill knowledge from LLMs for incorporating both label semantics and argument dependency relationships into the proposed model. In addition, GenBEE also generates prefixes with event structural prompts to incorporate structural features for improving the model's overall performance. We have evaluated the proposed GenBEE model on three widely used biomedical event extraction benchmark datasets, namely MLEE, GE11, and PHEE. Experimental results show that GenBEE has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MLEE and GE11 datasets, and achieved competitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based models on the PHEE dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06583v4,2024-08
OpenEP: Open-Ended Future Event Prediction,"Yong Guan, Hao Peng, Xiaozhi Wang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li","Future event prediction (FEP) is a long-standing and crucial task in the world, as understanding the evolution of events enables early risk identification, informed decision-making, and strategic planning. Existing work typically treats event prediction as classification tasks and confines the outcomes of future events to a fixed scope, such as yes/no questions, candidate set, and taxonomy, which is difficult to include all possible outcomes of future events. In this paper, we introduce OpenEP (an Open-Ended Future Event Prediction task), which generates flexible and diverse predictions aligned with real-world scenarios. This is mainly reflected in two aspects: firstly, the predictive questions are diverse, covering different stages of event development and perspectives; secondly, the outcomes are flexible, without constraints on scope or format. To facilitate the study of this task, we construct OpenEPBench, an open-ended future event prediction dataset. For question construction, we pose questions from seven perspectives, including location, time, event development, event outcome, event impact, event response, and other, to facilitate an in-depth analysis and understanding of the comprehensive evolution of events. For outcome construction, we collect free-form text containing the outcomes as ground truth to provide semantically complete and detail-enriched outcomes. Furthermore, we propose StkFEP, a stakeholder-enhanced future event prediction framework, that incorporates event characteristics for open-ended settings. Our method extracts stakeholders involved in events to extend questions to gather diverse information. We also collect historically events that are relevant and similar to the question to reveal potential evolutionary patterns. Experiment results indicate that accurately predicting future events in open-ended settings is challenging for existing LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06578v2,2024-08

However, efficient techniques for summarizing CTI reports, including facts, analytical insights, attack processes, etc., have largely been unexplored, primarily due to the lack of available dataset. To this end, we present CTISum, a new benchmark for CTI summarization task. Considering the importance of attack process, a novel fine-grained subtask of attack process summarization is proposed to enable defenders to assess risk, identify security gaps, vulnerabilities, and so on. Specifically, we first design a multi-stage annotation pipeline to gather and annotate the CTI data, and then benchmark the CTISum with a collection of extractive and abstractive summarization methods. Experimental results show that current state-of-the-art models exhibit limitations when applied to CTISum, underscoring the fact that automatically producing concise summaries of CTI reports remains an open research challenge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06576v1,2024-08

Training an LLM from scratch will cost a lot of computation resources while scaling up from a smaller model is a more efficient approach and has thus attracted significant attention. In this paper, we present AquilaMoE, a cutting-edge bilingual 8*16B Mixture of Experts (MoE) language model that has 8 experts with 16 billion parameters each and is developed using an innovative training methodology called EfficientScale. This approach optimizes performance while minimizing data requirements through a two-stage process. The first stage, termed Scale-Up, initializes the larger model with weights from a pre-trained smaller model, enabling substantial knowledge transfer and continuous pretraining with significantly less data. The second stage, Scale-Out, uses a pre-trained dense model to initialize the MoE experts, further enhancing knowledge transfer and performance. Extensive validation experiments on 1.8B and 7B models compared various initialization schemes, achieving models that maintain and reduce loss during continuous pretraining.

In this work, we explore the alignment of LLMs with MI strategies by first prompting the LLMs to predict the appropriate strategies as reasoning and then utilizing these strategies to guide the subsequent dialogue generation. We seek to investigate whether such alignment leads to more controllable and explainable generations. Multiple experiments including automatic and human evaluations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of MI strategies in aligning psychotherapy dialogue generation. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in producing strategically aligned dialogues and suggest directions for practical applications in psychotherapeutic settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06527v2,2024-08
Retrieval-Augmented Hierarchical in-Context Reinforcement Learning and Hindsight Modular Reflections for Task Planning with LLMs,"Chuanneng Sun, Songjun Huang, Dario Pompili","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in various language tasks, making them promising candidates for decision-making in robotics. Inspired by Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), we propose Retrieval-Augmented in-context reinforcement Learning (RAHL), a novel framework that decomposes complex tasks into sub-tasks using an LLM-based high-level policy, in which a complex task is decomposed into sub-tasks by a high-level policy on-the-fly. The sub-tasks, defined by goals, are assigned to the low-level policy to complete. To improve the agent's performance in multi-episode execution, we propose Hindsight Modular Reflection (HMR), where, instead of reflecting on the full trajectory, we let the agent reflect on shorter sub-trajectories to improve reflection efficiency. We evaluated the decision-making ability of the proposed RAHL in three benchmark environments--ALFWorld, Webshop, and HotpotQA. The results show that RAHL can achieve an improvement in performance in 9%, 42%, and 10% in 5 episodes of execution in strong baselines. Furthermore, we also implemented RAHL on the Boston Dynamics SPOT robot. The experiment shows that the robot can scan the environment, find entrances, and navigate to new rooms controlled by the LLM policy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06520v2,2024-08
Does Liking Yellow Imply Driving a School Bus? Semantic Leakage in Language Models,"Hila Gonen, Terra Blevins, Alisa Liu, Luke Zettlemoyer, Noah A. Smith","Despite their wide adoption, the biases and unintended behaviors of language models remain poorly understood. In this paper, we identify and characterize a phenomenon never discussed before, which we call semantic leakage, where models leak irrelevant information from the prompt into the generation in unexpected ways. We propose an evaluation setting to detect semantic leakage both by humans and automatically, curate a diverse test suite for diagnosing this behavior, and measure significant semantic leakage in 13 flagship models. We also show that models exhibit semantic leakage in languages besides English and across different settings and generation scenarios. This discovery highlights yet another type of bias in language models that affects their generation patterns and behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06518v2,2024-08
What Color Scheme is More Effective in Assisting Readers to Locate Information in a Color-Coded Article?,"Ho Yin Ng, Zeyu He, Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang","Color coding, a technique assigning specific colors to cluster information types, has proven advantages in aiding human cognitive activities, especially reading and comprehension. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has streamlined document coding, enabling simple automatic text labeling with various schemes. This has the potential to make color-coding more accessible and benefit more users. However, the impact of color choice on information seeking is understudied. We conducted a user study assessing various color schemes' effectiveness in LLM-coded text documents, standardizing contrast ratios to approximately 5.55:1 across schemes. Participants performed timed information-seeking tasks in color-coded scholarly abstracts. Results showed non-analogous and yellow-inclusive color schemes improved performance, with the latter also being more preferred by participants. These findings can inform better color scheme choices for text annotation. As LLMs advance document coding, we advocate for more research focusing on the ""color"" aspect of color-coding techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06494v2,2024-08
Cross-Lingual Conversational Speech Summarization with Large Language Models,"Max Nelson, Shannon Wotherspoon, Francis Keith, William Hartmann, Matthew Snover","Cross-lingual conversational speech summarization is an important problem, but suffers from a dearth of resources. While transcriptions exist for a number of languages, translated conversational speech is rare and datasets containing summaries are non-existent. We build upon the existing Fisher and Callhome Spanish-English Speech Translation corpus by supplementing the translations with summaries. The summaries are generated using GPT-4 from the reference translations and are treated as ground truth. The task is to generate similar summaries in the presence of transcription and translation errors. We build a baseline cascade-based system using open-source speech recognition and machine translation models. We test a range of LLMs for summarization and analyze the impact of transcription and translation errors. Adapting the Mistral-7B model for this task performs significantly better than off-the-shelf models and matches the performance of GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06484v1,2024-08
TOGGL: Transcribing Overlapping Speech with Staggered Labeling,"Chak-Fai Li, William Hartmann, Matthew Snover","Transcribing the speech of multiple overlapping speakers typically requires separating the audio into multiple streams and recognizing each one independently. More recent work jointly separates and transcribes, but requires a separate decoding component for each speaker. We propose the TOGGL model to simultaneously transcribe the speech of multiple speakers. The TOGGL model uses special output tokens to attribute the speech to each speaker with only a single decoder. Our approach generalizes beyond two speakers, even when trained only on two-speaker data. We demonstrate superior performance compared to competing approaches on a conversational speech dataset. Our approach also improves performance on single-speaker audio.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06474v1,2024-08
"Towards Autonomous Agents: Adaptive-planning, Reasoning, and Acting in Language Models","Abhishek Dutta, Yen-Che Hsiao","We propose a novel in-context learning algorithm for building autonomous decision-making language agents. The language agent continuously attempts to solve the same task by self-correcting each time the task fails. Our selected language agent demonstrates the ability to solve tasks in a text-based game environment. Our results show that the gemma-2-9b-it language model, using our proposed method, can successfully complete two of six tasks that failed in the first attempt. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of a single language model through self-correction, paving the way for more advanced autonomous agents.

Evaluating Language Models for Efficient Code Generation,"Jiawei Liu, Songrun Xie, Junhao Wang, Yuxiang Wei, Yifeng Ding, Lingming Zhang","We introduce Differential Performance Evaluation (DPE), a framework designed to reliably evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient code generation. Traditional coding benchmarks often fail to provide reliable insights into code efficiency, due to their reliance on simplistic test inputs and the absence of effective compound metrics. DPE addresses these issues by focusing on efficiency-demanding programming tasks and establishing an insightful compound metric for performance evaluation. DPE operates in two phases: To curate efficiency datasets, it selects efficiency-demanding tasks from existing coding benchmarks and generates computationally expensive inputs to stress the efficiency of LLM solutions. To assess the code efficiency, DPE profiles the new solution and compares it globally against a set of reference solutions that exhibit distinct efficiency levels, where the matched level defines its efficiency score. As a proof of concept, we use DPE to create EvalPerf, a benchmark with 121 performance-challenging coding tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation draws interesting findings on the efficiency impact of model sizes, instruction tuning, and prompting. For example, while the scaling law fails to account for code efficiency, general instruction tuning benefits both code correctness and efficiency. We also evaluate the evaluation by examining the effectiveness of DPE, showing that EvalPerf is reliable and convenient to use even across platforms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06450v1,2024-08
Statistical Patterns in the Equations of Physics and the Emergence of a Meta-Law of Nature,"Andrei Constantin, Deaglan Bartlett, Harry Desmond, Pedro G. Ferreira","Physics, as a fundamental science, aims to understand the laws of Nature and describe them in mathematical equations. While the physical reality manifests itself in a wide range of phenomena with varying levels of complexity, the equations that describe them display certain statistical regularities and patterns, which we begin to explore here. By drawing inspiration from linguistics, where Zipf's law states that the frequency of any word in a large corpus of text is roughly inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table, we investigate whether similar patterns for the distribution of operators emerge in the equations of physics. We analyse three corpora of formulae and find, using sophisticated implicit-likelihood methods, that the frequency of operators as a function of their rank in the frequency table is best described by an exponential law with a stable exponent, in contrast with Zipf's inverse power-law. Understanding the underlying reasons behind this statistical pattern may shed light on Nature's modus operandi or reveal recurrent patterns in physicists' attempts to formalise the laws of Nature. It may also provide crucial input for symbolic regression, potentially augmenting language models to generate symbolic models for physical phenomena. By pioneering the study of statistical regularities in the equations of physics, our results open the door for a meta-law of Nature, a (probabilistic) law that all physical laws obey.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11065v1,2024-08
Evaluating LLMs on Entity Disambiguation in Tables,"Federico Belotti, Fabio Dadda, Marco Cremaschi, Roberto Avogadro, Matteo Palmonari","Tables are crucial containers of information, but understanding their meaning may be challenging. Over the years, there has been a surge in interest in data-driven approaches based on deep learning that have increasingly been combined with heuristic-based ones. In the last period, the advent of \acf{llms} has led to a new category of approaches for table annotation. However, these approaches have not been consistently evaluated on a common ground, making evaluation and comparison difficult. This work proposes an extensive evaluation of four STI SOTA approaches: Alligator (formerly s-elbat), Dagobah, TURL, and TableLlama; the first two belong to the family of heuristic-based algorithms, while the others are respectively encoder-only and decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs). We also include in the evaluation both GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, since they excel in various public benchmarks. The primary objective is to measure the ability of these approaches to solve the entity disambiguation task with respect to both the performance achieved on a common-ground evaluation setting and the computational and cost requirements involved, with the ultimate aim of charting new research paths in the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06423v3,2024-08
"LOLgorithm: Integrating Semantic,Syntactic and Contextual Elements for Humor Classification","Tanisha Khurana, Kaushik Pillalamarri, Vikram Pande, Munindar Singh","This paper explores humor detection through a linguistic lens, prioritizing syntactic, semantic, and contextual features over computational methods in Natural Language Processing. We categorize features into syntactic, semantic, and contextual dimensions, including lexicons, structural statistics, Word2Vec, WordNet, and phonetic style. Our proposed model, Colbert, utilizes BERT embeddings and parallel hidden layers to capture sentence congruity. By combining syntactic, semantic, and contextual features, we train Colbert for humor detection. Feature engineering examines essential syntactic and semantic features alongside BERT embeddings. SHAP interpretations and decision trees identify influential features, revealing that a holistic approach improves humor detection accuracy on unseen data. Integrating linguistic cues from different dimensions enhances the model's ability to understand humor complexity beyond traditional computational methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06335v1,2024-08
FastFiD: Improve Inference Efficiency of Open Domain Question Answering via Sentence Selection,"Yufei Huang, Xu Han, Maosong Sun","Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) has been advancing rapidly in recent times, driven by significant developments in dense passage retrieval and pretrained language models. Current models typically incorporate the FiD framework, which is composed by a neural retriever alongside an encoder-decoder neural reader. In the answer generation process, the retriever will retrieve numerous passages (around 100 for instance), each of which is then individually encoded by the encoder. Subsequently, the decoder makes predictions based on these encoded passages. Nevertheless, this framework can be relatively time-consuming, particularly due to the extensive length of the gathered passages. To address this, we introduce FastFiD in this paper, a novel approach that executes sentence selection on the encoded passages. This aids in retaining valuable sentences while reducing the context length required for generating answers. Experiments on three commonly used datasets (Natural Questions, TriviaQA and ASQA) demonstrate that our method can enhance the inference speed by 2.3X-5.7X, while simultaneously maintaining the model's performance. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the model's attention reveals that the selected sentences indeed hold a substantial contribution towards the final answer. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/thunlp/FastFiD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06333v1,2024-08
"Animate, or Inanimate, That is the Question for Large Language Models","Leonardo Ranaldi, Giulia Pucci, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto","The cognitive essence of humans is deeply intertwined with the concept of animacy, which plays an essential role in shaping their memory, vision, and multi-layered language understanding. Although animacy appears in language via nuanced constraints on verbs and adjectives, it is also learned and refined through extralinguistic information. Similarly, we assume that the LLMs' limited abilities to understand natural language when processing animacy are motivated by the fact that these models are trained exclusively on text.   Hence, the question this paper aims to answer arises: can LLMs, in their digital wisdom, process animacy in a similar way to what humans would do? We then propose a systematic analysis via prompting approaches. In particular, we probe different LLMs by prompting them using animate, inanimate, usual, and stranger contexts. Results reveal that, although LLMs have been trained predominantly on textual data, they exhibit human-like behavior when faced with typical animate and inanimate entities in alignment with earlier studies. Hence, LLMs can adapt to understand unconventional situations by recognizing oddities as animated without needing to interface with unspoken cognitive triggers humans rely on to break down animations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06332v1,2024-08

These agents are postulated to excel across a myriad of tasks, potentially approaching general artificial intelligence. However, existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge or showcase the full potential of LMMs in complex, real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and pioneering benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across nine proprietary LMM APIs and eight open models, we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB constructs a trajectory training set constructed through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, promoting substantial performance improvements in LMMs through behavior cloning. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides a solid foundation for future development into visual foundation agents.

Long-Form Answers to Visual Questions from Blind and Low Vision People,"Mina Huh, Fangyuan Xu, Yi-Hao Peng, Chongyan Chen, Hansika Murugu, Danna Gurari, Eunsol Choi, Amy Pavel","Vision language models can now generate long-form answers to questions about images - long-form visual question answers (LFVQA). We contribute VizWiz-LF, a dataset of long-form answers to visual questions posed by blind and low vision (BLV) users. VizWiz-LF contains 4.2k long-form answers to 600 visual questions, collected from human expert describers and six VQA models. We develop and annotate functional roles of sentences of LFVQA and demonstrate that long-form answers contain information beyond the question answer such as explanations and suggestions. We further conduct automatic and human evaluations with BLV and sighted people to evaluate long-form answers. BLV people perceive both human-written and generated long-form answers to be plausible, but generated answers often hallucinate incorrect visual details, especially for unanswerable visual questions (e.g., blurry or irrelevant images). To reduce hallucinations, we evaluate the ability of VQA models to abstain from answering unanswerable questions across multiple prompting strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06303v1,2024-08
The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery,"Chris Lu, Cong Lu, Robert Tjarko Lange, Jakob Foerster, Jeff Clune, David Ha","One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

Synthetic Patient-Physician Dialogue Generation from Clinical Notes Using LLM,"Trisha Das, Dina Albassam, Jimeng Sun","Medical dialogue systems (MDS) enhance patient-physician communication, improve healthcare accessibility, and reduce costs. However, acquiring suitable data to train these systems poses significant challenges. Privacy concerns prevent the use of real conversations, necessitating synthetic alternatives. Synthetic dialogue generation from publicly available clinical notes offers a promising solution to this issue, providing realistic data while safeguarding privacy. Our approach, SynDial, uses a single LLM iteratively with zero-shot prompting and a feedback loop to generate and refine high-quality synthetic dialogues. The feedback consists of weighted evaluation scores for similarity and extractiveness. The iterative process ensures dialogues meet predefined thresholds, achieving superior extractiveness as a result of the feedback loop. Additionally, evaluation shows that the generated dialogues excel in factuality metric compared to the baselines and has comparable diversity scores with GPT4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06285v1,2024-08
MovieSum: An Abstractive Summarization Dataset for Movie Screenplays,"Rohit Saxena, Frank Keller","Movie screenplay summarization is challenging, as it requires an understanding of long input contexts and various elements unique to movies. Large language models have shown significant advancements in document summarization, but they often struggle with processing long input contexts. Furthermore, while television transcripts have received attention in recent studies, movie screenplay summarization remains underexplored. To stimulate research in this area, we present a new dataset, MovieSum, for abstractive summarization of movie screenplays. This dataset comprises 2200 movie screenplays accompanied by their Wikipedia plot summaries. We manually formatted the movie screenplays to represent their structural elements. Compared to existing datasets, MovieSum possesses several distinctive features: (1) It includes movie screenplays, which are longer than scripts of TV episodes. (2) It is twice the size of previous movie screenplay datasets. (3) It provides metadata with IMDb IDs to facilitate access to additional external knowledge. We also show the results of recently released large language models applied to summarization on our dataset to provide a detailed baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06281v1,2024-08
Review-driven Personalized Preference Reasoning with Large Language Models for Recommendation,"Jieyong Kim, Hyunseo Kim, Hyunjin Cho, SeongKu Kang, Buru Chang, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, generating significant interest in their application to recommendation systems. However, existing methods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrained by limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, a novel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference information contained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned through distillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RT first extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from raw reviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria to create user and item profiles. It then generates detailed step-by-step reasoning followed by predicted rating, i.e., reasoning-enhanced rating prediction, by considering both subjective and objective information from user/item profiles and item descriptions. This personalized preference reasoning from EXP3RT enhances rating prediction accuracy and also provides faithful and reasonable explanations for recommendation. Extensive experiments show that EXP3RT outperforms existing methods on both rating prediction and candidate item reranking for top-k recommendation, while significantly enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06276v3,2024-08

However, many LLMs exhibit significant performance discrepancies between high- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this challenge, we present FuxiTranyu, an open-source multilingual LLM, which is designed to satisfy the need of the research community for balanced and high-performing multilingual capabilities. The base model, FuxiTranyu-8B, features 8 billion parameters and is trained from scratch on meticulously balanced multilingual data that contains 600 billion tokens covering 43 natural languages and 16 programming languages.

Anchored Preference Optimization and Contrastive Revisions: Addressing Underspecification in Alignment,"Karel D'Oosterlinck, Winnie Xu, Chris Develder, Thomas Demeester, Amanpreet Singh, Christopher Potts, Douwe Kiela, Shikib Mehri","Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignment objectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paired data, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimes producing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data gives a better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and (ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify more control over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduce Contrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method which leads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored Preference Optimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. We align Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignment objectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with human judgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of all datasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives.

On Effects of Steering Latent Representation for Large Language Model Unlearning,"Dang Huu-Tien, Trung-Tin Pham, Hoang Thanh-Tung, Naoya Inoue","Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning. Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses. We investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers. We show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs. To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06223v2,2024-08

Mutual Reasoning Makes Smaller LLMs Stronger Problem-Solvers,"Zhenting Qi, Mingyuan Ma, Jiahang Xu, Li Lyna Zhang, Fan Yang, Mao Yang","This paper introduces rStar, a self-play mutual reasoning approach that significantly improves reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) without fine-tuning or superior models. rStar decouples reasoning into a self-play mutual generation-discrimination process. First, a target SLM augments the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a rich set of human-like reasoning actions to construct higher quality reasoning trajectories. Next, another SLM, with capabilities similar to the target SLM, acts as a discriminator to verify each trajectory generated by the target SLM. The mutually agreed reasoning trajectories are considered mutual consistent, thus are more likely to be correct. Extensive experiments across five SLMs demonstrate rStar can effectively solve diverse reasoning problems, including GSM8K, GSM-Hard, MATH, SVAMP, and StrategyQA. Remarkably, rStar boosts GSM8K accuracy from 12.51% to 63.91% for LLaMA2-7B, from 36.46% to 81.88% for Mistral-7B, from 74.53% to 91.13% for LLaMA3-8B-Instruct.

Improving Structural Diversity of Blackbox LLMs via Chain-of-Specification Prompting,"Halley Young, Yimeng Zeng, Jacob Gardner, Osbert Bastani","The capability to generate diverse text is a key challenge facing large language models (LLMs). Thus far, diversity has been studied via metrics such as $n$-gram diversity or diversity of BERT embeddings. However, for these kinds of diversity, the user has little control over the dimensions along which diversity is considered. For example, in the poetry domain, one might desire diversity in terms of rhyme and meter, whereas in the code domain, one might desire diversity in terms of the kinds of expressions used to solve a problem. We propose a diversity metric called structural diversity, where the user provides a mapping from generated text to features capturing the kinds of diversity that they care about. In addition, we propose a novel strategy called chain-of-specification (CoS) prompting for improving diversity by first having the LLM generate a specification encoding one instance of structural features, and then prompting the LLM to generate text that satisfies these features; notably, our strategy works with blackbox LLMs. In our experiments, we show that for structural diversity in the poetry and code domains, CoS significantly improves diversity compared to several baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06186v1,2024-08

The proposed bilingual LipidBERT model operates in two languages: the language of ionizable lipid pre-training, using in-house dry-lab lipid structures, and the language of LNP fine-tuning, utilizing in-house LNP wet-lab data. This dual capability positions LipidBERT as a key AI-based filter for future screening tasks, including new versions of METiS de novo lipid libraries and, more importantly, candidates for in vivo testing for orgran-targeting LNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of the capability of a pre-trained language model on virtual lipids and its effectiveness in downstream tasks using web-lab data. This work showcases the clever utilization of METiS's in-house de novo lipid library as well as the power of dry-wet lab integration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06150v2,2024-08
Med42-v2: A Suite of Clinical LLMs,"Clément Christophe, Praveen K Kanithi, Tathagata Raha, Shadab Khan, Marco AF Pimentel","Med42-v2 introduces a suite of clinical large language models (LLMs) designed to address the limitations of generic models in healthcare settings. These models are built on Llama3 architecture and fine-tuned using specialized clinical data. They underwent multi-stage preference alignment to effectively respond to natural prompts. While generic models are often preference-aligned to avoid answering clinical queries as a precaution, Med42-v2 is specifically trained to overcome this limitation, enabling its use in clinical settings. Med42-v2 models demonstrate superior performance compared to the original Llama3 models in both 8B and 70B parameter configurations and GPT-4 across various medical benchmarks. These LLMs are developed to understand clinical queries, perform reasoning tasks, and provide valuable assistance in clinical environments. The models are now publicly available at \href{https://huggingface.co/m42-health}{https://huggingface.co/m42-health}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06142v1,2024-08
Speech vs. Transcript: Does It Matter for Human Annotators in Speech Summarization?,"Roshan Sharma, Suwon Shon, Mark Lindsey, Hira Dhamyal, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj","Reference summaries for abstractive speech summarization require human annotation, which can be performed by listening to an audio recording or by reading textual transcripts of the recording. In this paper, we examine whether summaries based on annotators listening to the recordings differ from those based on annotators reading transcripts. Using existing intrinsic evaluation based on human evaluation, automatic metrics, LLM-based evaluation, and a retrieval-based reference-free method. We find that summaries are indeed different based on the source modality, and that speech-based summaries are more factually consistent and information-selective than transcript-based summaries. Meanwhile, transcript-based summaries are impacted by recognition errors in the source, and expert-written summaries are more informative and reliable. We make all the collected data and analysis code public(https://github.com/cmu-mlsp/interview_humanssum) to facilitate the reproduction of our work and advance research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07277v1,2024-08
Utilize Transformers for translating Wikipedia category names,"Hoang-Thang Ta, Quoc Thang La","On Wikipedia, articles are categorized to aid readers in navigating content efficiently. The manual creation of new categories can be laborious and time-intensive. To tackle this issue, we built language models to translate Wikipedia categories from English to Vietnamese with a dataset containing 15,000 English-Vietnamese category pairs. Subsequently, small to medium-scale Transformer pre-trained models with a sequence-to-sequence architecture were fine-tuned for category translation. The experiments revealed that OPUS-MT-en-vi surpassed other models, attaining the highest performance with a BLEU score of 0.73, despite its smaller model storage. We expect our paper to be an alternative solution for translation tasks with limited computer resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06124v1,2024-08
How ChatGPT Changed the Media's Narratives on AI: A Semi-Automated Narrative Analysis Through Frame Semantics,"Igor Ryazanov, Carl Öhman, Johanna Björklund","We perform a mixed-method frame semantics-based analysis on a dataset of more than 49,000 sentences collected from 5846 news articles that mention AI. The dataset covers the twelve-month period centred around the launch of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT and is collected from the most visited open-access English-language news publishers. Our findings indicate that during the six months succeeding the launch, media attention rose tenfold$\unicode{x2014}$from already historically high levels. During this period, discourse has become increasingly centred around experts and political leaders, and AI has become more closely associated with dangers and risks. A deeper review of the data also suggests a qualitative shift in the types of threat AI is thought to represent, as well as the anthropomorphic qualities ascribed to it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06120v2,2024-08
Building Decision Making Models Through Language Model Regime,"Yu Zhang, Haoxiang Liu, Feijun Jiang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang","We propose a novel approach for decision making problems leveraging the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Traditional methods such as expert systems, planning algorithms, and reinforcement learning often exhibit limited generalization, typically requiring the training of new models for each unique task. In contrast, LLMs demonstrate remarkable success in generalizing across varied language tasks, inspiring a new strategy for training decision making models. Our approach, referred to as ""Learning then Using"" (LTU), entails a two-stage process. Initially, the \textit{learning} phase develops a robust foundational decision making model by integrating diverse knowledge from various domains and decision making contexts. The subsequent \textit{using} phase refines this foundation model for specific decision making scenarios. Distinct from other studies that employ LLMs for decision making through supervised learning, our LTU method embraces a versatile training methodology that combines broad pre-training with targeted fine-tuning. Experiments in e-commerce domains such as advertising and search optimization have shown that LTU approach outperforms traditional supervised learning regimes in decision making capabilities and generalization. The LTU approach is the first practical training architecture for both single-step and multi-step decision making tasks combined with LLMs, which can be applied beyond game and robot domains. It provides a robust and adaptable framework for decision making, enhances the effectiveness and flexibility of various systems in tackling various challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06087v1,2024-08
An Investigation Into Explainable Audio Hate Speech Detection,"Jinmyeong An, Wonjun Lee, Yejin Jeon, Jungseul Ok, Yunsu Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee","Research on hate speech has predominantly revolved around detection and interpretation from textual inputs, leaving verbal content largely unexplored. While there has been limited exploration into hate speech detection within verbal acoustic speech inputs, the aspect of interpretability has been overlooked. Therefore, we introduce a new task of explainable audio hate speech detection. Specifically, we aim to identify the precise time intervals, referred to as audio frame-level rationales, which serve as evidence for hate speech classification. Towards this end, we propose two different approaches: cascading and End-to-End (E2E). The cascading approach initially converts audio to transcripts, identifies hate speech within these transcripts, and subsequently locates the corresponding audio time frames. Conversely, the E2E approach processes audio utterances directly, which allows it to pinpoint hate speech within specific time frames. Additionally, due to the lack of explainable audio hate speech datasets that include audio frame-level rationales, we curated a synthetic audio dataset to train our models. We further validated these models on actual human speech utterances and found that the E2E approach outperforms the cascading method in terms of the audio frame Intersection over Union (IoU) metric. Furthermore, we observed that including frame-level rationales significantly enhances hate speech detection accuracy for the E2E approach.   \textbf{Disclaimer} The reader may encounter content of an offensive or hateful nature. However, given the nature of the work, this cannot be avoided.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06065v1,2024-08
"On Tables with Numbers, with Numbers","Konstantinos Kogkalidis, Stergios Chatzikyriakidis","This paper is a critical reflection on the epistemic culture of contemporary computational linguistics, framed in the context of its growing obsession with tables with numbers. We argue against tables with numbers on the basis of their epistemic irrelevance, their environmental impact, their role in enabling and exacerbating social inequalities, and their deep ties to commercial applications and profit-driven research. We substantiate our arguments with empirical evidence drawn from a meta-analysis of computational linguistics research over the last decade.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06062v3,2024-08
Density Matrices for Metaphor Understanding,"Jay Owers, Ekaterina Shutova, Martha Lewis","In physics, density matrices are used to represent mixed states, i.e. probabilistic mixtures of pure states. This concept has previously been used to model lexical ambiguity. In this paper, we consider metaphor as a type of lexical ambiguity, and examine whether metaphorical meaning can be effectively modelled using mixtures of word senses. We find that modelling metaphor is significantly more difficult than other kinds of lexical ambiguity, but that our best-performing density matrix method outperforms simple baselines as well as some neural language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11846v1,2024-08
Quantum Algorithms for Compositional Text Processing,"Tuomas Laakkonen, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis, Bob Coecke","Quantum computing and AI have found a fruitful intersection in the field of natural language processing. We focus on the recently proposed DisCoCirc framework for natural language, and propose a quantum adaptation, QDisCoCirc. This is motivated by a compositional approach to rendering AI interpretable: the behavior of the whole can be understood in terms of the behavior of parts, and the way they are put together. For the model-native primitive operation of text similarity, we derive quantum algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computers to solve the task of question-answering within QDisCoCirc, and show that this is BQP-hard; note that we do not consider the complexity of question-answering in other natural language processing models. Assuming widely-held conjectures, implementing the proposed model classically would require super-polynomial resources. Therefore, it could provide a meaningful demonstration of the power of practical quantum processors. The model construction builds on previous work in compositional quantum natural language processing. Word embeddings are encoded as parameterized quantum circuits, and compositionality here means that the quantum circuits compose according to the linguistic structure of the text. We outline a method for evaluating the model on near-term quantum processors, and elsewhere we report on a recent implementation of this on quantum hardware. In addition, we adapt a quantum algorithm for the closest vector problem to obtain a Grover-like speedup in the fault-tolerant regime for our model. This provides an unconditional quadratic speedup over any classical algorithm in certain circumstances, which we will verify empirically in future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06061v1,2024-08
DiagESC: Dialogue Synthesis for Integrating Depression Diagnosis into Emotional Support Conversation,"Seungyeon Seo, Gary Geunbae Lee","Dialogue systems for mental health care aim to provide appropriate support to individuals experiencing mental distress. While extensive research has been conducted to deliver adequate emotional support, existing studies cannot identify individuals who require professional medical intervention and cannot offer suitable guidance. We introduce the Diagnostic Emotional Support Conversation task for an advanced mental health management system. We develop the DESC dataset to assess depression symptoms while maintaining user experience by utilizing task-specific utterance generation prompts and a strict filtering algorithm. Evaluations by professional psychological counselors indicate that DESC has a superior ability to diagnose depression than existing data. Additionally, conversational quality evaluation reveals that DESC maintains fluent, consistent, and coherent dialogues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06044v1,2024-08
Enhancing Dialogue Speech Recognition with Robust Contextual Awareness via Noise Representation Learning,"Wonjun Lee, San Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee","Recent dialogue systems rely on turn-based spoken interactions, requiring accurate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Errors in ASR can significantly impact downstream dialogue tasks. To address this, using dialogue context from user and agent interactions for transcribing subsequent utterances has been proposed. This method incorporates the transcription of the user's speech and the agent's response as model input, using the accumulated context generated by each turn. However, this context is susceptible to ASR errors because it is generated by the ASR model in an auto-regressive fashion. Such noisy context can further degrade the benefits of context input, resulting in suboptimal ASR performance. In this paper, we introduce Context Noise Representation Learning (CNRL) to enhance robustness against noisy context, ultimately improving dialogue speech recognition accuracy. To maximize the advantage of context awareness, our approach includes decoder pre-training using text-based dialogue data and noise representation learning for a context encoder. Based on the evaluation of speech dialogues, our method shows superior results compared to baselines. Furthermore, the strength of our approach is highlighted in noisy environments where user speech is barely audible due to real-world noise, relying on contextual information to transcribe the input accurately.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06043v1,2024-08
ARPA: A Novel Hybrid Model for Advancing Visual Word Disambiguation Using Large Language Models and Transformers,"Aristi Papastavrou, Maria Lymperaiou, Giorgos Stamou","In the rapidly evolving fields of natural language processing and computer vision, Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) stands as a critical, yet challenging task. The quest for models that can seamlessly integrate and interpret multimodal data is more pressing than ever. Imagine a system that can understand language with the depth and nuance of human cognition, while simultaneously interpreting the rich visual context of the world around it.   We present ARPA, an architecture that fuses the unparalleled contextual understanding of large language models with the advanced feature extraction capabilities of transformers, which then pass through a custom Graph Neural Network (GNN) layer to learn intricate relationships and subtle nuances within the data. This innovative architecture not only sets a new benchmark in visual word disambiguation but also introduces a versatile framework poised to transform how linguistic and visual data interact by harnessing the synergistic strengths of its components, ensuring robust performance even in the most complex disambiguation scenarios. Through a series of experiments and comparative analysis, we reveal the substantial advantages of our model, underscoring its potential to redefine standards in the field. Beyond its architectural prowess, our architecture excels through experimental enrichments, including sophisticated data augmentation and multi-modal training techniques.   ARPA's introduction marks a significant milestone in visual word disambiguation, offering a compelling solution that bridges the gap between linguistic and visual modalities. We invite researchers and practitioners to explore the capabilities of our model, envisioning a future where such hybrid models drive unprecedented advancements in artificial intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06040v1,2024-08
Controlling Surprisal in Music Generation via Information Content Curve Matching,"Mathias Rose Bjare, Stefan Lattner, Gerhard Widmer","In recent years, the quality and public interest in music generation systems have grown, encouraging research into various ways to control these systems. We propose a novel method for controlling surprisal in music generation using sequence models. To achieve this goal, we define a metric called Instantaneous Information Content (IIC). The IIC serves as a proxy function for the perceived musical surprisal (as estimated from a probabilistic model) and can be calculated at any point within a music piece. This enables the comparison of surprisal across different musical content even if the musical events occur in irregular time intervals. We use beam search to generate musical material whose IIC curve closely approximates a given target IIC. We experimentally show that the IIC correlates with harmonic and rhythmic complexity and note density. The correlation decreases with the length of the musical context used for estimating the IIC. Finally, we conduct a qualitative user study to test if human listeners can identify the IIC curves that have been used as targets when generating the respective musical material. We provide code for creating IIC interpolations and IIC visualizations on https://github.com/muthissar/iic.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06022v1,2024-08
Global-to-Local Support Spectrums for Language Model Explainability,"Lucas Agussurja, Xinyang Lu, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","Existing sample-based methods, like influence functions and representer points, measure the importance of a training point by approximating the effect of its removal from training. As such, they are skewed towards outliers and points that are very close to the decision boundaries. The explanations provided by these methods are often static and not specific enough for different test points. In this paper, we propose a method to generate an explanation in the form of support spectrums which are based on two main ideas: the support sets and a global-to-local importance measure. The support set is the set of training points, in the predicted class, that ``lie in between'' the test point and training points in the other classes. They indicate how well the test point can be distinguished from the points not in the predicted class. The global-to-local importance measure is obtained by decoupling existing methods into the global and local components which are then used to select the points in the support set. Using this method, we are able to generate explanations that are tailored to specific test points. In the experiments, we show the effectiveness of the method in image classification and text generation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05976v1,2024-08
The Language of Trauma: Modeling Traumatic Event Descriptions Across Domains with Explainable AI,"Miriam Schirmer, Tobias Leemann, Gjergji Kasneci, Jürgen Pfeffer, David Jurgens","Psychological trauma can manifest following various distressing events and is captured in diverse online contexts. However, studies traditionally focus on a single aspect of trauma, often neglecting the transferability of findings across different scenarios. We address this gap by training language models with progressing complexity on trauma-related datasets, including genocide-related court data, a Reddit dataset on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), counseling conversations, and Incel forum posts. Our results show that the fine-tuned RoBERTa model excels in predicting traumatic events across domains, slightly outperforming large language models like GPT-4. Additionally, SLALOM-feature scores and conceptual explanations effectively differentiate and cluster trauma-related language, highlighting different trauma aspects and identifying sexual abuse and experiences related to death as a common traumatic event across all datasets. This transferability is crucial as it allows for the development of tools to enhance trauma detection and intervention in diverse populations and settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05977v1,2024-08
ConvKGYarn: Spinning Configurable and Scalable Conversational Knowledge Graph QA datasets with Large Language Models,"Ronak Pradeep, Daniel Lee, Ali Mousavi, Jeff Pound, Yisi Sang, Jimmy Lin, Ihab Ilyas, Saloni Potdar, Mostafa Arefiyan, Yunyao Li","The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and conversational assistants necessitates dynamic, scalable, and configurable conversational datasets for training and evaluation. These datasets must accommodate diverse user interaction modes, including text and voice, each presenting unique modeling challenges. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured and evolving nature, offer an ideal foundation for current and precise knowledge. Although human-curated KG-based conversational datasets exist, they struggle to keep pace with the rapidly changing user information needs. We present ConvKGYarn, a scalable method for generating up-to-date and configurable conversational KGQA datasets. Qualitative psychometric analyses confirm our method can generate high-quality datasets rivaling a popular conversational KGQA dataset while offering it at scale and covering a wide range of human-interaction configurations. We showcase its utility by testing LLMs on diverse conversations - exploring model behavior on conversational KGQA sets with different configurations grounded in the same KG fact set. Our results highlight the ability of ConvKGYarn to improve KGQA foundations and evaluate parametric knowledge of LLMs, thus offering a robust solution to the constantly evolving landscape of conversational assistants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05948v1,2024-08
A New Pipeline For Generating Instruction Dataset via RAG and Self Fine-Tuning,"Chih-Wei Song, Yu-Kai Lee, Yin-Te Tsai","With the rapid development of large language models in recent years, there has been an increasing demand for domain-specific Agents that can cater to the unique needs of enterprises and organizations. Unlike general models, which strive for broad coverage, these specialized Agents rely on focused datasets tailored to their intended applications. This research proposes a pipeline that leverages the power of LLMs and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation related framework to construct high-quality instruction datasets for fine-tuning on specific domains using custom document collections. By ingesting domain-specific documents, the pipeline generates relevant and contextually appropriate instructions, thus effectively creating a comprehensive dataset for fine-tuning LLMs on the target domain. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional dataset creation methods, which often rely on manual curation or web-scraping techniques that may introduce noise and irrelevant data. Notably, our pipeline offers a dynamic solution that can quickly adapt to updates or modifications in the domain-specific document collection, eliminating the need for complete retraining. Additionally, it addresses the challenge of data scarcity by enabling the generation of instruction datasets from a limited set of initial documents, rendering it suitable for unpopular or specialized domains where comprehensive datasets are scarce. As a case study, we apply this approach to the domain of psychiatry, a field requiring specialized knowledge and sensitive handling of patient information. The resulting fine-tuned LLM demonstrates showcases the viability of the proposed approach and underscores its potential for widespread adoption across various industries and domains where tailored, accurate, and contextually relevant language models are indispensable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05911v1,2024-08

We propose AdTEC, the first public benchmark to evaluate ad texts in multiple aspects from the perspective of practical advertising operations. Our contributions are: (i) Defining five tasks for evaluating the quality of ad texts and building a dataset based on the actual operational experience of advertising agencies, which is typically kept in-house. (ii) Validating the performance of existing pre-trained language models (PLMs) and human evaluators on the dataset. (iii) Analyzing the characteristics and providing challenges of the benchmark.

GlyphPattern: An Abstract Pattern Recognition for Vision-Language Models,"Zixuan Wu, Yoolim Kim, Carolyn Jane Anderson","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) building upon the foundation of powerful large language models have made rapid progress in reasoning across visual and textual data. While VLMs perform well on vision tasks that they are trained on, our results highlight key challenges in abstract pattern recognition. We present GlyphPattern, a 954 item dataset that pairs 318 human-written descriptions of visual patterns from 40 writing systems with three visual presentation styles.   GlyphPattern evaluates abstract pattern recognition in VLMs, requiring models to understand and judge natural language descriptions of visual patterns. GlyphPattern patterns are drawn from a large-scale cognitive science investigation of human writing systems; as a result, they are rich in spatial reference and compositionality. Our experiments show that GlyphPattern is challenging for state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o achieves only 55% accuracy), with marginal gains from few-shot prompting. Our detailed error analysis reveals challenges at multiple levels, including visual processing, natural language understanding, and pattern generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05894v1,2024-08
Creating Arabic LLM Prompts at Scale,"Abdelrahman El-Sheikh, Ahmed Elmogtaba, Kareem Darwish, Muhammad Elmallah, Ashraf Elneima, Hassan Sawaf","The debut of chatGPT and BARD has popularized instruction following text generation using LLMs, where a user can interrogate an LLM using natural language requests and obtain natural language answers that matches their requests. Training LLMs to respond in this manner requires a large number of worked out examples of user requests (aka prompts) with corresponding gold responses. In this paper, we introduce two methods for creating such prompts for Arabic cheaply and quickly. The first methods entails automatically translating existing prompt datasets from English, such as PromptSource and Super-NaturalInstructions, and then using machine translation quality estimation to retain high quality translations only. The second method involves creating natural language prompts on top of existing Arabic NLP datasets. Using these two methods we were able to create more than 67.4 million Arabic prompts that cover a variety of tasks including summarization, headline generation, grammar checking, open/closed question answering, creative writing, etc. We show that fine tuning an open 7 billion parameter large language model, namely base Qwen2 7B, enables it to outperform a state-of-the-art 70 billion parameter instruction tuned model, namely Llama3 70B, in handling Arabic prompts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05882v1,2024-08
LLM-Based Robust Product Classification in Commerce and Compliance,"Sina Gholamian, Gianfranco Romani, Bartosz Rudnikowicz, Stavroula Skylaki","Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories. Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05874v2,2024-08

This paper addresses the need for LLMs to recognize and refuse infeasible tasks due to the required skills surpassing their capabilities. We first conceptualize infeasible tasks for LLMs and provide categorizations that cover a spectrum of related hallucinations over existing literature. We develop and benchmark a new dataset comprising diverse infeasible and feasible tasks to evaluate multiple LLMs' abilities to reject infeasible tasks. Furthermore, we explore the potential of increasing LLMs' refusal capabilities with fine-tuning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our trained models, offering promising directions for refining the operational boundaries of LLMs in real applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05873v2,2024-08
Kov: Transferable and Naturalistic Black-Box LLM Attacks using Markov Decision Processes and Tree Search,Robert J. Moss,"Eliciting harmful behavior from large language models (LLMs) is an important task to ensure the proper alignment and safety of the models. Often when training LLMs, ethical guidelines are followed yet alignment failures may still be uncovered through red teaming adversarial attacks. This work frames the red-teaming problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and uses Monte Carlo tree search to find harmful behaviors of black-box, closed-source LLMs. We optimize token-level prompt suffixes towards targeted harmful behaviors on white-box LLMs and include a naturalistic loss term, log-perplexity, to generate more natural language attacks for better interpretability. The proposed algorithm, Kov, trains on white-box LLMs to optimize the adversarial attacks and periodically evaluates responses from the black-box LLM to guide the search towards more harmful black-box behaviors. In our preliminary study, results indicate that we can jailbreak black-box models, such as GPT-3.5, in only 10 queries, yet fail on GPT-4$-$which may indicate that newer models are more robust to token-level attacks. All work to reproduce these results is open sourced (https://github.com/sisl/Kov.jl).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08899v1,2024-08
Multitask Fine-Tuning and Generative Adversarial Learning for Improved Auxiliary Classification,"Christopher Sun, Abishek Satish","In this study, we implement a novel BERT architecture for multitask fine-tuning on three downstream tasks: sentiment classification, paraphrase detection, and semantic textual similarity prediction. Our model, Multitask BERT, incorporates layer sharing and a triplet architecture, custom sentence pair tokenization, loss pairing, and gradient surgery. Such optimizations yield a 0.516 sentiment classification accuracy, 0.886 paraphase detection accuracy, and 0.864 semantic textual similarity correlation on test data. We also apply generative adversarial learning to BERT, constructing a conditional generator model that maps from latent space to create fake embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^{768}$. These fake embeddings are concatenated with real BERT embeddings and passed into a discriminator model for auxiliary classification. Using this framework, which we refer to as AC-GAN-BERT, we conduct semi-supervised sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of increasing amounts of unlabeled training data on AC-GAN-BERT's test accuracy. Overall, aside from implementing a high-performing multitask classification system, our novelty lies in the application of adversarial learning to construct a generator that mimics BERT. We find that the conditional generator successfully produces rich embeddings with clear spatial correlation with class labels, demonstrating avoidance of mode collapse. Our findings validate the GAN-BERT approach and point to future directions of generator-aided knowledge distillation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15265v1,2024-08
Post-Training Sparse Attention with Double Sparsity,"Shuo Yang, Ying Sheng, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica, Lianmin Zheng","The inference process for large language models is slow and memory-intensive, with one of the most critical bottlenecks being excessive Key-Value (KV) cache accesses. This paper introduces ""Double Sparsity,"" a novel post-training sparse attention technique designed to alleviate this bottleneck by reducing KV cache access. Double Sparsity combines token sparsity, which focuses on utilizing only the important tokens for computing self-attention, with channel sparsity, an approach that uses important feature channels for identifying important tokens. Our key insight is that the pattern of channel sparsity is relatively static, allowing us to use offline calibration to make it efficient at runtime, thereby enabling accurate and efficient identification of important tokens. Moreover, this method can be combined with offloading to achieve significant memory usage reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that Double Sparsity can achieve $\frac{1}{16}$ token and channel sparsity with minimal impact on accuracy across various tasks, including wiki-2 perplexity, key-value retrieval, and long context benchmarks with models including Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B. It brings up to a 14.1$\times$ acceleration in attention operations and a 1.9$\times$ improvement in end-to-end inference on GPUs. With offloading, it achieves a decoding speed acceleration of 16.3$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions at a sequence length of 256K.

Iterative Improvement of an Additively Regularized Topic Model,"Alex Gorbulev, Vasiliy Alekseev, Konstantin Vorontsov","Topic modelling is fundamentally a soft clustering problem (of known objects -- documents, over unknown clusters -- topics). That is, the task is incorrectly posed. In particular, the topic models are unstable and incomplete. All this leads to the fact that the process of finding a good topic model (repeated hyperparameter selection, model training, and topic quality assessment) can be particularly long and labor-intensive. We aim to simplify the process, to make it more deterministic and provable. To this end, we present a method for iterative training of a topic model. The essence of the method is that a series of related topic models are trained so that each subsequent model is at least as good as the previous one, i.e., that it retains all the good topics found earlier. The connection between the models is achieved by additive regularization. The result of this iterative training is the last topic model in the series, which we call the iteratively updated additively regularized topic model (ITAR). Experiments conducted on several collections of natural language texts show that the proposed ITAR model performs better than other popular topic models (LDA, ARTM, BERTopic), its topics are diverse, and its perplexity (ability to ""explain"" the underlying data) is moderate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05840v3,2024-08
HateSieve: A Contrastive Learning Framework for Detecting and Segmenting Hateful Content in Multimodal Memes,"Xuanyu Su, Yansong Li, Diana Inkpen, Nathalie Japkowicz","Amidst the rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and their widespread application in generating and interpreting complex content, the risk of propagating biased and harmful memes remains significant.

To address this, we introduce \textsc{HateSieve}, a new framework designed to enhance the detection and segmentation of hateful elements in memes. \textsc{HateSieve} features a novel Contrastive Meme Generator that creates semantically paired memes, a customized triplet dataset for contrastive learning, and an Image-Text Alignment module that produces context-aware embeddings for accurate meme segmentation. Empirical experiments on the Hateful Meme Dataset show that \textsc{HateSieve} not only surpasses existing LMMs in performance with fewer trainable parameters but also offers a robust mechanism for precisely identifying and isolating hateful content. \textcolor{red}{Caution: Contains academic discussions of hate speech; viewer discretion advised.}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05794v1,2024-08
SAGA: A Participant-specific Examination of Story Alternatives and Goal Applicability for a Deeper Understanding of Complex Events,"Sai Vallurupalli, Katrin Erk, Francis Ferraro","Interpreting and assessing goal driven actions is vital to understanding and reasoning over complex events. It is important to be able to acquire the knowledge needed for this understanding, though doing so is challenging. We argue that such knowledge can be elicited through a participant achievement lens. We analyze a complex event in a narrative according to the intended achievements of the participants in that narrative, the likely future actions of the participants, and the likelihood of goal success. We collect 6.3K high quality goal and action annotations reflecting our proposed participant achievement lens, with an average weighted Fleiss-Kappa IAA of 80%. Our collection contains annotated alternate versions of each narrative. These alternate versions vary minimally from the ""original"" story, but can license drastically different inferences. Our findings suggest that while modern large language models can reflect some of the goal-based knowledge we study, they find it challenging to fully capture the design and intent behind concerted actions, even when the model pretraining included the data from which we extracted the goal knowledge. We show that smaller models fine-tuned on our dataset can achieve performance surpassing larger models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05793v1,2024-08
HiLight: A Hierarchy-aware Light Global Model with Hierarchical Local ConTrastive Learning,"Zhijian Chen, Zhonghua Li, Jianxin Yang, Ye Qi","Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a special sub-task of multi-label classification (MLC) whose taxonomy is constructed as a tree and each sample is assigned with at least one path in the tree. Latest HTC models contain three modules: a text encoder, a structure encoder and a multi-label classification head. Specially, the structure encoder is designed to encode the hierarchy of taxonomy. However, the structure encoder has scale problem. As the taxonomy size increases, the learnable parameters of recent HTC works grow rapidly. Recursive regularization is another widely-used method to introduce hierarchical information but it has collapse problem and generally relaxed by assigning with a small weight (ie. 1e-6). In this paper, we propose a Hierarchy-aware Light Global model with Hierarchical local conTrastive learning (HiLight), a lightweight and efficient global model only consisting of a text encoder and a multi-label classification head. We propose a new learning task to introduce the hierarchical information, called Hierarchical Local Contrastive Learning (HiLCL). Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05786v1,2024-08
LI-TTA: Language Informed Test-Time Adaptation for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Eunseop Yoon, Hee Suk Yoon, John Harvill, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, Chang D. Yoo","Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a crucial solution to the domain shift challenge, wherein the target environment diverges from the original training environment. A prime exemplification is TTA for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which enhances model performance by leveraging output prediction entropy minimization as a self-supervision signal. However, a key limitation of this self-supervision lies in its primary focus on acoustic features, with minimal attention to the linguistic properties of the input. To address this gap, we propose Language Informed Test-Time Adaptation (LI-TTA), which incorporates linguistic insights during TTA for ASR. LI-TTA integrates corrections from an external language model to merge linguistic with acoustic information by minimizing the CTC loss from the correction alongside the standard TTA loss. With extensive experiments, we show that LI-TTA effectively improves the performance of TTA for ASR in various distribution shift situations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05769v1,2024-08
Reference-free Hallucination Detection for Large Vision-Language Models,"Qing Li, Jiahui Geng, Chenyang Lyu, Derui Zhu, Maxim Panov, Fakhri Karray","Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years. While LVLMs exhibit excellent ability in language understanding, question answering, and conversations of visual inputs, they are prone to producing hallucinations. While several methods are proposed to evaluate the hallucinations in LVLMs, most are reference-based and depend on external tools, which complicates their practical application. To assess the viability of alternative methods, it is critical to understand whether the reference-free approaches, which do not rely on any external tools, can efficiently detect hallucinations. Therefore, we initiate an exploratory study to demonstrate the effectiveness of different reference-free solutions in detecting hallucinations in LVLMs. In particular, we conduct an extensive study on three kinds of techniques: uncertainty-based, consistency-based, and supervised uncertainty quantification methods on four representative LVLMs across two different tasks. The empirical results show that the reference-free approaches are capable of effectively detecting non-factual responses in LVLMs, with the supervised uncertainty quantification method outperforming the others, achieving the best performance across different settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05767v2,2024-08
VQ-CTAP: Cross-Modal Fine-Grained Sequence Representation Learning for Speech Processing,"Chunyu Qiang, Wang Geng, Yi Zhao, Ruibo Fu, Tao Wang, Cheng Gong, Tianrui Wang, Qiuyu Liu, Jiangyan Yi, Zhengqi Wen, Chen Zhang, Hao Che, Longbiao Wang, Jianwu Dang, Jianhua Tao","Deep learning has brought significant improvements to the field of cross-modal representation learning. For tasks such as text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), and automatic speech recognition (ASR), a cross-modal fine-grained (frame-level) sequence representation is desired, emphasizing the semantic content of the text modality while de-emphasizing the paralinguistic information of the speech modality. We propose a method called ""Vector Quantized Contrastive Token-Acoustic Pre-training (VQ-CTAP)"", which uses the cross-modal aligned sequence transcoder to bring text and speech into a joint multimodal space, learning how to connect text and speech at the frame level. The proposed VQ-CTAP is a paradigm for cross-modal sequence representation learning, offering a promising solution for fine-grained generation and recognition tasks in speech processing. The VQ-CTAP can be directly applied to VC and ASR tasks without fine-tuning or additional structures. We propose a sequence-aware semantic connector, which connects multiple frozen pre-trained modules for the TTS task, exhibiting a plug-and-play capability. We design a stepping optimization strategy to ensure effective model convergence by gradually injecting and adjusting the influence of various loss components. Furthermore, we propose a semantic-transfer-wise paralinguistic consistency loss to enhance representational capabilities, allowing the model to better generalize to unseen data and capture the nuances of paralinguistic information. In addition, VQ-CTAP achieves high-compression speech coding at a rate of 25Hz from 24kHz input waveforms, which is a 960-fold reduction in the sampling rate.

Language-Informed Beam Search Decoding for Multilingual Machine Translation,"Yilin Yang, Stefan Lee, Prasad Tadepalli","Beam search decoding is the de-facto method for decoding auto-regressive Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models, including multilingual NMT where the target language is specified as an input. However, decoding multilingual NMT models commonly produces ``off-target'' translations -- yielding translation outputs not in the intended language. In this paper, we first conduct an error analysis of off-target translations for a strong multilingual NMT model and identify how these decodings are produced during beam search. We then propose Language-informed Beam Search (LiBS), a general decoding algorithm incorporating an off-the-shelf Language Identification (LiD) model into beam search decoding to reduce off-target translations. LiBS is an inference-time procedure that is NMT-model agnostic and does not require any additional parallel data. Results show that our proposed LiBS algorithm on average improves +1.1 BLEU and +0.9 BLEU on WMT and OPUS datasets, and reduces off-target rates from 22.9\% to 7.7\% and 65.8\% to 25.3\% respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05738v1,2024-08
GPT-4 Emulates Average-Human Emotional Cognition from a Third-Person Perspective,"Ala N. Tak, Jonathan Gratch","This paper extends recent investigations on the emotional reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current research on LLMs has not directly evaluated the distinction between how LLMs predict the self-attribution of emotions and the perception of others' emotions. We first look at carefully crafted emotion-evoking stimuli, originally designed to find patterns of brain neural activity representing fine-grained inferred emotional attributions of others. We show that GPT-4 is especially accurate in reasoning about such stimuli. This suggests LLMs agree with humans' attributions of others' emotions in stereotypical scenarios remarkably more than self-attributions of emotions in idiosyncratic situations. To further explore this, our second study utilizes a dataset containing annotations from both the author and a third-person perspective. We find that GPT-4's interpretations align more closely with human judgments about the emotions of others than with self-assessments. Notably, conventional computational models of emotion primarily rely on self-reported ground truth as the gold standard. However, an average observer's standpoint, which LLMs appear to have adopted, might be more relevant for many downstream applications, at least in the absence of individual information and adequate safety considerations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13718v1,2024-08
Training an NLP Scholar at a Small Liberal Arts College: A Backwards Designed Course Proposal,"Grusha Prasad, Forrest Davis","The rapid growth in natural language processing (NLP) over the last couple years has generated student interest and excitement in learning more about the field. In this paper, we present two types of students that NLP courses might want to train. First, an ""NLP engineer"" who is able to flexibly design, build and apply new technologies in NLP for a wide range of tasks. Second, an ""NLP scholar"" who is able to pose, refine and answer questions in NLP and how it relates to the society, while also learning to effectively communicate these answers to a broader audience. While these two types of skills are not mutually exclusive -- NLP engineers should be able to think critically, and NLP scholars should be able to build systems -- we think that courses can differ in the balance of these skills. As educators at Small Liberal Arts Colleges, the strengths of our students and our institution favors an approach that is better suited to train NLP scholars. In this paper we articulate what kinds of skills an NLP scholar should have, and then adopt a backwards design to propose course components that can aid the acquisition of these skills.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05664v1,2024-08
WiDe-analysis: Enabling One-click Content Moderation Analysis on Wikipedia's Articles for Deletion,"Hsuvas Borkakoty, Luis Espinosa-Anke","Content moderation in online platforms is crucial for ensuring activity therein adheres to existing policies, especially as these platforms grow. NLP research in this area has typically focused on automating some part of it given that it is not feasible to monitor all active discussions effectively. Past works have focused on revealing deletion patterns with like sentiment analysis, or on developing platform-specific models such as Wikipedia policy or stance detectors. Unsurprisingly, however, this valuable body of work is rather scattered, with little to no agreement with regards to e.g., the deletion discussions corpora used for training or the number of stance labels. Moreover, while efforts have been made to connect stance with rationales (e.g., to ground a deletion decision on the relevant policy), there is little explanability work beyond that. In this paper, we introduce a suite of experiments on Wikipedia deletion discussions and wide-analyis (Wikipedia Deletion Analysis), a Python package aimed at providing one click analysis to content moderation discussions. We release all assets associated with wide-analysis, including data, models and the Python package, and a HuggingFace space with the goal to accelerate research on automating content moderation in Wikipedia and beyond.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05655v1,2024-08
Eigen Attention: Attention in Low-Rank Space for KV Cache Compression,"Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy","Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

Speculative Diffusion Decoding: Accelerating Language Generation through Diffusion,"Jacob K Christopher, Brian R Bartoldson, Tal Ben-Nun, Michael Cardei, Bhavya Kailkhura, Ferdinando Fioretto","Speculative decoding has emerged as a widely adopted method to accelerate large language model inference without sacrificing the quality of the model outputs. While this technique has facilitated notable speed improvements by enabling parallel sequence verification, its efficiency remains inherently limited by the reliance on incremental token generation in existing draft models. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an adaptation of speculative decoding which uses discrete diffusion models to generate draft sequences. This allows parallelization of both the drafting and verification steps, providing significant speed-ups to the inference process. Our proposed approach, Speculative Diffusion Decoding (SpecDiff), is validated on standard language generation benchmarks and empirically demonstrated to provide a up to 8.7x speed-up over standard generation processes and up to 2.5x speed-up over existing speculative decoding approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05636v3,2024-08
ViC: Virtual Compiler Is All You Need For Assembly Code Search,"Zeyu Gao, Hao Wang, Yuanda Wang, Chao Zhang","Assembly code search is vital for reducing the burden on reverse engineers, allowing them to quickly identify specific functions using natural language within vast binary programs. Despite its significance, this critical task is impeded by the complexities involved in building high-quality datasets. This paper explores training a Large Language Model (LLM) to emulate a general compiler. By leveraging Ubuntu packages to compile a dataset of 20 billion tokens, we further continue pre-train CodeLlama as a Virtual Compiler (ViC), capable of compiling any source code of any language to assembly code. This approach allows for virtual compilation across a wide range of programming languages without the need for a real compiler, preserving semantic equivalency and expanding the possibilities for assembly code dataset construction. Furthermore, we use ViC to construct a sufficiently large dataset for assembly code search. Employing this extensive dataset, we achieve a substantial improvement in assembly code search performance, with our model surpassing the leading baseline by 26%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06385v1,2024-08
Metacognitive Myopia in Large Language Models,"Florian Scholten, Tobias R. Rebholz, Mandy Hütter","Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potentially harmful biases that reinforce culturally inherent stereotypes, cloud moral judgments, or amplify positive evaluations of majority groups. Previous explanations mainly attributed bias in LLMs to human annotators and the selection of training data. Consequently, they have typically been addressed with bottom-up approaches such as reinforcement learning or debiasing corpora. However, these methods only treat the effects of LLM biases by indirectly influencing the model architecture, but do not address the underlying causes in the computational process. Here, we propose metacognitive myopia as a cognitive-ecological framework that can account for a conglomerate of established and emerging LLM biases and provide a lever to address problems in powerful but vulnerable tools. Our theoretical framework posits that a lack of the two components of metacognition, monitoring and control, causes five symptoms of metacognitive myopia in LLMs: integration of invalid tokens and embeddings, susceptibility to redundant information, neglect of base rates in conditional computation, decision rules based on frequency, and inappropriate higher-order statistical inference for nested data structures. As a result, LLMs produce erroneous output that reaches into the daily high-stakes decisions of humans. By introducing metacognitive regulatory processes into LLMs, engineers and scientists can develop precise remedies for the underlying causes of these biases. Our theory sheds new light on flawed human-machine interactions and raises ethical concerns regarding the increasing, imprudent implementation of LLMs in organizational structures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05568v1,2024-08
Document-Level Event Extraction with Definition-Driven ICL,"Zhuoyuan Liu, Yilin Luo","In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in document-level event extraction tasks, but existing methods face challenges in the design of prompts. To address this issue, we propose an optimization strategy called ""Definition-driven Document-level Event Extraction (DDEE)."" By adjusting the length of the prompt and enhancing the clarity of heuristics, we have significantly improved the event extraction performance of LLMs. We used data balancing techniques to solve the long-tail effect problem, enhancing the model's generalization ability for event types. At the same time, we refined the prompt to ensure it is both concise and comprehensive, adapting to the sensitivity of LLMs to the style of prompts. In addition, the introduction of structured heuristic methods and strict limiting conditions has improved the precision of event and argument role extraction. These strategies not only solve the prompt engineering problems of LLMs in document-level event extraction but also promote the development of event extraction technology, providing new research perspectives for other tasks in the NLP field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05566v1,2024-08
Large Language Model-based Role-Playing for Personalized Medical Jargon Extraction,"Jung Hoon Lim, Sunjae Kwon, Zonghai Yao, John P.

Tailoring medical notes to individual comprehension by identifying jargon that is difficult for each person will enhance the utility of generative models. We present the first quantitative analysis to measure the impact of role-playing in LLM in medical term extraction. By comparing the results of Mechanical Turk workers over 20 sentences, our study demonstrates that LLM role-playing improves F1 scores in 95% of cases across 14 different socio-demographic backgrounds. Furthermore, applying role-playing with in-context learning outperformed the previous state-of-the-art models.

Improving Whisper's Recognition Performance for Under-Represented Language Kazakh Leveraging Unpaired Speech and Text,"Jinpeng Li, Yu Pu, Qi Sun, Wei-Qiang Zhang","Whisper and other large-scale automatic speech recognition models have made significant progress in performance. However, their performance on many low-resource languages, such as Kazakh, is not satisfactory. It is worth researching how to utilize low-cost data to improve the performance of Whisper on under-represented languages. In this study, we utilized easily accessible unpaired speech and text data and combined the language model GPT with Whisper on Kazakh. We implemented end of transcript (EOT) judgment modification and hallucination penalty to improve the performance of speech recognition. Further, we employed the decoding average token log probability as a criterion to select samples from unlabeled speech data and used pseudo-labeled data to fine-tune the model to further improve its performance. Ultimately, we achieved more than 10\% absolute WER reduction in multiple experiments, and the whole process has the potential to be generalized to other under-represented languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05554v1,2024-08
Multi-layer Sequence Labeling-based Joint Biomedical Event Extraction,"Gongchi Chen, Pengchao Wu, Jinghang Gu, Longhua Qian, Guodong Zhou","In recent years, biomedical event extraction has been dominated by complicated pipeline and joint methods, which need to be simplified. In addition, existing work has not effectively utilized trigger word information explicitly. Hence, we propose MLSL, a method based on multi-layer sequence labeling for joint biomedical event extraction. MLSL does not introduce prior knowledge and complex structures. Moreover, it explicitly incorporates the information of candidate trigger words into the sequence labeling to learn the interaction relationships between trigger words and argument roles. Based on this, MLSL can learn well with just a simple workflow. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the superiority of MLSL in terms of extraction performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05545v2,2024-08

This paper introduces P3, an adaptive framework aimed at optimizing the task-specific fine-tuning process through iterative data pruning. P3 consists of three key components: (1) Policy-driven Difficulty Measurement, which dynamically assesses data difficulty based on the model's real-time performance, replacing static metrics with adaptable evaluations; (2) Pace-Adaptive Selection, leveraging self-paced learning to progressively introduce more challenging data, thereby enhancing model capability; (3) Diversity Promotion, incorporating Determinantal Point Process (DPP) to ensure data diversity across epochs, enriching the learning process.

By advancing dynamic data selection and utilization strategies, P3 contributes both a theoretical framework and concrete approach to fully exploit existing data for LLMs' performance improvement, offering utility across diverse tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05541v2,2024-08
Context-Driven Index Trimming: A Data Quality Perspective to Enhancing Precision of RALMs,"Kexin Ma, Ruochun Jin, Xi Wang, Huan Chen, Jing Ren, Yuhua Tang","Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RALMs) have made significant strides in enhancing the accuracy of generated responses.However, existing research often overlooks the data quality issues within retrieval results, often caused by inaccurate existing vector-distance-based retrieval methods.We propose to boost the precision of RALMs' answers from a data quality perspective through the Context-Driven Index Trimming (CDIT) framework, where Context Matching Dependencies (CMDs) are employed as logical data quality rules to capture and regulate the consistency between retrieved contexts.Based on the semantic comprehension capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), CDIT can effectively identify and discard retrieval results that are inconsistent with the query context and further modify indexes in the database, thereby improving answer quality.Experiments demonstrate on challenging question-answering tasks.Also, the flexibility of CDIT is verified through its compatibility with various language models and indexing methods, which offers a promising approach to bolster RALMs' data quality and retrieval precision jointly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05524v1,2024-08
SWIFT:A Scalable lightWeight Infrastructure for Fine-Tuning,"Yuze Zhao, Jintao Huang, Jinghan Hu, Xingjun Wang, Yunlin Mao, Daoze Zhang, Zeyinzi Jiang, Zhikai Wu, Baole Ai, Ang Wang, Wenmeng Zhou, Yingda Chen","Recent development in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have leverage Attention-based Transformer architectures and achieved superior performance and generalization capabilities. They have since covered extensive areas of traditional learning tasks. For instance, text-based tasks such as text-classification and sequence-labeling, as well as multi-modal tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which were previously addressed using different models, can now be tackled based on one foundation model. Consequently, the training and lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs and MLLMs, especially those based on Transformer architecture, has become particularly important. In recognition of these overwhelming needs, we develop SWIFT, a customizable one-stop infrastructure for large models. With support of over $300+$ LLMs and $50+$ MLLMs, SWIFT stands as the open-source framework that provide the most comprehensive support for fine-tuning large models. In particular, it is the first training framework that provides systematic support for MLLMs. In addition to the core functionalities of fine-tuning, SWIFT also integrates post-training processes such as inference, evaluation, and model quantization, to facilitate fast adoptions of large models in various application scenarios. With a systematic integration of various training techniques, SWIFT offers helpful utilities such as benchmark comparisons among different training techniques for large models. For fine-tuning models specialized in agent framework, we show that notable improvements on the ToolBench leader-board can be achieved by training with customized dataset on SWIFT, with an increase of 5.2%-21.8% in the Act.EM metric over various baseline models, a reduction in hallucination by 1.6%-14.1%, and an average performance improvement of 8%-17%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05517v3,2024-08
Your Context Is Not an Array: Unveiling Random Access Limitations in Transformers,"MohammadReza Ebrahimi, Sunny Panchal, Roland Memisevic","Despite their recent successes, Transformer-based large language models show surprising failure modes. A well-known example of such failure modes is their inability to length-generalize: solving problem instances at inference time that are longer than those seen during training. In this work, we further explore the root cause of this failure by performing a detailed analysis of model behaviors on the simple parity task. Our analysis suggests that length generalization failures are intricately related to a model's inability to perform random memory accesses within its context window. We present supporting evidence for this hypothesis by demonstrating the effectiveness of methodologies that circumvent the need for indexing or that enable random token access indirectly, through content-based addressing. We further show where and how the failure to perform random memory access manifests through attention map visualizations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05506v1,2024-08
GEM: Context-Aware Gaze EstiMation with Visual Search Behavior Matching for Chest Radiograph,"Shaonan Liu, Wenting Chen, Jie Liu, Xiaoling Luo, Linlin Shen","Gaze estimation is pivotal in human scene comprehension tasks, particularly in medical diagnostic analysis. Eye-tracking technology facilitates the recording of physicians' ocular movements during image interpretation, thereby elucidating their visual attention patterns and information-processing strategies. In this paper, we initially define the context-aware gaze estimation problem in medical radiology report settings. To understand the attention allocation and cognitive behavior of radiologists during the medical image interpretation process, we propose a context-aware Gaze EstiMation (GEM) network that utilizes eye gaze data collected from radiologists to simulate their visual search behavior patterns throughout the image interpretation process. It consists of a context-awareness module, visual behavior graph construction, and visual behavior matching. Within the context-awareness module, we achieve intricate multimodal registration by establishing connections between medical reports and images. Subsequently, for a more accurate simulation of genuine visual search behavior patterns, we introduce a visual behavior graph structure, capturing such behavior through high-order relationships (edges) between gaze points (nodes). To maintain the authenticity of visual behavior, we devise a visual behavior-matching approach, adjusting the high-order relationships between them by matching the graph constructed from real and estimated gaze points. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of GEM over existing methods and its strong generalizability, which also provides a new direction for the effective utilization of diverse modalities in medical image interpretation and enhances the interpretability of models in the field of medical imaging. https://github.com/Tiger-SN/GEM",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05502v1,2024-08
MABR: A Multilayer Adversarial Bias Removal Approach Without Prior Bias Knowledge,"Maxwell J. Yin, Boyu Wang, Charles Ling","Models trained on real-world data often mirror and exacerbate existing social biases. Traditional methods for mitigating these biases typically require prior knowledge of the specific biases to be addressed, such as gender or racial biases, and the social groups associated with each instance. In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial training strategy that operates independently of prior bias-type knowledge and protected attribute labels. Our approach proactively identifies biases during model training by utilizing auxiliary models, which are trained concurrently by predicting the performance of the main model without relying on task labels. Additionally, we implement these auxiliary models at various levels of the feature maps of the main model, enabling the detection of a broader and more nuanced range of bias features. Through experiments on racial and gender biases in sentiment and occupation classification tasks, our method effectively reduces social biases without the need for demographic annotations. Moreover, our approach not only matches but often surpasses the efficacy of methods that require detailed demographic insights, marking a significant advancement in bias mitigation techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05497v2,2024-08

Path-LLM: A Shortest-Path-based LLM Learning for Unified Graph Representation,"Wenbo Shang, Xuliang Zhu, Xin Huang","Unified graph representation learning aims to produce node embeddings, which can be applied to multiple downstream applications. However, existing studies based on graph neural networks and language models either suffer from the limitations of numerous training needed toward specific downstream predictions or have shallow semantic features. In this work, we propose a novel Path-LLM model to learn unified graph representation, which leverages a powerful large language model (LLM) to incorporate our proposed path features. Our Path-LLM framework consists of several well-designed techniques. First, we develop a new mechanism of long-to-short shortest path (L2SP) selection, which covers essential connections between different dense groups. An in-depth comparison of different path selection plans is offered to illustrate the strength of our designed L2SP. Then, we design path textualization to obtain L2SP-based training texts. Next, we feed the texts into a self-supervised LLM training process to learn embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the superiority of Path-LLM against the state-of-the-art WalkLM method on two classical graph learning tasks (node classification and link prediction) and one NP-hard graph query processing task (keyword search), meanwhile saving more than 90% of training paths.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05456v1,2024-08
Preserving Privacy in Large Language Models: A Survey on Current Threats and Solutions,"Michele Miranda, Elena Sofia Ruzzetti, Andrea Santilli, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto, Sébastien Bratières, Emanuele Rodolà","Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, finding applications across various domains.

This survey critically examines the privacy threats associated with LLMs, emphasizing the potential for these models to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information. We explore current threats by reviewing privacy attacks on LLMs and propose comprehensive solutions for integrating privacy mechanisms throughout the entire learning pipeline. These solutions range from anonymizing training datasets to implementing differential privacy during training or inference and machine unlearning after training.

"Chain of Condition: Construct, Verify and Solve Conditions for Conditional Question Answering","Jiuheng Lin, Yuxuan Lai, Yansong Feng","Conditional question answering (CQA) is an important task that aims to find probable answers and identify missing conditions. Existing approaches struggle with CQA due to two challenges: (1) precisely identifying necessary conditions and the logical relationship, and (2) verifying conditions to detect any that are missing. In this paper, we propose a novel prompting approach, Chain of condition, by first identifying all conditions and constructing their logical relationships explicitly according to the document, then verifying whether these conditions are satisfied, finally solving the logical expression to indicate any missing conditions and generating the answer accordingly. Experiments on two CQA benchmark datasets show our chain of condition outperforms existing prompting baselines, establishing a new state of the art. Furthermore, with only a few examples, our method can facilitate GPT-3.5-Turbo or GPT-4 to outperform all existing supervised models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05442v2,2024-08
LaiDA: Linguistics-aware In-context Learning with Data Augmentation for Metaphor Components Identification,"Hongde Liu, Chenyuan He, Feiyang Meng, Changyong Niu, Yuxiang Jia","Metaphor Components Identification (MCI) contributes to enhancing machine understanding of metaphors, thereby advancing downstream natural language processing tasks. However, the complexity, diversity, and dependency on context and background knowledge pose significant challenges for MCI. Large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for accurate comprehension of complex natural language texts due to their strong semantic analysis and extensive commonsense knowledge. In this research, a new LLM-based framework is proposed, named Linguistics-aware In-context Learning with Data Augmentation (LaiDA). Specifically, ChatGPT and supervised fine-tuning are utilized to tailor a high-quality dataset. LaiDA incorporates a simile dataset for pre-training. A graph attention network encoder generates linguistically rich feature representations to retrieve similar examples. Subsequently, LLM is fine-tuned with prompts that integrate linguistically similar examples. LaiDA ranked 2nd in Subtask 2 of NLPCC2024 Shared Task 9, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Text classification optimization algorithm based on graph neural network,"Erdi Gao, Haowei Yang, Dan Sun, Haohao Xia, Yuhan Ma, Yuanjing Zhu","In the field of natural language processing, text classification, as a basic task, has important research value and application prospects. Traditional text classification methods usually rely on feature representations such as the bag of words model or TF-IDF, which overlook the semantic connections between words and make it challenging to grasp the deep structural details of the text. Recently, GNNs have proven to be a valuable asset for text classification tasks, thanks to their capability to handle non-Euclidean data efficiently. However, the existing text classification methods based on GNN still face challenges such as complex graph structure construction and high cost of model training. This paper introduces a text classification optimization algorithm utilizing graph neural networks. By introducing adaptive graph construction strategy and efficient graph convolution operation, the accuracy and efficiency of text classification are effectively improved. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses traditional approaches and existing GNN models across multiple public datasets, highlighting its superior performance and feasibility for text classification tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15257v1,2024-08
FiSTECH: Financial Style Transfer to Enhance Creativity without Hallucinations in LLMs,"Sohini Roychowdhury, Marko Krema, Brian Moore, Xingjian Lai, Dike Effedua, Bharat Jethwani","Recent trends in Generative AI have emerged towards fine-tuning foundational large language models (LLMs) to create domain-specific LLMs for automation and chatbot-like applications. Specialized applications for analytics-heavy domains such as Financial report generation require specific writing styles that comprise compound and creative sentences with minimized hallucinations. In this work, we explore the self-corrective auto-regressive qualities of LLMs to learn creativity in writing styles with minimal prompting. We propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning (FT) strategy wherein in the first stage public domain financial reports are used to train for writing styles while allowing the LLM to hallucinate. In the second stage the examples of hallucinations are manually corrected and further used to fine-tune the LLM. The finally trained LLM learns to generate specific financial report sections using minimal instructions and tabular data inputs while ensuring low fine-tuning costs. Our proposed two-stage fine-tuning boosts the accuracy of financial questions answering by two-folds while reducing hallucinations by over 50%. Also, the fine-tuned model has lower perplexity, improved ROUGE, TER and BLEU scores, higher creativity and knowledge density with lower uncertainty and cross entropy than base LLMs. Thus, the proposed framework can be generalized to train creativity in LLMs by first allowing them to hallucinate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05365v4,2024-08
LLaMA based Punctuation Restoration With Forward Pass Only Decoding,"Yutong Pang, Debjyoti Paul, Kevin Jiang, Xuedong Zhang, Xin Lei","This paper introduces two advancements in the field of Large Language Model Annotation with a focus on punctuation restoration tasks. Our first contribution is the application of LLaMA for punctuation restoration, which demonstrates superior performance compared to the established benchmark.   Despite its impressive quality, LLaMA faces challenges regarding inference speed and hallucinations. To address this, our second contribution presents Forward Pass Only Decoding (FPOD), a novel decoding approach for annotation tasks. This innovative method results in a substantial 19.8x improvement in inference speed, effectively addressing a critical bottleneck and enhancing the practical utility of LLaMA for large-scale data annotation tasks without hallucinations.

DataNarrative: Automated Data-Driven Storytelling with Visualizations and Texts,"Mohammed Saidul Islam, Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Md Rizwan Parvez, Enamul Hoque, Shafiq Joty","Data-driven storytelling is a powerful method for conveying insights by combining narrative techniques with visualizations and text. These stories integrate visual aids, such as highlighted bars and lines in charts, along with textual annotations explaining insights. However, creating such stories requires a deep understanding of the data and meticulous narrative planning, often necessitating human intervention, which can be time-consuming and mentally taxing. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various NLP tasks, their ability to generate coherent and comprehensive data stories remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel task for data story generation and a benchmark containing 1,449 stories from diverse sources. To address the challenges of crafting coherent data stories, we propose a multiagent framework employing two LLM agents designed to replicate the human storytelling process: one for understanding and describing the data (Reflection), generating the outline, and narration, and another for verification at each intermediary step. While our agentic framework generally outperforms non-agentic counterparts in both model-based and human evaluations, the results also reveal unique challenges in data story generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05346v3,2024-08
Revisiting Multi-Modal LLM Evaluation,"Jian Lu, Shikhar Srivastava, Junyu Chen, Robik Shrestha, Manoj Acharya, Kushal Kafle, Christopher Kanan","With the advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), datasets used for visual question answering (VQA) and referring expression comprehension have seen a resurgence. However, the most popular datasets used to evaluate MLLMs are some of the earliest ones created, and they have many known problems, including extreme bias, spurious correlations, and an inability to permit fine-grained analysis. In this paper, we pioneer evaluating recent MLLMs (LLaVA 1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, GPT-4V, and GPT-4o) on datasets designed to address weaknesses in earlier ones. We assess three VQA datasets: 1) TDIUC, which permits fine-grained analysis on 12 question types; 2) TallyQA, which has simple and complex counting questions; and 3) DVQA, which requires optical character recognition for chart understanding. We also study VQDv1, a dataset that requires identifying all image regions that satisfy a given query. Our experiments reveal the weaknesses of many MLLMs that have not previously been reported. Our code is integrated into the widely used LAVIS framework for MLLM evaluation, enabling the rapid assessment of future MLLMs. Project webpage: https://kevinlujian.github.io/MLLM_Evaluations/",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05334v1,2024-08
From Text to Insight: Leveraging Large Language Models for Performance Evaluation in Management,"Ning Li, Huaikang Zhou, Mingze Xu","This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to enhance objectivity in organizational task performance evaluations. Through comparative analyses across two studies, including various task performance outputs, we demonstrate that LLMs can serve as a reliable and even superior alternative to human raters in evaluating knowledge-based performance outputs, which are a key contribution of knowledge workers. Our results suggest that GPT ratings are comparable to human ratings but exhibit higher consistency and reliability. Additionally, combined multiple GPT ratings on the same performance output show strong correlations with aggregated human performance ratings, akin to the consensus principle observed in performance evaluation literature. However, we also find that LLMs are prone to contextual biases, such as the halo effect, mirroring human evaluative biases. Our research suggests that while LLMs are capable of extracting meaningful constructs from text-based data, their scope is currently limited to specific forms of performance evaluation. By highlighting both the potential and limitations of LLMs, our study contributes to the discourse on AI role in management studies and sets a foundation for future research to refine AI theoretical and practical applications in management.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05328v1,2024-08
A Psychology-based Unified Dynamic Framework for Curriculum Learning,"Guangyu Meng, Qingkai Zeng, John P. Lalor, Hong Yu","Directly learning from examples of random difficulty levels is often challenging for both humans and machine learning models. A more effective strategy involves exposing learners to examples in a progressive order, from easy to difficult. Curriculum Learning (CL) has been proposed to implement this strategy in machine learning model training. However, two key challenges persist in CL framework design: defining the difficulty of training data and determining the appropriate amount of data to input at each training step. This paper presents a Psychology-based Unified Dynamic Framework for Curriculum Learning (PUDF), drawing inspiration from psychometrics. We quantify the difficulty of training data by applying Item Response Theory (IRT) to responses from Artificial Crowds (AC). This theory-driven IRT-AC approach leads to global (i.e., model-independent) and interpretable difficulty values. Leveraging IRT, we propose a Dynamic Data Selection via Model Ability Estimation (DDS-MAE) strategy to schedule the appropriate amount of data during model training. Since our difficulty labeling and model ability estimation are based on a consistent theory, namely IRT, their values are comparable within the same scope, potentially leading to a faster convergence compared to the other CL methods. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained language models with PUDF enhances their performance on the GLUE benchmark. Moreover, PUDF surpasses other state-of-the-art (SOTA) CL methods on the GLUE benchmark. We further explore the components of PUDF, namely the difficulty measurer (IRT-AC) and the training scheduler (DDS-MAE) qualitatively and quantitatively. Lastly, we conduct an ablation study to clarify which components of PUDF contribute to faster convergence and higher accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05326v1,2024-08
"MUSE: Multi-Knowledge Passing on the Edges, Boosting Knowledge Graph Completion",Pengjie Liu,"Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to predict the missing information in the (head entity)-[relation]-(tail entity) triplet. Deep Neural Networks have achieved significant progress in the relation prediction task. However, most existing KGC methods focus on single features (e.g., entity IDs) and sub-graph aggregation, which cannot fully explore all the features in the Knowledge Graph (KG), and neglect the external semantic knowledge injection. To address these problems, we propose MUSE, a knowledge-aware reasoning model to learn a tailored embedding space in three dimensions for missing relation prediction through a multi-knowledge representation learning mechanism. Our MUSE consists of three parallel components: 1) Prior Knowledge Learning for enhancing the triplets' semantic representation by fine-tuning BERT; 2) Context Message Passing for enhancing the context messages of KG; 3) Relational Path Aggregation for enhancing the path representation from the head entity to the tail entity. Our experimental results show that MUSE significantly outperforms other baselines on four public datasets, such as over 5.50% improvement in H@1 and 4.20% improvement in MRR on the NELL995 dataset.

In this paper, we introduce VITA, the first-ever open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at simultaneous processing and analysis of Video, Image, Text, and Audio modalities, and meanwhile has an advanced multimodal interactive experience. Starting from Mixtral 8x7B as a language foundation, we expand its Chinese vocabulary followed by bilingual instruction tuning. We further endow the language model with visual and audio capabilities through two-stage multi-task learning of multimodal alignment and instruction tuning. VITA demonstrates robust foundational capabilities of multilingual, vision, and audio understanding, as evidenced by its strong performance across a range of both unimodal and multimodal benchmarks. Beyond foundational capabilities, we have made considerable progress in enhancing the natural multimodal human-computer interaction experience. VITA is the first step for the open-source community to explore the seamless integration of multimodal understanding and interaction.

Evaluating the capability of large language models to personalize science texts for diverse middle-school-age learners,"Michael Vaccaro Jr, Mikayla Friday, Arash Zaghi","Large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's GPT-series, have made significant advancements in recent years. Known for their expertise across diverse subject areas and quick adaptability to user-provided prompts, LLMs hold unique potential as Personalized Learning (PL) tools. Despite this potential, their application in K-12 education remains largely unexplored. This paper presents one of the first randomized controlled trials (n = 23) to evaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 in personalizing educational science texts for middle school students. In this study, GPT-4 was used to profile student learning preferences based on choices made during a training session. For the experimental group, GPT-4 was used to rewrite science texts to align with the student's predicted profile while, for students in the control group, texts were rewritten to contradict their learning preferences. The results of a Mann-Whitney U test showed that students significantly preferred (at the .10 level) the rewritten texts when they were aligned with their profile (p = .059). These findings suggest that GPT-4 can effectively interpret and tailor educational content to diverse learner preferences, marking a significant advancement in PL technology. The limitations of this study and ethical considerations for using artificial intelligence in education are also discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05204v1,2024-08
KlF: Knowledge Localization and Fusion for Language Model Continual Learning,"Yujie Feng, Xu Chu, Yongxin Xu, Zexin Lu, Bo Liu, Philip S. Yu, Xiao-Ming Wu","Language model continual learning (CL) has recently attracted significant interest for its ability to adapt large language models (LLMs) to dynamic real-world scenarios without retraining. A major challenge in this domain is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new tasks. Existing approaches commonly utilize multiple parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific knowledge, yet these methods are inefficient and fail to leverage potential knowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel CL framework for language models, named Knowledge Localization and Fusion (KlF), which boosts knowledge transfer without depending on memory replay. KlF initially segregates the model into 'skill units' based on parameter dependencies, allowing for more precise control. Subsequently, it employs a novel group-wise knowledge localization technique to ascertain the importance distribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance distribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained knowledge fusion strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing forgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional knowledge transfer. As a result, KlF achieves an optimal balance between retaining prior knowledge and excelling in new tasks. KlF also demonstrates strong generalizability, making it suitable for various base models and adaptable to PEFT methods like LoRA. Furthermore, it offers notable extensibility, supporting enhancements through integration with memory replay techniques. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two CL benchmarks, involving models ranging from 220M to 7B parameters, affirm the effectiveness of KlF and its variants across different settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05200v3,2024-08
Separating Style from Substance: Enhancing Cross-Genre Authorship Attribution through Data Selection and Presentation,"Steven Fincke, Elizabeth Boschee","The task of deciding whether two documents are written by the same author is challenging for both machines and humans. This task is even more challenging when the two documents are written about different topics (e.g. baseball vs. politics) or in different genres (e.g. a blog post vs. an academic article). For machines, the problem is complicated by the relative lack of real-world training examples that cross the topic boundary and the vanishing scarcity of cross-genre data. We propose targeted methods for training data selection and a novel learning curriculum that are designed to discourage a model's reliance on topic information for authorship attribution and correspondingly force it to incorporate information more robustly indicative of style no matter the topic. These refinements yield a 62.7% relative improvement in average cross-genre authorship attribution, as well as 16.6% in the per-genre condition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05192v1,2024-08

Node Level Graph Autoencoder: Unified Pretraining for Textual Graph Learning,"Wenbin Hu, Huihao Jing, Qi Hu, Haoran Li, Yangqiu Song","Textual graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, featuring rich text information with complex relationships, which enables advanced research across various fields. Textual graph representation learning aims to generate low-dimensional feature embeddings from textual graphs that can improve the performance of downstream tasks. A high-quality feature embedding should effectively capture both the structural and the textual information in a textual graph. However, most textual graph dataset benchmarks rely on word2vec techniques to generate feature embeddings, which inherently limits their capabilities. Recent works on textual graph representation learning can be categorized into two folds: supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods finetune a language model on labeled nodes, which have limited capabilities when labeled data is scarce. Unsupervised methods, on the other hand, extract feature embeddings by developing complex training pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified unsupervised learning autoencoder framework, named Node Level Graph AutoEncoder (NodeGAE). We employ language models as the backbone of the autoencoder, with pretraining on text reconstruction. Additionally, we add an auxiliary loss term to make the feature embeddings aware of the local graph structure. Our method maintains simplicity in the training process and demonstrates generalizability across diverse textual graphs and downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on two core graph representation learning downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of diverse graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple textual graph datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07091v2,2024-08
How Well Do LLMs Identify Cultural Unity in Diversity?,"Jialin Li, Junli Wang, Junjie Hu, Ming Jiang","Much work on the cultural awareness of large language models (LLMs) focuses on the models' sensitivity to geo-cultural diversity. However, in addition to cross-cultural differences, there also exists common ground across cultures. For instance, a bridal veil in the United States plays a similar cultural-relevant role as a honggaitou in China. In this study, we introduce a benchmark dataset CUNIT for evaluating decoder-only LLMs in understanding the cultural unity of concepts. Specifically, CUNIT consists of 1,425 evaluation examples building upon 285 traditional cultural-specific concepts across 10 countries. Based on a systematic manual annotation of cultural-relevant features per concept, we calculate the cultural association between any pair of cross-cultural concepts. Built upon this dataset, we design a contrastive matching task to evaluate the LLMs' capability to identify highly associated cross-cultural concept pairs. We evaluate 3 strong LLMs, using 3 popular prompting strategies, under the settings of either giving all extracted concept features or no features at all on CUNIT Interestingly, we find that cultural associations across countries regarding clothing concepts largely differ from food. Our analysis shows that LLMs are still limited to capturing cross-cultural associations between concepts compared to humans. Moreover, geo-cultural proximity shows a weak influence on model performance in capturing cross-cultural associations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05102v1,2024-08

Unlocking Decoding-time Controllability: Gradient-Free Multi-Objective Alignment with Contrastive Prompts,"Tingchen Fu, Yupeng Hou, Julian McAuley, Rui Yan","The task of multi-objective alignment aims at balancing and controlling the different alignment objectives (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness and honesty) of large language models to meet the personalized requirements of different users. However, previous methods tend to train multiple models to deal with various user preferences, with the number of trained models growing linearly with the number of alignment objectives and the number of different preferences. Meanwhile, existing methods are generally poor in extensibility and require significant re-training for each new alignment objective considered. Considering the limitation of previous approaches, we propose MCA (Multi-objective Contrastive Alignemnt), which constructs an expert prompt and an adversarial prompt for each objective to contrast at the decoding time and balances the objectives through combining the contrast. Our approach is verified to be superior to previous methods in obtaining a well-distributed Pareto front among different alignment objectives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05094v1,2024-08
Order Matters in Hallucination: Reasoning Order as Benchmark and Reflexive Prompting for Large-Language-Models,Zikai Xie,"Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the ""hallucination problem"", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that ""9.11$>$9.9"". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05093v3,2024-08
Generating novel experimental hypotheses from language models: A case study on cross-dative generalization,"Kanishka Misra, Najoung Kim","Neural network language models (LMs) have been shown to successfully capture complex linguistic knowledge. However, their utility for understanding language acquisition is still debated. We contribute to this debate by presenting a case study where we use LMs as simulated learners to derive novel experimental hypotheses to be tested with humans. We apply this paradigm to study cross-dative generalization (CDG): productive generalization of novel verbs across dative constructions (she pilked me the ball/she pilked the ball to me)--acquisition of which is known to involve a large space of contextual features--using LMs trained on child-directed speech. We specifically ask: ""what properties of the training exposure facilitate a novel verb's generalization to the (unmodeled) alternate construction?"" To answer this, we systematically vary the exposure context in which a novel dative verb occurs in terms of the properties of the theme and recipient, and then analyze the LMs' usage of the novel verb in the unmodeled dative construction. We find LMs to replicate known patterns of children's CDG, as a precondition to exploring novel hypotheses. Subsequent simulations reveal a nuanced role of the features of the novel verbs' exposure context on the LMs' CDG. We find CDG to be facilitated when the first postverbal argument of the exposure context is pronominal, definite, short, and conforms to the prototypical animacy expectations of the exposure dative. These patterns are characteristic of harmonic alignment in datives, where the argument with features ranking higher on the discourse prominence scale tends to precede the other. This gives rise to a novel hypothesis that CDG is facilitated insofar as the features of the exposure context--in particular, its first postverbal argument--are harmonically aligned. We conclude by proposing future experiments that can test this hypothesis in children.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05086v2,2024-08

Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features improved the concordance index from 0.779 to 0.842 during external validation, demonstrating a significant performance enhancement. Key LLM-structured features, such as disease extent, general condition, and RT purpose, showed high predictive importance and aligned closely with statistically significant predictors identified through conventional statistical analyses, thereby improving model interpretability. Furthermore, the framework enhanced risk stratification, enabling more distinct differentiation among low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups (p < 0.001) using LLM-structured clinical features.

In the context of large language models (LLMs), these data lend themselves nicely to comparing different groups of humans with AI, as we can have access to human and machine answer distributions. We leverage these characteristics of the ENEM dataset and compare GPT-3.5 and 4, and MariTalk, a model trained using Portuguese data, to humans, aiming to ascertain how their answers relate to real societal groups and what that may reveal about the model biases. We divide the human groups by using socioeconomic status (SES), and compare their answer distribution with LLMs for each question and for the essay. We find no significant biases when comparing LLM performance to humans on the multiple-choice Brazilian Portuguese tests, as the distance between model and human answers is mostly determined by the human accuracy. A similar conclusion is found by looking at the generated text as, when analyzing the essays, we observe that human and LLM essays differ in a few key factors, one being the choice of words where model essays were easily separable from human ones. The texts also differ syntactically, with LLM generated essays exhibiting, on average, smaller sentences and less thought units, among other differences. These results suggest that, for Brazilian Portuguese in the ENEM context, LLM outputs represent no group of humans, being significantly different from the answers from Brazilian students across all tests.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05035v1,2024-08
MIDI-to-Tab: Guitar Tablature Inference via Masked Language Modeling,"Drew Edwards, Xavier Riley, Pedro Sarmento, Simon Dixon","Guitar tablatures enrich the structure of traditional music notation by assigning each note to a string and fret of a guitar in a particular tuning, indicating precisely where to play the note on the instrument. The problem of generating tablature from a symbolic music representation involves inferring this string and fret assignment per note across an entire composition or performance. On the guitar, multiple string-fret assignments are possible for most pitches, which leads to a large combinatorial space that prevents exhaustive search approaches. Most modern methods use constraint-based dynamic programming to minimize some cost function (e.g.\ hand position movement). In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning solution to symbolic guitar tablature estimation. We train an encoder-decoder Transformer model in a masked language modeling paradigm to assign notes to strings. The model is first pre-trained on DadaGP, a dataset of over 25K tablatures, and then fine-tuned on a curated set of professionally transcribed guitar performances. Given the subjective nature of assessing tablature quality, we conduct a user study amongst guitarists, wherein we ask participants to rate the playability of multiple versions of tablature for the same four-bar excerpt. The results indicate our system significantly outperforms competing algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05024v1,2024-08
Investigating a Benchmark for Training-set free Evaluation of Linguistic Capabilities in Machine Reading Comprehension,"Viktor Schlegel, Goran Nenadic, Riza Batista-Navarro","Performance of NLP systems is typically evaluated by collecting a large-scale dataset by means of crowd-sourcing to train a data-driven model and evaluate it on a held-out portion of the data. This approach has been shown to suffer from spurious correlations and the lack of challenging examples that represent the diversity of natural language. Instead, we examine a framework for evaluating optimised models in training-set free setting on synthetically generated challenge sets. We find that despite the simplicity of the generation method, the data can compete with crowd-sourced datasets with regard to naturalness and lexical diversity for the purpose of evaluating the linguistic capabilities of MRC models. We conduct further experiments and show that state-of-the-art language model-based MRC systems can learn to succeed on the challenge set correctly, although, without capturing the general notion of the evaluated phenomenon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05023v1,2024-08
Tabular Transfer Learning via Prompting LLMs,"Jaehyun Nam, Woomin Song, Seong Hyeon Park, Jihoon Tack, Sukmin Yun, Jaehyung Kim, Kyu Hwan Oh, Jinwoo Shin","Learning with a limited number of labeled data is a central problem in real-world applications of machine learning, as it is often expensive to obtain annotations. To deal with the scarcity of labeled data, transfer learning is a conventional approach; it suggests to learn a transferable knowledge by training a neural network from multiple other sources. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning of tabular tasks, which has been less studied and successful in the literature, compared to other domains, e.g., vision and language. This is because tables are inherently heterogeneous, i.e., they contain different columns and feature spaces, making transfer learning difficult. On the other hand, recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the label scarcity issue can be mitigated by utilizing in-context learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this and the fact that LLMs can also process tables within a unified language space, we ask whether LLMs can be effective for tabular transfer learning, in particular, under the scenarios where the source and target datasets are of different format. As a positive answer, we propose a novel tabular transfer learning framework, coined Prompt to Transfer (P2T), that utilizes unlabeled (or heterogeneous) source data with LLMs. Specifically, P2T identifies a column feature in a source dataset that is strongly correlated with a target task feature to create examples relevant to the target task, thus creating pseudo-demonstrations for prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that P2T outperforms previous methods on various tabular learning benchmarks, showing good promise for the important, yet underexplored tabular transfer learning problem. Code is available at https://github.com/jaehyun513/P2T.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11063v1,2024-08
ProFuser: Progressive Fusion of Large Language Models,"Tianyuan Shi, Fanqi Wan, Canbin Huang, Xiaojun Quan, Chenliang Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang","While fusing the capacities and advantages of various large language models (LLMs) offers a pathway to construct more powerful and versatile models, a fundamental challenge is to properly select advantageous model during the training. Existing fusion methods primarily focus on the training mode that uses cross entropy on ground truth in a teacher-forcing setup to measure a model's advantage, which may provide limited insight towards model advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that enhances the fusion process by incorporating both the training and inference modes. Our method evaluates model advantage not only through cross entropy during training but also by considering inference outputs, providing a more comprehensive assessment. To combine the two modes effectively, we introduce ProFuser to progressively transition from inference mode to training mode. To validate ProFuser's effectiveness, we fused three models, including vicuna-7b-v1.5, Llama-2-7b-chat, and mpt-7b-8k-chat, and demonstrated the improved performance in knowledge, reasoning, and safety compared to baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04998v1,2024-08
Get Confused Cautiously: Textual Sequence Memorization Erasure with Selective Entropy Maximization,"Zhaohan Zhang, Ziquan Liu, Ioannis Patras","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to memorize and recite some of the textual sequences from their training set verbatim, raising broad concerns about privacy and copyright issues when using LLMs. This Textual Sequence Memorization (TSM) phenomenon leads to a high demand to regulate LLM output to prevent it from generating certain memorized text to meet user requirements. However, our empirical study reveals that existing methods for TSM erasure fail to forget massive memorized samples without substantially jeopardizing the model utility. To achieve a better trade-off between the effectiveness of TSM erasure and model utility in LLMs, our paper proposes a new framework based on Entropy Maximization with Selective Optimization (EMSO), where the updated weights are chosen with a novel contrastive gradient metric without any participation of additional model or data. Our analysis shows that training with the entropy maximization loss has a more stable optimization process and better keeps model utility than existing methods. The contrastive gradient metric localizes the most influential weight for TSM erasure by taking both the gradient magnitude and direction into consideration. Extensive experiments across three model scales demonstrate that our method excels in handling large-scale forgetting requests while preserving model ability in language generation and reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04983v1,2024-08
reCSE: Portable Reshaping Features for Sentence Embedding in Self-supervised Contrastive Learning,"Fufangchen Zhao, Jian Gao, Danfeng Yan","We propose reCSE, a self supervised contrastive learning sentence representation framework based on feature reshaping. This framework is different from the current advanced models that use discrete data augmentation methods, but instead reshapes the input features of the original sentence, aggregates the global information of each token in the sentence, and alleviates the common problems of representation polarity and GPU memory consumption linear increase in current advanced models. In addition, our reCSE has achieved competitive performance in semantic similarity tasks. And the experiment proves that our proposed feature reshaping method has strong universality, which can be transplanted to other self supervised contrastive learning frameworks and enhance their representation ability, even achieving state-of-the-art performance.

"Generalisation First, Memorisation Second? Memorisation Localisation for Natural Language Classification Tasks","Verna Dankers, Ivan Titov","Memorisation is a natural part of learning from real-world data: neural models pick up on atypical input-output combinations and store those training examples in their parameter space. That this happens is well-known, but how and where are questions that remain largely unanswered. Given a multi-layered neural model, where does memorisation occur in the millions of parameters? Related work reports conflicting findings: a dominant hypothesis based on image classification is that lower layers learn generalisable features and that deeper layers specialise and memorise. Work from NLP suggests this does not apply to language models, but has been mainly focused on memorisation of facts. We expand the scope of the localisation question to 12 natural language classification tasks and apply 4 memorisation localisation techniques. Our results indicate that memorisation is a gradual process rather than a localised one, establish that memorisation is task-dependent, and give nuance to the generalisation first, memorisation second hypothesis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04965v1,2024-08
HybridRAG: Integrating Knowledge Graphs and Vector Retrieval Augmented Generation for Efficient Information Extraction,"Bhaskarjit Sarmah, Benika Hall, Rohan Rao, Sunil Patel, Stefano Pasquali, Dhagash Mehta","Extraction and interpretation of intricate information from unstructured text data arising in financial applications, such as earnings call transcripts, present substantial challenges to large language models (LLMs) even using the current best practices to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (referred to as VectorRAG techniques which utilize vector databases for information retrieval) due to challenges such as domain specific terminology and complex formats of the documents. We introduce a novel approach based on a combination, called HybridRAG, of the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) based RAG techniques (called GraphRAG) and VectorRAG techniques to enhance question-answer (Q&A) systems for information extraction from financial documents that is shown to be capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant answers. Using experiments on a set of financial earning call transcripts documents which come in the form of Q&A format, and hence provide a natural set of pairs of ground-truth Q&As, we show that HybridRAG which retrieves context from both vector database and KG outperforms both traditional VectorRAG and GraphRAG individually when evaluated at both the retrieval and generation stages in terms of retrieval accuracy and answer generation. The proposed technique has applications beyond the financial domain",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04948v1,2024-08
Quantitative Information Extraction from Humanitarian Documents,"Daniele Liberatore, Kyriaki Kalimeri, Derya Sever, Yelena Mejova","Humanitarian action is accompanied by a mass of reports, summaries, news, and other documents. To guide its activities, important information must be quickly extracted from such free-text resources. Quantities, such as the number of people affected, amount of aid distributed, or the extent of infrastructure damage, are central to emergency response and anticipatory action. In this work, we contribute an annotated dataset for the humanitarian domain for the extraction of such quantitative information, along side its important context, including units it refers to, any modifiers, and the relevant event. Further, we develop a custom Natural Language Processing pipeline to extract the quantities alongside their units, and evaluate it in comparison to baseline and recent literature. The proposed model achieves a consistent improvement in the performance, especially in the documents pertaining to the Dominican Republic and select African countries. We make the dataset and code available to the research community to continue the improvement of NLP tools for the humanitarian domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04941v1,2024-08
Interactive-T2S: Multi-Turn Interactions for Text-to-SQL with Large Language Models,"Guanming Xiong, Junwei Bao, Hongfei Jiang, Yang Song, Wen Zhao","This study explores text-to-SQL parsing by leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite recent advancements, existing LLM-based methods have not adequately addressed scalability, leading to inefficiencies when processing wide tables. Furthermore, current interaction-based approaches either lack a step-by-step, interpretable SQL generation process or fail to provide an efficient and universally applicable interaction design. To address these challenges, we introduce Interactive-T2S, a framework that generates SQL queries through direct interactions with databases. This framework includes four general tools that facilitate proactive and efficient information retrieval by the LLM. Additionally, we have developed detailed exemplars to demonstrate the step-wise reasoning processes within our framework. Our experiments on the BIRD-Dev dataset, employing a setting without oracle knowledge, reveal that our method achieves state-of-the-art results with only two exemplars, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11062v1,2024-08
Surveying the Landscape of Image Captioning Evaluation: A Comprehensive Taxonomy and Novel Ensemble Method,"Uri Berger, Gabriel Stanovsky, Omri Abend, Lea Frermann","The task of image captioning has recently been gaining popularity, and with it the complex task of evaluating the quality of image captioning models. In this work, we present the first survey and taxonomy of over 70 different image captioning metrics and their usage in hundreds of papers. We find that despite the diversity of proposed metrics, the vast majority of studies rely on only five popular metrics, which we show to be weakly correlated with human judgements. Instead, we propose EnsembEval -- an ensemble of evaluation methods achieving the highest reported correlation with human judgements across 5 image captioning datasets, showing there is a lot of room for improvement by leveraging a diverse set of metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04909v1,2024-08
Towards a Generative Approach for Emotion Detection and Reasoning,"Ankita Bhaumik, Tomek Strzalkowski","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques. But can they perform emotional reasoning by concatenating `Let's think step-by-step' to the input prompt? In this paper we investigate this question along with introducing a novel approach to zero-shot emotion detection and emotional reasoning using LLMs. Existing state of the art zero-shot approaches rely on textual entailment models to choose the most appropriate emotion label for an input text. We argue that this strongly restricts the model to a fixed set of labels which may not be suitable or sufficient for many applications where emotion analysis is required. Instead, we propose framing the problem of emotion analysis as a generative question-answering (QA) task. Our approach uses a two step methodology of generating relevant context or background knowledge to answer the emotion detection question step-by-step. Our paper is the first work on using a generative approach to jointly address the tasks of emotion detection and emotional reasoning for texts. We evaluate our approach on two popular emotion detection datasets and also release the fine-grained emotion labels and explanations for further training and fine-tuning of emotional reasoning systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04906v1,2024-08
GlitchProber: Advancing Effective Detection and Mitigation of Glitch Tokens in Large Language Models,"Zhibo Zhang, Wuxia Bai, Yuxi Li, Mark Huasong Meng, Kailong Wang, Ling Shi, Li Li, Jun Wang, Haoyu Wang","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in the field of natural language processing. However, the black-box nature of their internal mechanisms has brought many concerns about their trustworthiness and interpretability. Recent research has discovered a class of abnormal tokens in the model's vocabulary space and named them ""glitch tokens"". Those tokens, once included in the input, may induce the model to produce incorrect, irrelevant, or even harmful results, drastically undermining the reliability and practicality of LLMs.   In this work, we aim to enhance the understanding of glitch tokens and propose techniques for their detection and mitigation. We first reveal the characteristic features induced by glitch tokens on LLMs, which are evidenced by significant deviations in the distributions of attention patterns and dynamic information from intermediate model layers. Based on the insights, we develop GlitchProber, a tool for efficient glitch token detection and mitigation. GlitchProber utilizes small-scale sampling, principal component analysis for accelerated feature extraction, and a simple classifier for efficient vocabulary screening. Taking one step further, GlitchProber rectifies abnormal model intermediate layer values to mitigate the destructive effects of glitch tokens. Evaluated on five mainstream open-source LLMs, GlitchProber demonstrates higher efficiency, precision, and recall compared to existing approaches, with an average F1 score of 0.86 and an average repair rate of 50.06%. GlitchProber unveils a novel path to address the challenges posed by glitch tokens and inspires future research toward more robust and interpretable LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04905v2,2024-08

Our contributions are threefold: (1) creating Codenames players using contrastive learning of an embedding space and LLM prompting that are aligned with human patterns of play, (2) studying culturally induced differences in common ground reflected in our trained models, and (3) demonstrating that our method RSA+C3 can ease cross-cultural communication in gameplay by inferring sociocultural context from interaction.

Unsupervised Episode Detection for Large-Scale News Events,"Priyanka Kargupta, Yunyi Zhang, Yizhu Jiao, Siru Ouyang, Jiawei Han","Episodic structures are inherently interpretable and adaptable to evolving large-scale key events. However, state-of-the-art automatic event detection methods overlook event episodes and, therefore, struggle with these crucial characteristics. This paper introduces a novel task, episode detection, aimed at identifying episodes from a news corpus containing key event articles. An episode describes a cohesive cluster of core entities (e.g., ""protesters"", ""police"") performing actions at a specific time and location. Furthermore, an episode is a significant part of a larger group of episodes under a particular key event. Automatically detecting episodes is challenging because, unlike key events and atomic actions, we cannot rely on explicit mentions of times and locations to distinguish between episodes or use semantic similarity to merge inconsistent episode co-references. To address these challenges, we introduce EpiMine, an unsupervised episode detection framework that (1) automatically identifies the most salient, key-event-relevant terms and segments, (2) determines candidate episodes in an article based on natural episodic partitions estimated through shifts in discriminative term combinations, and (3) refines and forms final episode clusters using large language model-based reasoning on the candidate episodes. We construct three diverse, real-world event datasets annotated at the episode level. EpiMine outperforms all baselines on these datasets by an average 59.2% increase across all metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04873v1,2024-08
SCOI: Syntax-augmented Coverage-based In-context Example Selection for Machine Translation,"Chenming Tang, Zhixiang Wang, Yunfang Wu","In-context learning (ICL) greatly improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) on various down-stream tasks, where the improvement highly depends on the quality of demonstrations. In this work, we introduce syntactic knowledge to select better in-context examples for machine translation (MT). We propose a new strategy, namely Syntax-augmented COverage-based In-context example selection (SCOI), leveraging the deep syntactic structure beyond conventional word matching. Specifically, we measure the set-level syntactic coverage by computing the coverage of polynomial terms with the help of a simplified tree-to-polynomial algorithm, and lexical coverage using word overlap. Furthermore, we devise an alternate selection approach to combine both coverage measures, taking advantage of syntactic and lexical information. We conduct experiments with two multi-lingual LLMs on six translation directions. Empirical results show that our proposed SCOI obtains the highest average COMET score among all learning-free methods, indicating that combining syntactic and lexical coverage successfully helps to select better in-context examples for MT.

Enhancing Exploratory Learning through Exploratory Search with the Emergence of Large Language Models,"Yiming Luo, Patrick Cheong-Iao Pang, Shanton Chang","In the information era, how learners find, evaluate, and effectively use information has become a challenging issue, especially with the added complexity of large language models (LLMs) that have further confused learners in their information retrieval and search activities. This study attempts to unpack this complexity by combining exploratory search strategies with the theories of exploratory learning to form a new theoretical model of exploratory learning from the perspective of students' learning. Our work adapts Kolb's learning model by incorporating high-frequency exploration and feedback loops, aiming to promote deep cognitive and higher-order cognitive skill development in students. Additionally, this paper discusses and suggests how advanced LLMs integrated into information retrieval and information theory can support students in their exploratory searches, contributing theoretically to promoting student-computer interaction and supporting their learning journeys in the new era with LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08894v2,2024-08

Ensemble BERT: A student social network text sentiment classification model based on ensemble learning and BERT architecture,"Kai Jiang, Honghao Yang, Yuexian Wang, Qianru Chen, Yiming Luo","The mental health assessment of middle school students has always been one of the focuses in the field of education. This paper introduces a new ensemble learning network based on BERT, employing the concept of enhancing model performance by integrating multiple classifiers. We trained a range of BERT-based learners, which combined using the majority voting method. We collect social network text data of middle school students through China's Weibo and apply the method to the task of classifying emotional tendencies in middle school students' social network texts. Experimental results suggest that the ensemble learning network has a better performance than the base model and the performance of the ensemble learning model, consisting of three single-layer BERT models, is barely the same as a three-layer BERT model but requires 11.58% more training time. Therefore, in terms of balancing prediction effect and efficiency, the deeper BERT network should be preferred for training.

Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, allowing changes in one to be automatically reflected in the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more.

We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space.

h4rm3l: A Dynamic Benchmark of Composable Jailbreak Attacks for LLM Safety Assessment,"Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Ananjan Nandi, Gabriel Poesia, Davide Ghilardi, Anna Goldie, Federico Bianchi, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning","The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical concern due to a lack of adequate benchmarks for systematically evaluating their ability to resist generating harmful content. Previous efforts towards automated red teaming involve static or templated sets of illicit requests and adversarial prompts which have limited utility given jailbreak attacks' evolving and composable nature. We propose a novel dynamic benchmark of composable jailbreak attacks to move beyond static datasets and taxonomies of attacks and harms. Our approach consists of three components collectively called h4rm3l: (1) a domain-specific language that formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized prompt transformation primitives, (2) bandit-based few-shot program synthesis algorithms that generate novel attacks optimized to penetrate the safety filters of a target black box LLM, and (3) open-source automated red-teaming software employing the previous two components. We use h4rm3l to generate a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and proprietary LLMs. Several of our synthesized attacks are more effective than previously reported ones, with Attack Success Rates exceeding 90% on SOTA closed language models such as claude-3-haiku and GPT4-o. By generating datasets of jailbreak attacks in a unified formal representation, h4rm3l enables reproducible benchmarking and automated red-teaming, contributes to understanding LLM safety limitations, and supports the development of robust defenses in an increasingly LLM-integrated world.

We employ a student-teacher architecture, utilizing Zephyr-7b-beta and Phi3-mini-128 as student models and GPT-4o as the teacher, to dynamically select between prompt refinement, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning strategies. Our experiments on 294 clinical notes covering 12 post-radiotherapy toxicity symptoms demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The RAG method proved most efficient, improving average accuracy scores from 0.32 to 0.73 for Zephyr-7b-beta and from 0.40 to 0.87 for Phi3-mini-128 during refinement. In the test set, both models showed an approximate 0.20 increase in accuracy across symptoms. Notably, this improvement was achieved at a cost 45 times lower than GPT-4o for Zephyr and 79 times lower for Phi-3.

LogogramNLP: Comparing Visual and Textual Representations of Ancient Logographic Writing Systems for NLP,"Danlu Chen, Freda Shi, Aditi Agarwal, Jacobo Myerston, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick","Standard natural language processing (NLP) pipelines operate on symbolic representations of language, which typically consist of sequences of discrete tokens. However, creating an analogous representation for ancient logographic writing systems is an extremely labor intensive process that requires expert knowledge. At present, a large portion of logographic data persists in a purely visual form due to the absence of transcription -- this issue poses a bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply NLP toolkits to study ancient logographic languages: most of the relevant data are images of writing.   This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations of language offers a potential solution. We introduce LogogramNLP, the first benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring both transcribed and visual datasets for four writing systems along with annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. Our experiments compare systems that employ recent visual and text encoding strategies as backbones. The results demonstrate that visual representations outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04628v1,2024-08

Better Alignment with Instruction Back-and-Forth Translation,"Thao Nguyen, Jeffrey Li, Sewoong Oh, Ludwig Schmidt, Jason Weston, Luke Zettlemoyer, Xian Li","We propose a new method, instruction back-and-forth translation, to construct high-quality synthetic data grounded in world knowledge for aligning large language models (LLMs). Given documents from a web corpus, we generate and curate synthetic instructions using the backtranslation approach proposed by Li et al.(2023a), and rewrite the responses to improve their quality further based on the initial documents. Fine-tuning with the resulting (backtranslated instruction, rewritten response) pairs yields higher win rates on AlpacaEval than using other common instruction datasets such as Humpback, ShareGPT, Open Orca, Alpaca-GPT4 and Self-instruct. We also demonstrate that rewriting the responses with an LLM outperforms direct distillation, and the two generated text distributions exhibit significant distinction in embedding space. Further analysis shows that our backtranslated instructions are of higher quality than other sources of synthetic instructions, while our responses are more diverse and complex than those obtained from distillation. Overall we find that instruction back-and-forth translation combines the best of both worlds -- making use of the information diversity and quantity found on the web, while ensuring the quality of the responses which is necessary for effective alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04614v2,2024-08
Code-switching in text and speech reveals information-theoretic audience design,"Debasmita Bhattacharya, Marten van Schijndel","In this work, we use language modeling to investigate the factors that influence code-switching. Code-switching occurs when a speaker alternates between one language variety (the primary language) and another (the secondary language), and is widely observed in multilingual contexts. Recent work has shown that code-switching is often correlated with areas of high information load in the primary language, but it is unclear whether high primary language load only makes the secondary language relatively easier to produce at code-switching points (speaker-driven code-switching), or whether code-switching is additionally used by speakers to signal the need for greater attention on the part of listeners (audience-driven code-switching). In this paper, we use bilingual Chinese-English online forum posts and transcripts of spontaneous Chinese-English speech to replicate prior findings that high primary language (Chinese) information load is correlated with switches to the secondary language (English). We then demonstrate that the information load of the English productions is even higher than that of meaning equivalent Chinese alternatives, and these are therefore not easier to produce, providing evidence of audience-driven influences in code-switching at the level of the communication channel, not just at the sociolinguistic level, in both writing and speech.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04596v1,2024-08
"Towards Resilient and Efficient LLMs: A Comparative Study of Efficiency, Performance, and Adversarial Robustness","Xiaojing Fan, Chunliang Tao","With the increasing demand for practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), many attention-efficient models have been developed to balance performance and computational cost. However, the adversarial robustness of these models remains under-explored. In this work, we design a framework to investigate the trade-off between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness of LLMs and conduct extensive experiments on three prominent models with varying levels of complexity and efficiency -- Transformer++, Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformer, and MatMul-Free LM -- utilizing the GLUE and AdvGLUE datasets. The AdvGLUE dataset extends the GLUE dataset with adversarial samples designed to challenge model robustness. Our results show that while the GLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE tasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative robustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack levels. These findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to achieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource constraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04585v3,2024-08
SCENE: Evaluating Explainable AI Techniques Using Soft Counterfactuals,"Haoran Zheng, Utku Pamuksuz","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in enhancing the transparency and accountability of AI models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, popular XAI methods such as LIME and SHAP have been found to be unstable and potentially misleading, underscoring the need for a standardized evaluation approach. This paper introduces SCENE (Soft Counterfactual Evaluation for Natural language Explainability), a novel evaluation method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate Soft Counterfactual explanations in a zero-shot manner. By focusing on token-based substitutions, SCENE creates contextually appropriate and semantically meaningful Soft Counterfactuals without extensive fine-tuning. SCENE adopts Validitysoft and Csoft metrics to assess the effectiveness of model-agnostic XAI methods in text classification tasks.

Learning Fine-Grained Grounded Citations for Attributed Large Language Models,"Lei Huang, Xiaocheng Feng, Weitao Ma, Yuxuan Gu, Weihong Zhong, Xiachong Feng, Weijiang Yu, Weihua Peng, Duyu Tang, Dandan Tu, Bing Qin","Despite the impressive performance on information-seeking tasks, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with hallucinations. Attributed LLMs, which augment generated text with in-line citations, have shown potential in mitigating hallucinations and improving verifiability. However, current approaches suffer from suboptimal citation quality due to their reliance on in-context learning. Furthermore, the practice of citing only coarse document identifiers makes it challenging for users to perform fine-grained verification. In this work, we introduce FRONT, a training framework designed to teach LLMs to generate Fine-Grained Grounded Citations. By grounding model outputs in fine-grained supporting quotes, these quotes guide the generation of grounded and consistent responses, not only improving citation quality but also facilitating fine-grained verification. Experiments on the ALCE benchmark demonstrate the efficacy of FRONT in generating superior grounded responses and highly supportive citations. With LLaMA-2-7B, the framework significantly outperforms all the baselines, achieving an average of 14.21% improvement in citation quality across all datasets, even surpassing ChatGPT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04568v1,2024-08
Understanding the Performance and Estimating the Cost of LLM Fine-Tuning,"Yuchen Xia, Jiho Kim, Yuhan Chen, Haojie Ye, Souvik Kundu, Cong Hao, Nishil Talati","Due to the cost-prohibitive nature of training Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning has emerged as an attractive alternative for specializing LLMs for specific tasks using limited compute resources in a cost-effective manner. In this paper, we characterize sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) based LLM fine-tuning to understand their accuracy and runtime performance on a single GPU. Our evaluation provides unique insights into the training efficacy of sparse and dense versions of MoE models, as well as their runtime characteristics, including maximum batch size, execution time breakdown, end-to-end throughput, GPU hardware utilization, and load distribution. Our study identifies the optimization of the MoE layer as crucial for further improving the performance of LLM fine-tuning. Using our profiling results, we also develop and validate an analytical model to estimate the cost of LLM fine-tuning on the cloud. This model, based on parameters of the model and GPU architecture, estimates LLM throughput and the cost of training, aiding practitioners in industry and academia to budget the cost of fine-tuning a specific model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04693v1,2024-08
Conversational Prompt Engineering,"Liat Ein-Dor, Orith Toledo-Ronen, Artem Spector, Shai Gretz, Lena Dankin, Alon Halfon, Yoav Katz, Noam Slonim","Prompts are how humans communicate with LLMs. Informative prompts are essential for guiding LLMs to produce the desired output. However, prompt engineering is often tedious and time-consuming, requiring significant expertise, limiting its widespread use. We propose Conversational Prompt Engineering (CPE), a user-friendly tool that helps users create personalized prompts for their specific tasks. CPE uses a chat model to briefly interact with users, helping them articulate their output preferences and integrating these into the prompt. The process includes two main stages: first, the model uses user-provided unlabeled data to generate data-driven questions and utilize user responses to shape the initial instruction. Then, the model shares the outputs generated by the instruction and uses user feedback to further refine the instruction and the outputs. The final result is a few-shot prompt, where the outputs approved by the user serve as few-shot examples. A user study on summarization tasks demonstrates the value of CPE in creating personalized, high-performing prompts. The results suggest that the zero-shot prompt obtained is comparable to its - much longer - few-shot counterpart, indicating significant savings in scenarios involving repetitive tasks with large text volumes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04560v1,2024-08
BA-LoRA: Bias-Alleviating Low-Rank Adaptation to Mitigate Catastrophic Inheritance in Large Language Models,"Yupeng Chang, Yi Chang, Yuan Wu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, adapting LLMs to downstream applications requires computationally intensive and memory-demanding fine-tuning procedures. To alleviate these burdens, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged as a promising approach to tailor LLMs with minimal computational overhead. While PEFT methods offer substantial advantages, they do not fully address the pervasive issue of bias propagation from pre-training data. This work introduces Bias-Alleviating Low-Rank Adaptation (BA-LoRA), a novel PEFT method designed to counteract bias inheritance. BA-LoRA incorporates three distinct regularization terms: (1) a consistency regularizer, (2) a diversity regularizer, and (3) a singular value decomposition regularizer. These regularizers aim to enhance the models' consistency, diversity, and generalization capabilities during fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks using prominent LLMs such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma. The results demonstrate that BA-LoRA outperforms LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants. Moreover, our method effectively mitigates the adverse effects of pre-training bias, leading to more reliable and robust model outputs.

This is in large part due to the absence of evidence of intermediate forms. This work introduces a new open corpus, the Moly\'e corpus, which combines stereotypical representations of three kinds of language variation in Europe with early attestations of French-based Creole languages across a period of 400 years. It is intended to facilitate future research on the continuity between contact situations in Europe and Creolophone (former) colonies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04554v1,2024-08
MemeMind at ArAIEval Shared Task: Spotting Persuasive Spans in Arabic Text with Persuasion Techniques Identification,"Md Rafiul Biswas, Zubair Shah, Wajdi Zaghouani","This paper focuses on detecting propagandistic spans and persuasion techniques in Arabic text from tweets and news paragraphs. Each entry in the dataset contains a text sample and corresponding labels that indicate the start and end positions of propaganda techniques within the text. Tokens falling within a labeled span were assigned ""B"" (Begin) or ""I"" (Inside), ""O"", corresponding to the specific propaganda technique. Using attention masks, we created uniform lengths for each span and assigned BIO tags to each token based on the provided labels. Then, we used AraBERT-base pre-trained model for Arabic text tokenization and embeddings with a token classification layer to identify propaganda techniques. Our training process involves a two-phase fine-tuning approach. First, we train only the classification layer for a few epochs, followed by full model fine-tuning, updating all parameters. This methodology allows the model to adapt to the specific characteristics of the propaganda detection task while leveraging the knowledge captured by the pre-trained AraBERT model.

Compromesso! Italian Many-Shot Jailbreaks Undermine the Safety of Large Language Models,"Fabio Pernisi, Dirk Hovy, Paul Röttger","As diverse linguistic communities and users adopt large language models (LLMs), assessing their safety across languages becomes critical. Despite ongoing efforts to make LLMs safe, they can still be made to behave unsafely with jailbreaking, a technique in which models are prompted to act outside their operational guidelines. Research on LLM safety and jailbreaking, however, has so far mostly focused on English, limiting our understanding of LLM safety in other languages. We contribute towards closing this gap by investigating the effectiveness of many-shot jailbreaking, where models are prompted with unsafe demonstrations to induce unsafe behaviour, in Italian. To enable our analysis, we create a new dataset of unsafe Italian question-answer pairs. With this dataset, we identify clear safety vulnerabilities in four families of open-weight LLMs. We find that the models exhibit unsafe behaviors even when prompted with few unsafe demonstrations, and -- more alarmingly -- that this tendency rapidly escalates with more demonstrations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04522v1,2024-08
Articulatory Configurations across Genders and Periods in French Radio and TV archives,"Benjamin Elie, David Doukhan, Rémi Uro, Lucas Ondel-Yang, Albert Rilliard, Simon Devauchelle","This paper studies changes in articulatory configurations across genders and periods using an inversion from acoustic to articulatory parameters. From a diachronic corpus based on French media archives spanning 60 years from 1955 to 2015, automatic transcription and forced alignment allowed extracting the central frame of each vowel. More than one million frames were obtained from over a thousand speakers across gender and age categories. Their formants were used from these vocalic frames to fit the parameters of Maeda's articulatory model. Evaluations of the quality of these processes are provided. We focus here on two parameters of Maeda's model linked to total vocal tract length: the relative position of the larynx (higher for females) and the lips protrusion (more protruded for males). Implications for voice quality across genders are discussed. The effect across periods seems gender independent; thus, the assertion that females lowered their pitch with time is not supported.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04519v1,2024-08
Can LLMs Beat Humans in Debating? A Dynamic Multi-agent Framework for Competitive Debate,"Yiqun Zhang, Xiaocui Yang, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang, Kaisong Song","Competitive debate is a complex task of computational argumentation. Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations and lack competitiveness in this field. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent for Debate (Agent4Debate), a dynamic multi-agent framework based on LLMs designed to enhance their capabilities in competitive debate. Drawing inspiration from human behavior in debate preparation and execution, Agent4Debate employs a collaborative architecture where four specialized agents, involving Searcher, Analyzer, Writer, and Reviewer, dynamically interact and cooperate. These agents work throughout the debate process, covering multiple stages from initial research and argument formulation to rebuttal and summary. To comprehensively evaluate framework performance, we construct the Competitive Debate Arena, comprising 66 carefully selected Chinese debate motions. We recruit ten experienced human debaters and collect records of 200 debates involving Agent4Debate, baseline models, and humans. The evaluation employs the Debatrix automatic scoring system and professional human reviewers based on the established Debatrix-Elo and Human-Elo ranking. Experimental results indicate that the state-of-the-art Agent4Debate exhibits capabilities comparable to those of humans. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the agent structure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04472v2,2024-08
Crowd Intelligence for Early Misinformation Prediction on Social Media,"Megha Sundriyal, Harshit Choudhary, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Md Shad Akhtar","Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, causing serious damage by influencing public opinion, promoting dangerous behavior, or eroding trust in reliable sources. It spreads too fast for traditional fact-checking, stressing the need for predictive methods. We introduce CROWDSHIELD, a crowd intelligence-based method for early misinformation prediction. We hypothesize that the crowd's reactions to misinformation reveal its accuracy. Furthermore, we hinge upon exaggerated assertions/claims and replies with particular positions/stances on the source post within a conversation thread. We employ Q-learning to capture the two dimensions -- stances and claims. We utilize deep Q-learning due to its proficiency in navigating complex decision spaces and effectively learning network properties. Additionally, we use a transformer-based encoder to develop a comprehensive understanding of both content and context. This multifaceted approach helps ensure the model pays attention to user interaction and stays anchored in the communication's content. We propose MIST, a manually annotated misinformation detection Twitter corpus comprising nearly 200 conversation threads with more than 14K replies. In experiments, CROWDSHIELD outperformed ten baseline systems, achieving an improvement of ~4% macro-F1 score. We conduct an ablation study and error analysis to validate our proposed model's performance. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/LCS2-IIITD/CrowdShield.git.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04463v1,2024-08
Synthetic SQL Column Descriptions and Their Impact on Text-to-SQL Performance,"Niklas Wretblad, Oskar Holmström, Erik Larsson, Axel Wiksäter, Oscar Söderlund, Hjalmar Öhman, Ture Pontén, Martin Forsberg, Martin Sörme, Fredrik Heintz","Relational databases often suffer from uninformative descriptors of table contents, such as ambiguous columns and hard-to-interpret values, impacting both human users and text-to-SQL models. In this paper, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate detailed natural language descriptions for SQL database columns, aiming to improve text-to-SQL performance and automate metadata creation. We create a dataset of gold column descriptions based on the BIRD-Bench benchmark, manually refining its column descriptions and creating a taxonomy for categorizing column difficulty. We then evaluate several different LLMs in generating column descriptions across the columns and different difficulties in the dataset, finding that models unsurprisingly struggle with columns that exhibit inherent ambiguity, highlighting the need for manual expert input. We also find that incorporating such generated column descriptions consistently enhances text-to-SQL model performance, particularly for larger models like GPT-4o, Qwen2 72B and Mixtral 22Bx8. Notably, Qwen2-generated descriptions, containing by annotators deemed superfluous information, outperform manually curated gold descriptions, suggesting that models benefit from more detailed metadata than humans expect. Future work will investigate the specific features of these high-performing descriptions and explore other types of metadata, such as numerical reasoning and synonyms, to further improve text-to-SQL systems. The dataset, annotations and code will all be made available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04691v4,2024-08
AcrosticSleuth: Probabilistic Identification and Ranking of Acrostics in Multilingual Corpora,"Aleksandr Fedchin, Isabel Cooperman, Pramit Chaudhuri, Joseph P. Dexter","For centuries, writers have hidden messages in their texts as acrostics, where initial letters of consecutive lines or paragraphs form meaningful words or phrases. Scholars searching for acrostics manually can only focus on a few authors at a time and often favor qualitative arguments in discussing intentionally. We aim to put the study of acrostics on firmer statistical footing by presenting AcrosticSleuth, a first-of-its-kind tool that automatically identifies acrostics and ranks them by the probability that the sequence of characters does not occur by chance (and therefore may have been inserted intentionally). Acrostics are rare, so we formalize the problem as a binary classification task in the presence of extreme class imbalance. To evaluate AcrosticSleuth, we present the Acrostic Identification Dataset (AcrostID), a collection of acrostics from the WikiSource online database. Despite the class imbalance, AcrosticSleuth achieves F1 scores of 0.39, 0.59, and 0.66 on French, English, and Russian subdomains of WikiSource, respectively. We further demonstrate that AcrosticSleuth can identify previously unknown high-profile instances of wordplay, such as the acrostic spelling ARSPOETICA (``art of poetry"") by Italian Humanist Albertino Mussato and English philosopher Thomas Hobbes' signature in the opening paragraphs of The Elements of Law.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04427v1,2024-08
Recognizing Emotion Regulation Strategies from Human Behavior with Large Language Models,"Philipp Müller, Alexander Heimerl, Sayed Muddashir Hossain, Lea Siegel, Jan Alexandersson, Patrick Gebhard, Elisabeth André, Tanja Schneeberger","Human emotions are often not expressed directly, but regulated according to internal processes and social display rules. For affective computing systems, an understanding of how users regulate their emotions can be highly useful, for example to provide feedback in job interview training, or in psychotherapeutic scenarios. However, at present no method to automatically classify different emotion regulation strategies in a cross-user scenario exists. At the same time, recent studies showed that instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can reach impressive performance across a variety of affect recognition tasks such as categorical emotion recognition or sentiment analysis. While these results are promising, it remains unclear to what extent the representational power of LLMs can be utilized in the more subtle task of classifying users' internal emotion regulation strategy. To close this gap, we make use of the recently introduced \textsc{Deep} corpus for modeling the social display of the emotion shame, where each point in time is annotated with one of seven different emotion regulation classes. We fine-tune Llama2-7B as well as the recently introduced Gemma model using Low-rank Optimization on prompts generated from different sources of information on the \textsc{Deep} corpus. These include verbal and nonverbal behavior, person factors, as well as the results of an in-depth interview after the interaction. Our results show, that a fine-tuned Llama2-7B LLM is able to classify the utilized emotion regulation strategy with high accuracy (0.84) without needing access to data from post-interaction interviews. This represents a significant improvement over previous approaches based on Bayesian Networks and highlights the importance of modeling verbal behavior in emotion regulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04420v1,2024-08
Enhancing Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models with In-Context Learning,"Seong-Il Park, Seung-Woo Choi, Na-Hyun Kim, Jay-Yoon Lee","Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) have significantly improved performance in open-domain question answering (QA) by leveraging external knowledge. However, RALMs still struggle with unanswerable queries, where the retrieved contexts do not contain the correct answer, and with conflicting information, where different sources provide contradictory answers due to imperfect retrieval. This study introduces an in-context learning-based approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of RALMs, making them more robust in imperfect retrieval scenarios. Our method incorporates Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) demonstrations, referred to as cases, to boost the model's capabilities to identify unanswerabilities and conflicts among the retrieved contexts. Experiments on two open-domain QA datasets show that our approach increases accuracy in identifying unanswerable and conflicting scenarios without requiring additional fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that in-context learning can effectively enhance the robustness of RALMs in open-domain QA tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04414v1,2024-08
Exploring Reasoning Biases in Large Language Models Through Syllogism: Insights from the NeuBAROCO Dataset,"Kentaro Ozeki, Risako Ando, Takanobu Morishita, Hirohiko Abe, Koji Mineshima, Mitsuhiro Okada","This paper explores the question of how accurately current large language models can perform logical reasoning in natural language, with an emphasis on whether these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans. Specifically, our study focuses on syllogistic reasoning, a form of deductive reasoning extensively studied in cognitive science as a natural form of human reasoning. We present a syllogism dataset called NeuBAROCO, which consists of syllogistic reasoning problems in English and Japanese. This dataset was originally designed for psychological experiments to assess human reasoning capabilities using various forms of syllogisms. Our experiments with leading large language models indicate that these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans, along with other error tendencies. Notably, there is significant room for improvement in reasoning problems where the relationship between premises and hypotheses is neither entailment nor contradiction. We also present experimental results and in-depth analysis using a new Chain-of-Thought prompting method, which asks LLMs to translate syllogisms into abstract logical expressions and then explain their reasoning process. Our analysis using this method suggests that the primary limitations of LLMs lie in the reasoning process itself rather than the interpretation of syllogisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04403v1,2024-08
Automated Educational Question Generation at Different Bloom's Skill Levels using Large Language Models: Strategies and Evaluation,"Nicy Scaria, Suma Dharani Chenna, Deepak Subramani","Developing questions that are pedagogically sound, relevant, and promote learning is a challenging and time-consuming task for educators. Modern-day large language models (LLMs) generate high-quality content across multiple domains, potentially helping educators to develop high-quality questions. Automated educational question generation (AEQG) is important in scaling online education catering to a diverse student population. Past attempts at AEQG have shown limited abilities to generate questions at higher cognitive levels. In this study, we examine the ability of five state-of-the-art LLMs of different sizes to generate diverse and high-quality questions of different cognitive levels, as defined by Bloom's taxonomy. We use advanced prompting techniques with varying complexity for AEQG. We conducted expert and LLM-based evaluations to assess the linguistic and pedagogical relevance and quality of the questions. Our findings suggest that LLms can generate relevant and high-quality educational questions of different cognitive levels when prompted with adequate information, although there is a significant variance in the performance of the five LLms considered. We also show that automated evaluation is not on par with human evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04394v1,2024-08
Open-domain Implicit Format Control for Large Language Model Generation,"Yiqun Yao, Wenjia Ma, Xuezhi Fang, Xin Jiang, Xiang Li, Xuying Meng, Peng Han, Jing Li, Aixin Sun, Yequan Wang","Controlling the format of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs) is a critical functionality in various applications. Current methods typically employ constrained decoding with rule-based automata or fine-tuning with manually crafted format instructions, both of which struggle with open-domain format requirements. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework for controlled generation in LLMs, leveraging user-provided, one-shot QA pairs. This study investigates LLMs' capabilities to follow open-domain, one-shot constraints and replicate the format of the example answers. We observe that this is a non-trivial problem for current LLMs. We also develop a dataset collection methodology for supervised fine-tuning that enhances the open-domain format control of LLMs without degrading output quality, as well as a benchmark on which we evaluate both the helpfulness and format correctness of LLM outputs. The resulting datasets, named OIFC-SFT, along with the related code, will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cofe-ai/OIFC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04392v1,2024-08

The goal of this shared task is to generate Chinese metaphors using machine learning techniques and effectively identifying basic components of metaphorical sentences. It is divided into two subtasks: 1) Metaphor Generation, which involves creating a metaphor from a provided tuple consisting of TENOR, GROUND, and VEHICLE. The goal here is to synthesize a metaphor that connects the subject (i.e. TENOR) with the object (i.e. VEHICLE), guided by the concept of the GROUND. 2) Metaphor Components Identification, which extracts the most fitting TENORs, GROUNDs, and VEHICLEs from a metaphorical sentence. This component requires the identification of the most fitting metaphor elements that correspond to the specified grounds.

Simulating Articulatory Trajectories with Phonological Feature Interpolation,"Angelo Ortiz Tandazo, Thomas Schatz, Thomas Hueber, Emmanuel Dupoux","As a first step towards a complete computational model of speech learning involving perception-production loops, we investigate the forward mapping between pseudo-motor commands and articulatory trajectories. Two phonological feature sets, based respectively on generative and articulatory phonology, are used to encode a phonetic target sequence. Different interpolation techniques are compared to generate smooth trajectories in these feature spaces, with a potential optimisation of the target value and timing to capture co-articulation effects. We report the Pearson correlation between a linear projection of the generated trajectories and articulatory data derived from a multi-speaker dataset of electromagnetic articulography (EMA) recordings.

Enhancing Journalism with AI: A Study of Contextualized Image Captioning for News Articles using LLMs and LMMs,"Aliki Anagnostopoulou, Thiago Gouvea, Daniel Sonntag","Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have significantly impacted the AI community, industry, and various economic sectors. In journalism, integrating AI poses unique challenges and opportunities, particularly in enhancing the quality and efficiency of news reporting. This study explores how LLMs and LMMs can assist journalistic practice by generating contextualised captions for images accompanying news articles. We conducted experiments using the GoodNews dataset to evaluate the ability of LMMs (BLIP-2, GPT-4v, or LLaVA) to incorporate one of two types of context: entire news articles, or extracted named entities. In addition, we compared their performance to a two-stage pipeline composed of a captioning model (BLIP-2, OFA, or ViT-GPT2) with post-hoc contextualisation with LLMs (GPT-4 or LLaMA). We assess a diversity of models, and we find that while the choice of contextualisation model is a significant factor for the two-stage pipelines, this is not the case in the LMMs, where smaller, open-source models perform well compared to proprietary, GPT-powered ones. Additionally, we found that controlling the amount of provided context enhances performance. These results highlight the limitations of a fully automated approach and underscore the necessity for an interactive, human-in-the-loop strategy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04331v1,2024-08
Multi-Turn Context Jailbreak Attack on Large Language Models From First Principles,"Xiongtao Sun, Deyue Zhang, Dongdong Yang, Quanchen Zou, Hui Li","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the performance of numerous applications, from intelligent conversations to text generation. However, their inherent security vulnerabilities have become an increasingly significant challenge, especially with respect to jailbreak attacks. Attackers can circumvent the security mechanisms of these LLMs, breaching security constraints and causing harmful outputs. Focusing on multi-turn semantic jailbreak attacks, we observe that existing methods lack specific considerations for the role of multiturn dialogues in attack strategies, leading to semantic deviations during continuous interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we establish a theoretical foundation for multi-turn attacks by considering their support in jailbreak attacks, and based on this, propose a context-based contextual fusion black-box jailbreak attack method, named Context Fusion Attack (CFA). This method approach involves filtering and extracting key terms from the target, constructing contextual scenarios around these terms, dynamically integrating the target into the scenarios, replacing malicious key terms within the target, and thereby concealing the direct malicious intent. Through comparisons on various mainstream LLMs and red team datasets, we have demonstrated CFA's superior success rate, divergence, and harmfulness compared to other multi-turn attack strategies, particularly showcasing significant advantages on Llama3 and GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04686v1,2024-08
Using generative AI to support standardization work -- the case of 3GPP,"Miroslaw Staron, Jonathan Strom, Albin Karlsson, Wilhelm Meding","Standardization processes build upon consensus between partners, which depends on their ability to identify points of disagreement and resolving them. Large standardization organizations, like the 3GPP or ISO, rely on leaders of work packages who can correctly, and efficiently, identify disagreements, discuss them and reach a consensus. This task, however, is effort-, labor-intensive and costly. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying similarities, dissimilarities and discussion points using large language models. In a design science research study, we work with one of the organizations which leads several workgroups in the 3GPP standard. Our goal is to understand how well the language models can support the standardization process in becoming more cost-efficient, faster and more reliable. Our results show that generic models for text summarization correlate well with domain expert's and delegate's assessments (Pearson correlation between 0.66 and 0.98), but that there is a need for domain-specific models to provide better discussion materials for the standardization groups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12611v1,2024-08
HydraFormer: One Encoder For All Subsampling Rates,"Yaoxun Xu, Xingchen Song, Zhiyong Wu, Di Wu, Zhendong Peng, Binbin Zhang","In automatic speech recognition, subsampling is essential for tackling diverse scenarios. However, the inadequacy of a single subsampling rate to address various real-world situations often necessitates training and deploying multiple models, consequently increasing associated costs. To address this issue, we propose HydraFormer, comprising HydraSub, a Conformer-based encoder, and a BiTransformer-based decoder. HydraSub encompasses multiple branches, each representing a distinct subsampling rate, allowing for the flexible selection of any branch during inference based on the specific use case. HydraFormer can efficiently manage different subsampling rates, significantly reducing training and deployment expenses. Experiments on AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech datasets reveal that HydraFormer effectively adapts to various subsampling rates and languages while maintaining high recognition performance. Additionally, HydraFormer showcases exceptional stability, sustaining consistent performance under various initialization conditions, and exhibits robust transferability by learning from pretrained single subsampling rate automatic speech recognition models\footnote{Model code and scripts: https://github.com/HydraFormer/hydraformer}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04325v1,2024-08
Trans-Tokenization and Cross-lingual Vocabulary Transfers: Language Adaptation of LLMs for Low-Resource NLP,"François Remy, Pieter Delobelle, Hayastan Avetisyan, Alfiya Khabibullina, Miryam de Lhoneux, Thomas Demeester","The development of monolingual language models for low and mid-resource languages continues to be hindered by the difficulty in sourcing high-quality training data. In this study, we present a novel cross-lingual vocabulary transfer strategy, trans-tokenization, designed to tackle this challenge and enable more efficient language adaptation. Our approach focuses on adapting a high-resource monolingual LLM to an unseen target language by initializing the token embeddings of the target language using a weighted average of semantically similar token embeddings from the source language. For this, we leverage a translation resource covering both the source and target languages. We validate our method with the Tweeties, a series of trans-tokenized LLMs, and demonstrate their competitive performance on various downstream tasks across a small but diverse set of languages. Additionally, we introduce Hydra LLMs, models with multiple swappable language modeling heads and embedding tables, which further extend the capabilities of our trans-tokenization strategy. By designing a Hydra LLM based on the multilingual model TowerInstruct, we developed a state-of-the-art machine translation model for Tatar, in a zero-shot manner, completely bypassing the need for high-quality parallel data. This breakthrough is particularly significant for low-resource languages like Tatar, where high-quality parallel data is hard to come by. By lowering the data and time requirements for training high-quality models, our trans-tokenization strategy allows for the development of LLMs for a wider range of languages, especially those with limited resources. We hope that our work will inspire further research and collaboration in the field of cross-lingual vocabulary transfer and contribute to the empowerment of languages on a global scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04303v1,2024-08
Are Social Sentiments Inherent in LLMs? An Empirical Study on Extraction of Inter-demographic Sentiments,"Kunitomo Tanaka, Ryohei Sasano, Koichi Takeda","Large language models (LLMs) are supposed to acquire unconscious human knowledge and feelings, such as social common sense and biases, by training models from large amounts of text. However, it is not clear how much the sentiments of specific social groups can be captured in various LLMs. In this study, we focus on social groups defined in terms of nationality, religion, and race/ethnicity, and validate the extent to which sentiments between social groups can be captured in and extracted from LLMs. Specifically, we input questions regarding sentiments from one group to another into LLMs, apply sentiment analysis to the responses, and compare the results with social surveys. The validation results using five representative LLMs showed higher correlations with relatively small p-values for nationalities and religions, whose number of data points were relatively large. This result indicates that the LLM responses including the inter-group sentiments align well with actual social survey results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04293v1,2024-08
EMTeC: A Corpus of Eye Movements on Machine-Generated Texts,"Lena Sophia Bolliger, Patrick Haller, Isabelle Caroline Rose Cretton, David Robert Reich, Tannon Kew, Lena Ann Jäger","The Eye Movements on Machine-Generated Texts Corpus (EMTeC) is a naturalistic eye-movements-while-reading corpus of 107 native English speakers reading machine-generated texts. The texts are generated by three large language models using five different decoding strategies, and they fall into six different text type categories. EMTeC entails the eye movement data at all stages of pre-processing, i.e., the raw coordinate data sampled at 2000 Hz, the fixation sequences, and the reading measures. It further provides both the original and a corrected version of the fixation sequences, accounting for vertical calibration drift. Moreover, the corpus includes the language models' internals that underlie the generation of the stimulus texts: the transition scores, the attention scores, and the hidden states. The stimuli are annotated for a range of linguistic features both at text and at word level. We anticipate EMTeC to be utilized for a variety of use cases such as, but not restricted to, the investigation of reading behavior on machine-generated text and the impact of different decoding strategies; reading behavior on different text types; the development of new pre-processing, data filtering, and drift correction algorithms; the cognitive interpretability and enhancement of language models; and the assessment of the predictive power of surprisal and entropy for human reading times. The data at all stages of pre-processing, the model internals, and the code to reproduce the stimulus generation, data pre-processing and analyses can be accessed via https://github.com/DiLi-Lab/EMTeC/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04289v1,2024-08

This raises concerns about potential misuse, particularly within educational and academic domains. Thus, it is important to develop practical systems that can automate the process. Here, we present one such system, LLM-DetectAIve, designed for fine-grained detection. Unlike most previous work on machine-generated text detection, which focused on binary classification, LLM-DetectAIve supports four categories: (i) human-written, (ii) machine-generated, (iii) machine-written, then machine-humanized, and (iv) human-written, then machine-polished. Category (iii) aims to detect attempts to obfuscate the fact that a text was machine-generated, while category (iv) looks for cases where the LLM was used to polish a human-written text, which is typically acceptable in academic writing, but not in education. Our experiments show that LLM-DetectAIve can effectively identify the above four categories, which makes it a potentially useful tool in education, academia, and other domains.   LLM-DetectAIve is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/LLM-DetectAIve.

LaDiMo: Layer-wise Distillation Inspired MoEfier,"Sungyoon Kim, Youngjun Kim, Kihyo Moon, Minsung Jang","The advent of large language models has revolutionized natural language processing, but their increasing complexity has led to substantial training costs, resource demands, and environmental impacts. In response, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising alternative to dense models. Since training MoE models from scratch can be prohibitively expensive, recent studies have explored leveraging knowledge from pre-trained non-MoE models. However, existing approaches have limitations, such as requiring significant hardware resources and data. We propose a novel algorithm, LaDiMo, which efficiently converts a Transformer-based non-MoE model into a MoE model with minimal additional training cost. LaDiMo consists of two stages: layer-wise expert construction and routing policy decision. By harnessing the concept of Knowledge Distillation, we compress the model and rapidly recover its performance. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive router that optimizes inference efficiency by profiling the distribution of routing weights and determining a layer-wise policy that balances accuracy and latency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by converting the LLaMA2-7B model to a MoE model using only 100K tokens, reducing activated parameters by over 20% while keeping accuracy. Our approach offers a flexible and efficient solution for building and deploying MoE models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04278v1,2024-08
Analysis of Argument Structure Constructions in the Large Language Model BERT,"Pegah Ramezani, Achim Schilling, Patrick Krauss","This study investigates how BERT processes and represents Argument Structure Constructions (ASCs), extending previous LSTM analyses. Using a dataset of 2000 sentences across four ASC types (transitive, ditransitive, caused-motion, resultative), we analyzed BERT's token embeddings across 12 layers. Visualizations with MDS and t-SNE and clustering quantified by Generalized Discrimination Value (GDV) were used. Feedforward classifiers (probes) predicted construction categories from embeddings. CLS token embeddings clustered best in layers 2-4, decreased in intermediate layers, and slightly increased in final layers. DET and SUBJ embeddings showed consistent clustering in intermediate layers, VERB embeddings increased in clustering from layer 1 to 12, and OBJ embeddings peaked in layer 10. Probe accuracies indicated low construction information in layer 1, with over 90 percent accuracy from layer 2 onward, revealing latent construction information beyond GDV clustering. Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) analysis of attention weights showed OBJ tokens were crucial for differentiating ASCs, followed by VERB and DET tokens. SUBJ, CLS, and SEP tokens had insignificant FDR scores. This study highlights BERT's layered processing of linguistic constructions and its differences from LSTMs. Future research will compare these findings with neuroimaging data to understand the neural correlates of ASC processing. This research underscores neural language models' potential to mirror linguistic processing in the human brain, offering insights into the computational and neural mechanisms underlying language understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04270v1,2024-08
EfficientRAG: Efficient Retriever for Multi-Hop Question Answering,"Ziyuan Zhuang, Zhiyang Zhang, Sitao Cheng, Fangkai Yang, Jia Liu, Shujian Huang, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encounter difficulties when addressing complex questions like multi-hop queries. While iterative retrieval methods improve performance by gathering additional information, current approaches often rely on multiple calls of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce EfficientRAG, an efficient retriever for multi-hop question answering. EfficientRAG iteratively generates new queries without the need for LLM calls at each iteration and filters out irrelevant information. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientRAG surpasses existing RAG methods on three open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04259v2,2024-08
Explicating the Implicit: Argument Detection Beyond Sentence Boundaries,"Paul Roit, Aviv Slobodkin, Eran Hirsch, Arie Cattan, Ayal Klein, Valentina Pyatkin, Ido Dagan","Detecting semantic arguments of a predicate word has been conventionally modeled as a sentence-level task. The typical reader, however, perfectly interprets predicate-argument relations in a much wider context than just the sentence where the predicate was evoked. In this work, we reformulate the problem of argument detection through textual entailment to capture semantic relations across sentence boundaries. We propose a method that tests whether some semantic relation can be inferred from a full passage by first encoding it into a simple and standalone proposition and then testing for entailment against the passage. Our method does not require direct supervision, which is generally absent due to dataset scarcity, but instead builds on existing NLI and sentence-level SRL resources. Such a method can potentially explicate pragmatically understood relations into a set of explicit sentences. We demonstrate it on a recent document-level benchmark, outperforming some supervised methods and contemporary language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04246v1,2024-08
Learning to Rewrite: Generalized LLM-Generated Text Detection,"Wei Hao, Ran Li, Weiliang Zhao, Junfeng Yang, Chengzhi Mao","Large language models (LLMs) can be abused at scale to create non-factual content and spread disinformation. Detecting LLM-generated content is essential to mitigate these risks, but current classifiers often fail to generalize in open-world contexts. Prior work shows that LLMs tend to rewrite LLM-generated content less frequently, which can be used for detection and naturally generalizes to unforeseen data. However, we find that the rewriting edit distance between human and LLM content can be indistinguishable across domains, leading to detection failures. We propose training an LLM to rewrite input text, producing minimal edits for LLM-generated content and more edits for human-written text, deriving a distinguishable and generalizable edit distance difference across different domains. Experiments on text from 21 independent domains and three popular LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama-3) show that our classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot classifier by up to 20.6% on AUROC score and the rewriting classifier by 9.2% on F1 score. Our work suggests that LLM can effectively detect machine-generated text if they are trained properly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04237v1,2024-08

Mathfish: Evaluating Language Model Math Reasoning via Grounding in Educational Curricula,"Li Lucy, Tal August, Rose E. Wang, Luca Soldaini, Courtney Allison, Kyle Lo","To ensure that math curriculum is grade-appropriate and aligns with critical skills or concepts in accordance with educational standards, pedagogical experts can spend months carefully reviewing published math problems. Drawing inspiration from this process, our work presents a novel angle for evaluating language models' (LMs) mathematical abilities, by investigating whether they can discern skills and concepts enabled by math content. We contribute two datasets: one consisting of 385 fine-grained descriptions of K-12 math skills and concepts, or standards, from Achieve the Core (ATC), and another of 9.9K math problems labeled with these standards (MathFish). We develop two tasks for evaluating LMs' abilities to assess math problems: (1) verifying whether a problem aligns with a given standard, and (2) tagging a problem with all aligned standards. Working with experienced teachers, we find that LMs struggle to tag and verify standards linked to problems, and instead predict labels that are close to ground truth, but differ in subtle ways. We also show that LMs often generate problems that do not fully align with standards described in prompts, suggesting the need for careful scrutiny on use cases involving LMs for generating curricular materials. Finally, we categorize problems in GSM8k using math standards, allowing us to better understand why some problems are more difficult to solve for models than others.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04226v3,2024-08
Diffusion Guided Language Modeling,"Justin Lovelace, Varsha Kishore, Yiwei Chen, Kilian Q. Weinberger","Current language models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in text generation. However, for many applications it is desirable to control attributes, such as sentiment, or toxicity, of the generated language -- ideally tailored towards each specific use case and target audience. For auto-regressive language models, existing guidance methods are prone to decoding errors that cascade during generation and degrade performance. In contrast, text diffusion models can easily be guided with, for example, a simple linear sentiment classifier -- however they do suffer from significantly higher perplexity than auto-regressive alternatives. In this paper we use a guided diffusion model to produce a latent proposal that steers an auto-regressive language model to generate text with desired properties. Our model inherits the unmatched fluency of the auto-regressive approach and the plug-and-play flexibility of diffusion. We show that it outperforms previous plug-and-play guidance methods across a wide range of benchmark data sets. Further, controlling a new attribute in our framework is reduced to training a single logistic regression classifier.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04220v1,2024-08
Simplifying Translations for Children: Iterative Simplification Considering Age of Acquisition with LLMs,"Masashi Oshika, Makoto Morishita, Tsutomu Hirao, Ryohei Sasano, Koichi Takeda","In recent years, neural machine translation (NMT) has been widely used in everyday life. However, the current NMT lacks a mechanism to adjust the difficulty level of translations to match the user's language level. Additionally, due to the bias in the training data for NMT, translations of simple source sentences are often produced with complex words. In particular, this could pose a problem for children, who may not be able to understand the meaning of the translations correctly. In this study, we propose a method that replaces words with high Age of Acquisitions (AoA) in translations with simpler words to match the translations to the user's level. We achieve this by using large language models (LLMs), providing a triple of a source sentence, a translation, and a target word to be replaced. We create a benchmark dataset using back-translation on Simple English Wikipedia. The experimental results obtained from the dataset show that our method effectively replaces high-AoA words with lower-AoA words and, moreover, can iteratively replace most of the high-AoA words while still maintaining high BLEU and COMET scores.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04217v1,2024-08
Conversational AI Powered by Large Language Models Amplifies False Memories in Witness Interviews,"Samantha Chan, Pat Pataranutaporn, Aditya Suri, Wazeer Zulfikar, Pattie Maes, Elizabeth F. Loftus","This study examines the impact of AI on human false memories -- recollections of events that did not occur or deviate from actual occurrences. It explores false memory induction through suggestive questioning in Human-AI interactions, simulating crime witness interviews. Four conditions were tested: control, survey-based, pre-scripted chatbot, and generative chatbot using a large language model (LLM). Participants (N=200) watched a crime video, then interacted with their assigned AI interviewer or survey, answering questions including five misleading ones. False memories were assessed immediately and after one week. Results show the generative chatbot condition significantly increased false memory formation, inducing over 3 times more immediate false memories than the control and 1.7 times more than the survey method. 36.4% of users' responses to the generative chatbot were misled through the interaction. After one week, the number of false memories induced by generative chatbots remained constant. However, confidence in these false memories remained higher than the control after one week. Moderating factors were explored: users who were less familiar with chatbots but more familiar with AI technology, and more interested in crime investigations, were more susceptible to false memories. These findings highlight the potential risks of using advanced AI in sensitive contexts, like police interviews, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04681v1,2024-08
Attention Mechanism and Context Modeling System for Text Mining Machine Translation,"Yuwei Zhang, Junming Huang, Sitong Liu, Zexi Chen, Zizheng Li","This paper advances a novel architectural schema anchored upon the Transformer paradigm and innovatively amalgamates the K-means categorization algorithm to augment the contextual apprehension capabilities of the schema. The transformer model performs well in machine translation tasks due to its parallel computing power and multi-head attention mechanism. However, it may encounter contextual ambiguity or ignore local features when dealing with highly complex language structures. To circumvent this constraint, this exposition incorporates the K-Means algorithm, which is used to stratify the lexis and idioms of the input textual matter, thereby facilitating superior identification and preservation of the local structure and contextual intelligence of the language. The advantage of this combination is that K-Means can automatically discover the topic or concept regions in the text, which may be directly related to translation quality. Consequently, the schema contrived herein enlists K-Means as a preparatory phase antecedent to the Transformer and recalibrates the multi-head attention weights to assist in the discrimination of lexis and idioms bearing analogous semantics or functionalities. This ensures the schema accords heightened regard to the contextual intelligence embodied by these clusters during the training phase, rather than merely focusing on locational intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04216v2,2024-08
Dynamic Fog Computing for Enhanced LLM Execution in Medical Applications,"Philipp Zagar, Vishnu Ravi, Lauren Aalami, Stephan Krusche, Oliver Aalami, Paul Schmiedmayer","The ability of large language models (LLMs) to transform, interpret, and comprehend vast quantities of heterogeneous data presents a significant opportunity to enhance data-driven care delivery.

Towards Linguistic Neural Representation Learning and Sentence Retrieval from Electroencephalogram Recordings,"Jinzhao Zhou, Yiqun Duan, Ziyi Zhao, Yu-Cheng Chang, Yu-Kai Wang, Thomas Do, Chin-Teng Lin","Decoding linguistic information from non-invasive brain signals using EEG has gained increasing research attention due to its vast applicational potential. Recently, a number of works have adopted a generative-based framework to decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into sentences by utilizing the power generative capacity of pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, this approach has several drawbacks that hinder the further development of linguistic applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Specifically, the ability of the EEG encoder to learn semantic information from EEG data remains questionable, and the LLM decoder's tendency to generate sentences based on its training memory can be hard to avoid. These issues necessitate a novel approach for converting EEG signals into sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step pipeline that addresses these limitations and enhances the validity of linguistic EEG decoding research. We first confirm that word-level semantic information can be learned from EEG data recorded during natural reading by training a Conformer encoder via a masked contrastive objective for word-level classification. To achieve sentence decoding results, we employ a training-free retrieval method to retrieve sentences based on the predictions from the EEG encoder. Extensive experiments and ablation studies were conducted in this paper for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach. Visualization of the top prediction candidates reveals that our model effectively groups EEG segments into semantic categories with similar meanings, thereby validating its ability to learn patterns from unspoken EEG recordings. Despite the exploratory nature of this work, these results suggest that our method holds promise for providing more reliable solutions for converting EEG signals into text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04679v1,2024-08
CREST: Effectively Compacting a Datastore For Retrieval-Based Speculative Decoding,"Sophia Ho, Jinsol Park, Patrick Wang","We present CREST (Compact Retrieval-Based Speculative Decoding), a redesign of REST that allows it to be effectively ""compacted"". REST is a drafting technique for speculative decoding based on retrieving exact n-gram matches of the most recent n tokens generated by the target LLM from a datastore. The key idea of CREST is to only store a subset of the smallest and most common n-grams in the datastore with the hope of achieving comparable performance with less storage space. We found that storing a subset of n-grams both reduces storage space and improves performance. CREST matches REST's accepted token length with 10.6-13.5x less storage space and achieves a 16.5-17.1% higher acceptance length than REST using the same storage space on the HumanEval and MT Bench benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04678v1,2024-08

However, it remains unclear exactly what information is encoded in PLM hidden states. We investigate this practice by probing PLM representations using minimal orthographic noise. We expect that if CWEs primarily encode semantic information, a single character swap in the input word will not drastically affect the resulting representation,given sufficient linguistic context. Surprisingly, we find that CWEs generated by popular PLMs are highly sensitive to noise in input data, and that this sensitivity is related to subword tokenization: the fewer tokens used to represent a word at input, the more sensitive its corresponding CWE. This suggests that CWEs capture information unrelated to word-level meaning and can be manipulated through trivial modifications of input data. We conclude that these PLM-derived CWEs may not be reliable semantic proxies, and that caution is warranted when interpreting representational similarity",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04162v1,2024-08
UNLEARN Efficient Removal of Knowledge in Large Language Models,"Tyler Lizzo, Larry Heck","Given the prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and the prohibitive cost of training these models from scratch, dynamically forgetting specific knowledge e.g., private or proprietary, without retraining the model has become an important capability. This paper proposes a novel method to achieve this objective called UNLEARN. The approach builds upon subspace methods to identify and specifically target the removal of knowledge without adversely affecting other knowledge in the LLM. Results demonstrate 96% of targeted knowledge can be forgotten while maintaining performance on other knowledge within 2.5% of the original model, significantly outperforming the discriminatory abilities of the previous state-of-the-art. A dual method called LEARN is also proposed for targeted knowledge addition. Results show LEARN can match the fine-tuning accuracy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) without adversely affecting similar tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04140v1,2024-08
Enhancing Healthcare through Large Language Models: A Study on Medical Question Answering,"Haoran Yu, Chang Yu, Zihan Wang, Dongxian Zou, Hao Qin","In recent years, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has shown significant promise in improving the accessibility and dissemination of medical knowledge. This paper presents a detailed study of various LLMs trained on the MedQuAD medical question-answering dataset, with a focus on identifying the most effective model for providing accurate medical information. Among the models tested, the Sentence-t5 combined with Mistral 7B demonstrated superior performance, achieving a precision score of 0.762. This model's enhanced capabilities are attributed to its advanced pretraining techniques, robust architecture, and effective prompt construction methodologies.

Can Rule-Based Insights Enhance LLMs for Radiology Report Classification? Introducing the RadPrompt Methodology,"Panagiotis Fytas, Anna Breger, Ian Selby, Simon Baker, Shahab Shahipasand, Anna Korhonen","Developing imaging models capable of detecting pathologies from chest X-rays can be cost and time-prohibitive for large datasets as it requires supervision to attain state-of-the-art performance. Instead, labels extracted from radiology reports may serve as distant supervision since these are routinely generated as part of clinical practice. Despite their widespread use, current rule-based methods for label extraction rely on extensive rule sets that are limited in their robustness to syntactic variability. To alleviate these limitations, we introduce RadPert, a rule-based system that integrates an uncertainty-aware information schema with a streamlined set of rules, enhancing performance. Additionally, we have developed RadPrompt, a multi-turn prompting strategy that leverages RadPert to bolster the zero-shot predictive capabilities of large language models, achieving a statistically significant improvement in weighted average F1 score over GPT-4 Turbo. Most notably, RadPrompt surpasses both its underlying models, showcasing the synergistic potential of LLMs with rule-based models.

Patchview: LLM-Powered Worldbuilding with Generative Dust and Magnet Visualization,"John Joon Young Chung, Max Kreminski","Large language models (LLMs) can help writers build story worlds by generating world elements, such as factions, characters, and locations. However, making sense of many generated elements can be overwhelming. Moreover, if the user wants to precisely control aspects of generated elements that are difficult to specify verbally, prompting alone may be insufficient. We introduce Patchview, a customizable LLM-powered system that visually aids worldbuilding by allowing users to interact with story concepts and elements through the physical metaphor of magnets and dust. Elements in Patchview are visually dragged closer to concepts with high relevance, facilitating sensemaking. The user can also steer the generation with verbally elusive concepts by indicating the desired position of the element between concepts. When the user disagrees with the LLM's visualization and generation, they can correct those by repositioning the element. These corrections can be used to align the LLM's future behaviors to the user's perception. With a user study, we show that Patchview supports the sensemaking of world elements and steering of element generation, facilitating exploration during the worldbuilding process. Patchview provides insights on how customizable visual representation can help sensemake, steer, and align generative AI model behaviors with the user's intentions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04112v1,2024-08
Tree Attention: Topology-aware Decoding for Long-Context Attention on GPU clusters,"Vasudev Shyam, Jonathan Pilault, Emily Shepperd, Quentin Anthony, Beren Millidge","Self-attention is the core mathematical operation of modern transformer architectures and is also a significant computational bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity in the sequence length. In this work, we derive the scalar energy function whose gradient computes the self-attention block, thus elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of self-attention, providing a Bayesian interpretation of the operation and linking it closely with energy-based models such as Hopfield Networks. Our formulation reveals that the reduction across the sequence axis can be efficiently computed in parallel through a tree reduction. Our algorithm, for parallelizing attention computation across multiple GPUs enables cross-device decoding to be performed asymptotically faster (up to 8x faster in our experiments) than alternative approaches such as Ring Attention, while also requiring significantly less communication volume and incurring 2x less peak memory.

Human Speech Perception in Noise: Can Large Language Models Paraphrase to Improve It?,"Anupama Chingacham, Miaoran Zhang, Vera Demberg, Dietrich Klakow","Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate text by transferring style attributes like formality resulting in formal or informal text. However, instructing LLMs to generate text that when spoken, is more intelligible in an acoustically difficult environment, is an under-explored topic. We conduct the first study to evaluate LLMs on a novel task of generating acoustically intelligible paraphrases for better human speech perception in noise. Our experiments in English demonstrated that with standard prompting, LLMs struggle to control the non-textual attribute, i.e., acoustic intelligibility, while efficiently capturing the desired textual attributes like semantic equivalence. To remedy this issue, we propose a simple prompting approach, prompt-and-select, which generates paraphrases by decoupling the desired textual and non-textual attributes in the text generation pipeline. Our approach resulted in a 40% relative improvement in human speech perception, by paraphrasing utterances that are highly distorted in a listening condition with babble noise at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) -5 dB. This study reveals the limitation of LLMs in capturing non-textual attributes, and our proposed method showcases the potential of using LLMs for better human speech perception in noise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04029v1,2024-08

This paper presents a novel framework for contextual grounding in textual models, with a particular emphasis on the Context Representation stage. Our approach aims to enhance the reliability and ethical alignment of these models through a comprehensive, context-aware methodology. By explicitly capturing and representing relevant situational, cultural, and ethical contexts in a machine-readable format, we lay the foundation for anchoring a model's behavior within these contexts. Our approach leverages techniques from knowledge representation and reasoning, such as ontologies, semantic web technologies, and logic-based formalisms. We evaluate our framework on real-world textual datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving model performance, fairness, and alignment with human expectations, while maintaining high accuracy. Furthermore, we discuss the other key components of the framework, including context-aware encoding, context-aware learning, interpretability and explainability, and continuous monitoring and adaptation. This research contributes to the growing body of work on responsible AI, offering a practical approach to developing more reliable, trustworthy, and ethically-aligned language models.

MathBridge: A Large Corpus Dataset for Translating Spoken Mathematical Expressions into $LaTeX$ Formulas for Improved Readability,"Kyudan Jung, Sieun Hyeon, Jeong Youn Kwon, Nam-Joon Kim, Hyun Gon Ryu, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Jaeyoung Do","Improving the readability of mathematical expressions in text-based document such as subtitle of mathematical video, is an significant task. To achieve this, mathematical expressions should be convert to compiled formulas. For instance, the spoken expression ``x equals minus b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over two a'' from automatic speech recognition is more readily comprehensible when displayed as a compiled formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. To convert mathematical spoken sentences to compiled formulas, two processes are required: spoken sentences are converted into LaTeX formulas, and LaTeX formulas are converted into compiled formulas. The latter can be managed by using LaTeX engines. However, there is no way to do the former effectively. Even if we try to solve this using language models, there is no paired data between spoken sentences and LaTeX formulas to train it. In this paper, we introduce MathBridge, the first extensive dataset for translating mathematical spoken sentences into LaTeX formulas. MathBridge comprises approximately 23 million LaTeX formulas paired with the corresponding mathematical spoken sentences. Through comprehensive evaluations, including fine-tuning with proposed data, we discovered that MathBridge significantly enhances the capabilities of pretrained language models for converting to LaTeX formulas from mathematical spoken sentences.

However, substantial improvements are still needed for languages other than English, especially for specific domains like the applications of Mercosur Common Nomenclature (NCM), a Brazilian Harmonized System (HS). To address this gap, this study uses TeenyTineLLaMA, a foundational Portuguese LLM, as an LLM source to implement the NCM application processing. Additionally, a simplified Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) technique, termed SLIM-RAFT, is proposed for task-specific fine-tuning of LLMs. This approach retains the chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology for prompt development in a more concise and streamlined manner, utilizing brief and focused documents for training. The proposed model demonstrates an efficient and cost-effective alternative for fine-tuning smaller LLMs, significantly outperforming TeenyTineLLaMA and ChatGPT-4 in the same task.

From Words to Worth: Newborn Article Impact Prediction with LLM,"Penghai Zhao, Qinghua Xing, Kairan Dou, Jinyu Tian, Ying Tai, Jian Yang, Ming-Ming Cheng, Xiang Li","As the academic landscape expands, the challenge of efficiently identifying impactful newly published articles grows increasingly vital. This paper introduces a promising approach, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to predict the future impact of newborn articles solely based on titles and abstracts. Moving beyond traditional methods heavily reliant on external information, the proposed method employs LLM to discern the shared semantic features of highly impactful papers from a large collection of title-abstract pairs. These semantic features are further utilized to predict the proposed indicator, TNCSI_SP, which incorporates favorable normalization properties across value, field, and time. To facilitate parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the LLM, we have also meticulously curated a dataset containing over 12,000 entries, each annotated with titles, abstracts, and their corresponding TNCSI_SP values. The quantitative results, with an MAE of 0.216 and an NDCG@20 of 0.901, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting the impact of newborn articles when compared to several promising methods. Finally, we present a real-world application example for predicting the impact of newborn journal articles to demonstrate its noteworthy practical value.

Editable Fairness: Fine-Grained Bias Mitigation in Language Models,"Ruizhe Chen, Yichen Li, Jianfei Yang, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Zuozhu Liu","Generating fair and accurate predictions plays a pivotal role in deploying large language models (LLMs) in the real world. However, existing debiasing methods inevitably generate unfair or incorrect predictions as they are designed and evaluated to achieve parity across different social groups but leave aside individual commonsense facts, resulting in modified knowledge that elicits unreasonable or undesired predictions. In this paper, we first establish a new bias mitigation benchmark, BiaScope, which systematically assesses performance by leveraging newly constructed datasets and metrics on knowledge retention and generalization. Then, we propose a novel debiasing approach, Fairness Stamp (FAST), which enables fine-grained calibration of individual social biases. FAST identifies the decisive layer responsible for storing social biases and then calibrates its outputs by integrating a small modular network, considering both bias mitigation and knowledge-preserving demands. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FAST surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with superior debiasing performance while not compromising the overall model capability for knowledge retention and downstream predictions. This highlights the potential of fine-grained debiasing strategies to achieve fairness in LLMs. Code will be publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11843v1,2024-08
CodexGraph: Bridging Large Language Models and Code Repositories via Code Graph Databases,"Xiangyan Liu, Bo Lan, Zhiyuan Hu, Yang Liu, Zhicheng Zhang, Fei Wang, Michael Shieh, Wenmeng Zhou","Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in stand-alone code tasks like HumanEval and MBPP, but struggle with handling entire code repositories. This challenge has prompted research on enhancing LLM-codebase interaction at a repository scale. Current solutions rely on similarity-based retrieval or manual tools and APIs, each with notable drawbacks. Similarity-based retrieval often has low recall in complex tasks, while manual tools and APIs are typically task-specific and require expert knowledge, reducing their generalizability across diverse code tasks and real-world applications. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce CodexGraph, a system that integrates LLM agents with graph database interfaces extracted from code repositories. By leveraging the structural properties of graph databases and the flexibility of the graph query language, CodexGraph enables the LLM agent to construct and execute queries, allowing for precise, code structure-aware context retrieval and code navigation. We assess CodexGraph using three benchmarks: CrossCodeEval, SWE-bench, and EvoCodeBench. Additionally, we develop five real-world coding applications.

Bias evaluation metrics lack standards as well as consensus and existing methods often rely on human-generated templates and annotations which are expensive and labor intensive. In this work, we train models to automatically create adversarial prompts to elicit biased responses from target LLMs. We present LLM- based bias evaluation metrics and also analyze several existing automatic evaluation methods and metrics.

Simplifying Scholarly Abstracts for Accessible Digital Libraries,"Haining Wang, Jason Clark","Standing at the forefront of knowledge dissemination, digital libraries curate vast collections of scientific literature. However, these scholarly writings are often laden with jargon and tailored for domain experts rather than the general public. As librarians, we strive to offer services to a diverse audience, including those with lower reading levels. To extend our services beyond mere access, we propose fine-tuning a language model to rewrite scholarly abstracts into more comprehensible versions, thereby making scholarly literature more accessible when requested. We began by introducing a corpus specifically designed for training models to simplify scholarly abstracts. This corpus consists of over three thousand pairs of abstracts and significance statements from diverse disciplines. We then fine-tuned four language models using this corpus. The outputs from the models were subsequently examined both quantitatively for accessibility and semantic coherence, and qualitatively for language quality, faithfulness, and completeness. Our findings show that the resulting models can improve readability by over three grade levels, while maintaining fidelity to the original content. Although commercial state-of-the-art models still hold an edge, our models are much more compact, can be deployed locally in an affordable manner, and alleviate the privacy concerns associated with using commercial models.

This paper introduces a counterfactual data augmentation approach to AL, particularly addressing the selection of datapoints for user querying, a pivotal concern in enhancing data efficiency. Our approach is inspired by Variation Theory, a theory of human concept learning that emphasizes the essential features of a concept by focusing on what stays the same and what changes. Instead of just querying with existing datapoints, our approach synthesizes artificial datapoints that highlight potential key similarities and differences among labels using a neuro-symbolic pipeline combining large language models (LLMs) and rule-based models.

We propose a novel pipeline that combines vector databases, transformer-based encoders, and GLMs to enhance short answer scoring accuracy. Our approach stores training responses in a vector database, retrieves semantically similar responses during inference, and employs a GLM to analyze these responses and determine appropriate scores. We further optimize the system through fine-tuned retrieval processes and prompt engineering. Evaluation on the SemEval 2013 dataset demonstrates a significant improvement on the SCIENTSBANK 3-way and 2-way tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of GLMs in advancing ASAS technology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03811v1,2024-08
Prompt and Prejudice,"Lorenzo Berlincioni, Luca Cultrera, Federico Becattini, Marco Bertini, Alberto Del Bimbo","This paper investigates the impact of using first names in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly when prompted with ethical decision-making tasks. We propose an approach that appends first names to ethically annotated text scenarios to reveal demographic biases in model outputs. Our study involves a curated list of more than 300 names representing diverse genders and ethnic backgrounds, tested across thousands of moral scenarios. Following the auditing methodologies from social sciences we propose a detailed analysis involving popular LLMs/VLMs to contribute to the field of responsible AI by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and mitigating biases in these systems. Furthermore, we introduce a novel benchmark, the Pratical Scenarios Benchmark (PSB), designed to assess the presence of biases involving gender or demographic prejudices in everyday decision-making scenarios as well as practical scenarios where an LLM might be used to make sensible decisions (e.g., granting mortgages or insurances). This benchmark allows for a comprehensive comparison of model behaviors across different demographic categories, highlighting the risks and biases that may arise in practical applications of LLMs and VLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04671v1,2024-08

Question Rephrasing for Quantifying Uncertainty in Large Language Models: Applications in Molecular Chemistry Tasks,"Zizhang Chen, Pengyu Hong, Sandeep Madireddy","Uncertainty quantification enables users to assess the reliability of responses generated by large language models (LLMs). We present a novel Question Rephrasing technique to evaluate the input uncertainty of LLMs, which refers to the uncertainty arising from equivalent variations of the inputs provided to LLMs. This technique is integrated with sampling methods that measure the output uncertainty of LLMs, thereby offering a more comprehensive uncertainty assessment. We validated our approach on property prediction and reaction prediction for molecular chemistry tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03732v1,2024-08

While these tools provide opportunities for improved teaching and education, they also pose significant challenges for assessment and learning outcomes. We conceptualize these challenges through the lens of vulnerability, the potential for university assessments and learning outcomes to be impacted by student use of generative AI. We investigate the potential scale of this vulnerability by measuring the degree to which AI assistants can complete assessment questions in standard university-level STEM courses. Specifically, we compile a novel dataset of textual assessment questions from 50 courses at EPFL and evaluate whether two AI assistants, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adequately answer these questions. We use eight prompting strategies to produce responses and find that GPT-4 answers an average of 65.8% of questions correctly, and can even produce the correct answer across at least one prompting strategy for 85.1% of questions. When grouping courses in our dataset by degree program, these systems already pass non-project assessments of large numbers of core courses in various degree programs, posing risks to higher education accreditation that will be amplified as these models improve. Our results call for revising program-level assessment design in higher education in light of advances in generative AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11841v2,2024-08
Local Topology Measures of Contextual Language Model Latent Spaces With Applications to Dialogue Term Extraction,"Benjamin Matthias Ruppik, Michael Heck, Carel van Niekerk, Renato Vukovic, Hsien-chin Lin, Shutong Feng, Marcus Zibrowius, Milica Gašić","A common approach for sequence tagging tasks based on contextual word representations is to train a machine learning classifier directly on these embedding vectors. This approach has two shortcomings. First, such methods consider single input sequences in isolation and are unable to put an individual embedding vector in relation to vectors outside the current local context of use. Second, the high performance of these models relies on fine-tuning the embedding model in conjunction with the classifier, which may not always be feasible due to the size or inaccessibility of the underlying feature-generation model. It is thus desirable, given a collection of embedding vectors of a corpus, i.e., a datastore, to find features of each vector that describe its relation to other, similar vectors in the datastore. With this in mind, we introduce complexity measures of the local topology of the latent space of a contextual language model with respect to a given datastore. The effectiveness of our features is demonstrated through their application to dialogue term extraction. Our work continues a line of research that explores the manifold hypothesis for word embeddings, demonstrating that local structure in the space carved out by word embeddings can be exploited to infer semantic properties.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03706v1,2024-08
NACL: A General and Effective KV Cache Eviction Framework for LLMs at Inference Time,"Yilong Chen, Guoxia Wang, Junyuan Shang, Shiyao Cui, Zhenyu Zhang, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Dianhai Yu, Hua Wu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance.

mucAI at WojoodNER 2024: Arabic Named Entity Recognition with Nearest Neighbor Search,"Ahmed Abdou, Tasneem Mohsen","Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. However, when applied to Arabic data, NER encounters unique challenges stemming from the language's rich morphological inflections, absence of capitalization cues, and spelling variants, where a single word can comprise multiple morphemes. In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the Wojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the shared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained flat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity and possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER augments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label probability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached training data.

CARE: A Clue-guided Assistant for CSRs to Read User Manuals,"Weihong Du, Jia Liu, Zujie Wen, Dingnan Jin, Hongru Liang, Wenqiang Lei","It is time-saving to build a reading assistant for customer service representations (CSRs) when reading user manuals, especially information-rich ones. Current solutions don't fit the online custom service scenarios well due to the lack of attention to user questions and possible responses. Hence, we propose to develop a time-saving and careful reading assistant for CSRs, named CARE. It can help the CSRs quickly find proper responses from the user manuals via explicit clue chains. Specifically, each of the clue chains is formed by inferring over the user manuals, starting from the question clue aligned with the user question and ending at a possible response. To overcome the shortage of supervised data, we adopt the self-supervised strategy for model learning. The offline experiment shows that CARE is efficient in automatically inferring accurate responses from the user manual. The online experiment further demonstrates the superiority of CARE to reduce CSRs' reading burden and keep high service quality, in particular with >35% decrease in time spent and keeping a >0.75 ICC score.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03633v3,2024-08
Large Language Model as a Catalyst: A Paradigm Shift in Base Station Siting Optimization,"Yanhu Wang, Muhammad Muzammil Afzal, Zhengyang Li, Jie Zhou, Chenyuan Feng, Shuaishuai Guo, Tony Q. S. Quek","Traditional base station siting (BSS) methods rely heavily on drive testing and user feedback, which are laborious and require extensive expertise in communication, networking, and optimization. As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. Furthermore, our proposed framework incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance the system's ability to acquire domain-specific knowledge and generate solutions, thereby enabling the customization and optimization of the BSS process. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. This research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes three different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03631v2,2024-08
PAGED: A Benchmark for Procedural Graphs Extraction from Documents,"Weihong Du, Wenrui Liao, Hongru Liang, Wenqiang Lei","Automatic extraction of procedural graphs from documents creates a low-cost way for users to easily understand a complex procedure by skimming visual graphs. Despite the progress in recent studies, it remains unanswered: whether the existing studies have well solved this task (Q1) and whether the emerging large language models (LLMs) can bring new opportunities to this task (Q2). To this end, we propose a new benchmark PAGED, equipped with a large high-quality dataset and standard evaluations. It investigates five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing that they fail to extract optimal procedural graphs well because of their heavy reliance on hand-written rules and limited available data. We further involve three advanced LLMs in PAGED and enhance them with a novel self-refine strategy. The results point out the advantages of LLMs in identifying textual elements and their gaps in building logical structures. We hope PAGED can serve as a major landmark for automatic procedural graph extraction and the investigations in PAGED can offer insights into the research on logic reasoning among non-sequential elements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03630v2,2024-08
Improving the quality of Persian clinical text with a novel spelling correction system,"Seyed Mohammad Sadegh Dashti, Seyedeh Fatemeh Dashti","Background: The accuracy of spelling in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a critical factor for efficient clinical care, research, and ensuring patient safety. The Persian language, with its abundant vocabulary and complex characteristics, poses unique challenges for real-word error correction. This research aimed to develop an innovative approach for detecting and correcting spelling errors in Persian clinical text.   Methods: Our strategy employs a state-of-the-art pre-trained model that has been meticulously fine-tuned specifically for the task of spelling correction in the Persian clinical domain. This model is complemented by an innovative orthographic similarity matching algorithm, PERTO, which uses visual similarity of characters for ranking correction candidates.   Results: The evaluation of our approach demonstrated its robustness and precision in detecting and rectifying word errors in Persian clinical text. In terms of non-word error correction, our model achieved an F1-Score of 90.0% when the PERTO algorithm was employed. For real-word error detection, our model demonstrated its highest performance, achieving an F1-Score of 90.6%. Furthermore, the model reached its highest F1-Score of 91.5% for real-word error correction when the PERTO algorithm was employed.   Conclusions: Despite certain limitations, our method represents a substantial advancement in the field of spelling error detection and correction for Persian clinical text. By effectively addressing the unique challenges posed by the Persian language, our approach paves the way for more accurate and efficient clinical documentation, contributing to improved patient care and safety.

A Logical Fallacy-Informed Framework for Argument Generation,"Luca Mouchel, Debjit Paul, Shaobo Cui, Robert West, Antoine Bosselut, Boi Faltings","Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing tasks, they still struggle with generating logically sound arguments, resulting in potential risks such as spreading misinformation. To address this issue, we introduce FIPO, a fallacy-informed framework that leverages preference optimization methods to steer LLMs toward logically sound arguments. FIPO includes a classification loss, to capture the fine-grained information on fallacy types. Our results on argumentation datasets show that our method reduces the fallacy errors by up to 17.5%. Furthermore, our human evaluation results indicate that the quality of the generated arguments by our method significantly outperforms the fine-tuned baselines, as well as other preference optimization methods, such as DPO. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring models are aware of logical fallacies for effective argument generation.

Is Child-Directed Speech Effective Training Data for Language Models?,"Steven Y. Feng, Noah D. Goodman, Michael C. Frank","While high-performing language models are typically trained on hundreds of billions of words, human children become fluent language users with a much smaller amount of data. What are the features of the data they receive, and how do these features support language modeling objectives? To investigate this question, we train GPT-2 and RoBERTa models on 29M words of English child-directed speech and a new matched, synthetic dataset (TinyDialogues), comparing to OpenSubtitles, Wikipedia, and a heterogeneous blend of datasets from the BabyLM challenge. We evaluate the syntactic and semantic knowledge of these models using developmentally-inspired evaluations. Through pretraining experiments, we test whether the global developmental ordering or the local discourse ordering of children's training data supports high performance relative to other datasets. The local properties of the data affect model results, but surprisingly, global properties do not. Further, child language input is not uniquely valuable for training language models. These findings support the hypothesis that, rather than proceeding from better data, the child's learning algorithm is substantially more data-efficient than current language modeling techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03617v2,2024-08
Optimus-1: Hybrid Multimodal Memory Empowered Agents Excel in Long-Horizon Tasks,"Zaijing Li, Yuquan Xie, Rui Shao, Gongwei Chen, Dongmei Jiang, Liqiang Nie","Building a general-purpose agent is a long-standing vision in the field of artificial intelligence. Existing agents have made remarkable progress in many domains, yet they still struggle to complete long-horizon tasks in an open world. We attribute this to the lack of necessary world knowledge and multimodal experience that can guide agents through a variety of long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Multimodal Memory module to address the above challenges. It 1) transforms knowledge into Hierarchical Directed Knowledge Graph that allows agents to explicitly represent and learn world knowledge, and 2) summarises historical information into Abstracted Multimodal Experience Pool that provide agents with rich references for in-context learning. On top of the Hybrid Multimodal Memory module, a multimodal agent, Optimus-1, is constructed with dedicated Knowledge-guided Planner and Experience-Driven Reflector, contributing to a better planning and reflection in the face of long-horizon tasks in Minecraft. Extensive experimental results show that Optimus-1 significantly outperforms all existing agents on challenging long-horizon task benchmarks, and exhibits near human-level performance on many tasks. In addition, we introduce various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as the backbone of Optimus-1. Experimental results show that Optimus-1 exhibits strong generalization with the help of the Hybrid Multimodal Memory module, outperforming the GPT-4V baseline on many tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03615v2,2024-08
EnJa: Ensemble Jailbreak on Large Language Models,"Jiahao Zhang, Zilong Wang, Ruofan Wang, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang","As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in safety-critical applications, their vulnerability to potential jailbreaks -- malicious prompts that can disable the safety mechanism of LLMs -- has attracted growing research attention. While alignment methods have been proposed to protect LLMs from jailbreaks, many have found that aligned LLMs can still be jailbroken by carefully crafted malicious prompts, producing content that violates policy regulations. Existing jailbreak attacks on LLMs can be categorized into prompt-level methods which make up stories/logic to circumvent safety alignment and token-level attack methods which leverage gradient methods to find adversarial tokens. In this work, we introduce the concept of Ensemble Jailbreak and explore methods that can integrate prompt-level and token-level jailbreak into a more powerful hybrid jailbreak attack. Specifically, we propose a novel EnJa attack to hide harmful instructions using prompt-level jailbreak, boost the attack success rate using a gradient-based attack, and connect the two types of jailbreak attacks via a template-based connector. We evaluate the effectiveness of EnJa on several aligned models and show that it achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate with fewer queries and is much stronger than any individual jailbreak.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03603v1,2024-08
Teach CLIP to Develop a Number Sense for Ordinal Regression,"Yao Du, Qiang Zhai, Weihang Dai, Xiaomeng Li","Ordinal regression is a fundamental problem within the field of computer vision, with customised well-trained models on specific tasks. While pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive performance on various vision tasks, their potential for ordinal regression has received less exploration. In this study, we first investigate CLIP's potential for ordinal regression, from which we expect the model could generalise to different ordinal regression tasks and scenarios. Unfortunately, vanilla CLIP fails on this task, since current VLMs have a well-documented limitation of encapsulating compositional concepts such as number sense. We propose a simple yet effective method called NumCLIP to improve the quantitative understanding of VLMs. We disassemble the exact image to number-specific text matching problem into coarse classification and fine prediction stages. We discretize and phrase each numerical bin with common language concept to better leverage the available pre-trained alignment in CLIP. To consider the inherent continuous property of ordinal regression, we propose a novel fine-grained cross-modal ranking-based regularisation loss specifically designed to keep both semantic and ordinal alignment in CLIP's feature space. Experimental results on three general ordinal regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of NumCLIP, with 10% and 3.83% accuracy improvement on historical image dating and image aesthetics assessment task, respectively.

Active Testing of Large Language Model via Multi-Stage Sampling,"Yuheng Huang, Jiayang Song, Qiang Hu, Felix Juefei-Xu, Lei Ma","Performance evaluation plays a crucial role in the development life cycle of large language models (LLMs). It estimates the model's capability, elucidates behavior characteristics, and facilitates the identification of potential issues and limitations, thereby guiding further improvement. Given that LLMs' diverse task-handling abilities stem from large volumes of training data, a comprehensive evaluation also necessitates abundant, well-annotated, and representative test data to assess LLM performance across various downstream tasks. However, the demand for high-quality test data often entails substantial time, computational resources, and manual efforts, sometimes causing the evaluation to be inefficient or impractical. To address these challenges, researchers propose active testing, which estimates the overall performance by selecting a subset of test data. Nevertheless, the existing active testing methods tend to be inefficient, even inapplicable, given the unique new challenges of LLMs (e.g., diverse task types, increased model complexity, and unavailability of training data). To mitigate such limitations and expedite the development cycle of LLMs, in this work, we introduce AcTracer, an active testing framework tailored for LLMs that strategically selects a small subset of test data to achieve a nearly optimal performance estimation for LLMs. AcTracer utilizes both internal and external information from LLMs to guide the test sampling process, reducing variance through a multi-stage pool-based active selection. Our experiment results demonstrate that AcTracer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods across various tasks, with up to 38.83% improvement over previous SOTA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03573v1,2024-08
Unlocking Exocentric Video-Language Data for Egocentric Video Representation Learning,"Zi-Yi Dou, Xitong Yang, Tushar Nagarajan, Huiyu Wang, Jing Huang, Nanyun Peng, Kris Kitani, Fu-Jen Chu","We present EMBED (Egocentric Models Built with Exocentric Data), a method designed to transform exocentric video-language data for egocentric video representation learning. Large-scale exocentric data covers diverse activities with significant potential for egocentric learning, but inherent disparities between egocentric and exocentric data pose challenges in utilizing one view for the other seamlessly. Egocentric videos predominantly feature close-up hand-object interactions, whereas exocentric videos offer a broader perspective on human activities. Additionally, narratives in egocentric datasets are typically more action-centric and closely linked with the visual content, in contrast to the narrative styles found in exocentric datasets. To address these challenges, we employ a data transformation framework to adapt exocentric data for egocentric training, focusing on identifying specific video clips that emphasize hand-object interactions and transforming narration styles to align with egocentric perspectives. By applying both vision and language style transfer, our framework creates a new egocentric dataset derived from exocentric video-language data. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EMBED, achieving state-of-the-art results across various egocentric downstream tasks, including an absolute improvement of 4.7% on the Epic-Kitchens-100 multi-instance retrieval and 6.2% on the EGTEA classification benchmarks in zero-shot settings. Furthermore, EMBED enables egocentric video-language models to perform competitively in exocentric tasks. Finally, we showcase EMBED's application across various exocentric datasets, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities when applied to different exocentric datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03567v1,2024-08
A Comparison of LLM Finetuning Methods & Evaluation Metrics with Travel Chatbot Use Case,"Sonia Meyer, Shreya Singh, Bertha Tam, Christopher Ton, Angel Ren","This research compares large language model (LLM) fine-tuning methods, including Quantized Low Rank Adapter (QLoRA), Retrieval Augmented fine-tuning (RAFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and additionally compared LLM evaluation methods including End to End (E2E) benchmark method of ""Golden Answers"", traditional natural language processing (NLP) metrics, RAG Assessment (Ragas), OpenAI GPT-4 evaluation metrics, and human evaluation, using the travel chatbot use case. The travel dataset was sourced from the the Reddit API by requesting posts from travel-related subreddits to get travel-related conversation prompts and personalized travel experiences, and augmented for each fine-tuning method. We used two pretrained LLMs utilized for fine-tuning research: LLaMa 2 7B, and Mistral 7B. QLoRA and RAFT are applied to the two pretrained models. The inferences from these models are extensively evaluated against the aforementioned metrics. The best model according to human evaluation and some GPT-4 metrics was Mistral RAFT, so this underwent a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training pipeline, and ultimately was evaluated as the best model. Our main findings are that: 1) quantitative and Ragas metrics do not align with human evaluation, 2) Open AI GPT-4 evaluation most aligns with human evaluation, 3) it is essential to keep humans in the loop for evaluation because, 4) traditional NLP metrics insufficient, 5) Mistral generally outperformed LLaMa, 6) RAFT outperforms QLoRA, but still needs postprocessing, 7) RLHF improves model performance significantly. Next steps include improving data quality, increasing data quantity, exploring RAG methods, and focusing data collection on a specific city, which would improve data quality by narrowing the focus, while creating a useful product.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03562v1,2024-08

We propose a new VPI method, ""goal hijacking via visual prompt injection"" (GHVPI), that swaps the execution task of LVLMs from an original task to an alternative task designated by an attacker. The quantitative analysis indicates that GPT-4V is vulnerable to the GHVPI and demonstrates a notable attack success rate of 15.8%, which is an unignorable security risk.

NatLan: Native Language Prompting Facilitates Knowledge Elicitation Through Language Trigger Provision and Domain Trigger Retention,"Baixuan Li, Yunlong Fan, Tianyi Ma, Zhiqiang Gao","Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) do not perform as well when answering questions in non-dominant languages as they do in their dominant languages. Although existing translate-then-answer methods alleviate this issue, the mechanisms behind their effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we analogize the dominant language of MLLMs to the native language of humans and use two human cognitive features: the Language Trigger (LT) and the Domain Trigger (DT), to interpret the mechanisms behind translate-then-answer methods. This reveals that while sufficient LTs are provided by these methods, there remains a deficiency in DT retention. To mitigate this issue, we propose Native Language Prompting (NatLan), employing a Multi-MLLM collaboration strategy and introducing an additional role-enhanced domain-specific MLLM with stronger multilingual understanding capabilities as the translator. Across five language QA benchmarks, NatLan achieves up to a 31.28% improvement in accuracy and, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, provides comparable or greater retention of DTs in up to 87% of cases.

EgyBERT: A Large Language Model Pretrained on Egyptian Dialect Corpora,Faisal Qarah,"This study presents EgyBERT, an Arabic language model pretrained on 10.4 GB of Egyptian dialectal texts. We evaluated EgyBERT's performance by comparing it with five other multidialect Arabic language models across 10 evaluation datasets. EgyBERT achieved the highest average F1-score of 84.25% and an accuracy of 87.33%, significantly outperforming all other comparative models, with MARBERTv2 as the second best model achieving an F1-score 83.68% and an accuracy 87.19%. Additionally, we introduce two novel Egyptian dialectal corpora: the Egyptian Tweets Corpus (ETC), containing over 34.33 million tweets (24.89 million sentences) amounting to 2.5 GB of text, and the Egyptian Forums Corpus (EFC), comprising over 44.42 million sentences (7.9 GB of text) collected from various Egyptian online forums. Both corpora are used in pretraining the new model, and they are the largest Egyptian dialectal corpora to date reported in the literature.

MoExtend: Tuning New Experts for Modality and Task Extension,"Shanshan Zhong, Shanghua Gao, Zhongzhan Huang, Wushao Wen, Marinka Zitnik, Pan Zhou","Large language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks but are primarily trained on text data, limiting their application scope. Expanding LLM capabilities to include vision-language understanding is vital, yet training them on multimodal data from scratch is challenging and costly. Existing instruction tuning methods, e.g., LLAVA, often connects a pretrained CLIP vision encoder and LLMs via fully fine-tuning LLMs to bridge the modality gap. However, full fine-tuning is plagued by catastrophic forgetting, i.e., forgetting previous knowledge, and high training costs particularly in the era of increasing tasks and modalities. To solve this issue, we introduce MoExtend, an effective framework designed to streamline the modality adaptation and extension of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. MoExtend seamlessly integrates new experts into pre-trained MoE models, endowing them with novel knowledge without the need to tune pretrained models such as MoE and vision encoders. This approach enables rapid adaptation and extension to new modal data or tasks, effectively addressing the challenge of accommodating new modalities within LLMs. Furthermore, MoExtend avoids tuning pretrained models, thus mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of MoExtend in enhancing the multimodal capabilities of LLMs, contributing to advancements in multimodal AI research.

"1.5-Pints Technical Report: Pretraining in Days, Not Months -- Your Language Model Thrives on Quality Data","Calvin Tan, Jerome Wang","This paper presents a compute-efficient approach to pre-training a Language Model-the ""1.5-Pints""-in only 9 days, while outperforming state-of-the-art models as an instruction-following assistant.Based on MT-Bench (a benchmark that emulates human judgments), 1.5-Pints outperforms Apple's OpenELM and Microsoft's Phi.This is achieved by a carefully curated pre-training dataset of 57 billion tokens, using a mix of automated workflows and manual human review. The selection of the dataset prioritizes content that is considered expository and ""textbook-like"" to aid the model in reasoning and logical deduction, culminating in its overall ability as a strong and versatile AI model. In terms of the model architecture, we employed a modified Mistral tokenizer, alongside a Llama-2 architecture for wider compatibility. For training, we adopted the methodologies used by StableLM, TinyLlama, and Huggingface Zephyr. 1.5-Pints demonstrates that by focusing on data quality over quantity in LLM training, we can significantly reduce training time and resources required. We believe this approach will not only make pre-training more accessible but also reduce our carbon footprint. Our findings and resources from this research are open-sourced, aiming to facilitate further advancements in the field. The 1.5-Pints model is available in two versions: 2K and 16K context windows.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03506v1,2024-08
Optimus: Accelerating Large-Scale Multi-Modal LLM Training by Bubble Exploitation,"Weiqi Feng, Yangrui Chen, Shaoyu Wang, Yanghua Peng, Haibin Lin, Minlan Yu","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended the success of large language models (LLMs) to multiple data types, such as image, text and audio, achieving significant performance in various domains, including multimodal translation, visual question answering and content generation. Nonetheless, existing systems are inefficient to train MLLMs due to substantial GPU bubbles caused by the heterogeneous modality models and complex data dependencies in 3D parallelism. This paper proposes Optimus, a distributed MLLM training system that reduces end-to-end MLLM training time. Optimus is based on our principled analysis that scheduling the encoder computation within the LLM bubbles can reduce bubbles in MLLM training. To make scheduling encoder computation possible for all GPUs, Optimus searches the separate parallel plans for encoder and LLM, and adopts a bubble scheduling algorithm to enable exploiting LLM bubbles without breaking the original data dependencies in the MLLM model architecture. We further decompose encoder layer computation into a series of kernels, and analyze the common bubble pattern of 3D parallelism to carefully optimize the sub-millisecond bubble scheduling, minimizing the overall training time. Our experiments in a production cluster show that Optimus accelerates MLLM training by 20.5%-21.3% with ViT-22B and GPT-175B model over 3072 GPUs compared to baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03505v1,2024-08
Forecasting Live Chat Intent from Browsing History,"Se-eun Yoon, Ahmad Bin Rabiah, Zaid Alibadi, Surya Kallumadi, Julian McAuley","Customers reach out to online live chat agents with various intents, such as asking about product details or requesting a return. In this paper, we propose the problem of predicting user intent from browsing history and address it through a two-stage approach. The first stage classifies a user's browsing history into high-level intent categories. Here, we represent each browsing history as a text sequence of page attributes and use the ground-truth class labels to fine-tune pretrained Transformers. The second stage provides a large language model (LLM) with the browsing history and predicted intent class to generate fine-grained intents. For automatic evaluation, we use a separate LLM to judge the similarity between generated and ground-truth intents, which closely aligns with human judgments. Our two-stage approach yields significant performance gains compared to generating intents without the classification stage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04668v2,2024-08
Automated Theorem Provers Help Improve Large Language Model Reasoning,"Lachlan McGinness, Peter Baumgartner","In this paper we demonstrate how logic programming systems and Automated first-order logic Theorem Provers (ATPs) can improve the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) for logical reasoning tasks where the baseline performance is given by direct LLM solutions. We first evaluate LLM reasoning on steamroller problems using the PRONTOQA benchmark. We show how accuracy can be improved with a neuro-symbolic architecture where the LLM acts solely as a front-end for translating a given problem into a formal logic language and an automated reasoning engine is called for solving it. However, this approach critically hinges on the correctness of the LLM translation. To assess this translation correctness, we secondly define a framework of syntactic and semantic error categories. We implemented the framework and used it to identify errors that LLMs make in the benchmark domain. Based on these findings, we thirdly extended our method with capabilities for automatically correcting syntactic and semantic errors. For semantic error correction we integrate first-order logic ATPs, which is our main and novel contribution. We demonstrate that this approach reduces semantic errors significantly and further increases the accurracy of LLM logical reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03492v1,2024-08
"Logistic Regression makes small LLMs strong and explainable ""tens-of-shot"" classifiers","Marcus Buckmann, Edward Hill","For simple classification tasks, we show that users can benefit from the advantages of using small, local, generative language models instead of large commercial models without a trade-off in performance or introducing extra labelling costs. These advantages, including those around privacy, availability, cost, and explainability, are important both in commercial applications and in the broader democratisation of AI. Through experiments on 17 sentence classification tasks (2-4 classes), we show that penalised logistic regression on the embeddings from a small LLM equals (and usually betters) the performance of a large LLM in the ""tens-of-shot"" regime. This requires no more labelled instances than are needed to validate the performance of the large LLM. Finally, we extract stable and sensible explanations for classification decisions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03414v2,2024-08
ULLME: A Unified Framework for Large Language Model Embeddings with Generation-Augmented Learning,"Hieu Man, Nghia Trung Ngo, Franck Dernoncourt, Thien Huu Nguyen","Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing tasks, but leveraging them for dense passage embedding remains challenging. This is due to their causal attention mechanism and the misalignment between their pre-training objectives and the text ranking tasks. Despite some recent efforts to address these issues, existing frameworks for LLM-based text embeddings have been limited by their support for only a limited range of LLM architectures and fine-tuning strategies, limiting their practical application and versatility. In this work, we introduce the Unified framework for Large Language Model Embedding (ULLME), a flexible, plug-and-play implementation that enables bidirectional attention across various LLMs and supports a range of fine-tuning strategies. We also propose Generation-augmented Representation Learning (GRL), a novel fine-tuning method to boost LLMs for text embedding tasks. GRL enforces consistency between representation-based and generation-based relevance scores, leveraging LLMs' powerful generative abilities for learning passage embeddings. To showcase our framework's flexibility and effectiveness, we release three pre-trained models from ULLME with different backbone architectures, ranging from 1.5B to 8B parameters, all of which demonstrate strong performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark. Our framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/ullme. A demo video for ULLME can also be found at https://rb.gy/ws1ile.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03402v1,2024-08

At the same time, LMs are being used to tackle complex queries that require reasoning. We introduce CoverBench, a challenging benchmark focused on verifying LM outputs in complex reasoning settings. Datasets that can be used for this purpose are often designed for other complex reasoning tasks (e.g., QA) targeting specific use-cases (e.g., financial tables), requiring transformations, negative sampling and selection of hard examples to collect such a benchmark. CoverBench provides a diversified evaluation for complex claim verification in a variety of domains, types of reasoning, relatively long inputs, and a variety of standardizations, such as multiple representations for tables where available, and a consistent schema.

Training LLMs to Recognize Hedges in Spontaneous Narratives,"Amie J. Paige, Adil Soubki, John Murzaku, Owen Rambow, Susan E. Brennan","Hedges allow speakers to mark utterances as provisional, whether to signal non-prototypicality or ""fuzziness"", to indicate a lack of commitment to an utterance, to attribute responsibility for a statement to someone else, to invite input from a partner, or to soften critical feedback in the service of face-management needs. Here we focus on hedges in an experimentally parameterized corpus of 63 Roadrunner cartoon narratives spontaneously produced from memory by 21 speakers for co-present addressees, transcribed to text (Galati and Brennan, 2010). We created a gold standard of hedges annotated by human coders (the Roadrunner-Hedge corpus) and compared three LLM-based approaches for hedge detection: fine-tuning BERT, and zero and few-shot prompting with GPT-4o and LLaMA-3. The best-performing approach was a fine-tuned BERT model, followed by few-shot GPT-4o. After an error analysis on the top performing approaches, we used an LLM-in-the-Loop approach to improve the gold standard coding, as well as to highlight cases in which hedges are ambiguous in linguistically interesting ways that will guide future research. This is the first step in our research program to train LLMs to interpret and generate collateral signals appropriately and meaningfully in conversation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03319v1,2024-08
Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally can be More Effective than Scaling Model Parameters,"Charlie Snell, Jaehoon Lee, Kelvin Xu, Aviral Kumar","Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation is a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt? Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation motivates applying a ""compute-optimal"" scaling strategy, which acts to most effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14x larger model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03314v1,2024-08
KnowPO: Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization for Controllable Knowledge Selection in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models,"Ruizhe Zhang, Yongxin Xu, Yuzhen Xiao, Runchuan Zhu, Xinke Jiang, Xu Chu, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang","By integrating external knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an effective strategy for mitigating the hallucination problems that large language models (LLMs) encounter when dealing with knowledge-intensive tasks. However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric supporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge conflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance the knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused on refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless, due to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives, models fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors such as contextual ignorance and contextual overinclusion. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization strategy, dubbed KnowPO, aimed at achieving adaptive knowledge selection based on contextual relevance in real retrieval scenarios. Concretely, we proposed a general paradigm for constructing knowledge conflict datasets, which comprehensively cover various error types and learn how to avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods. Simultaneously, we proposed a rewriting strategy and data ratio optimization strategy to address preference imbalances. Experimental results show that KnowPO outperforms previous methods for handling knowledge conflicts by over 37\%, while also exhibiting robust generalization across various out-of-distribution datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03297v2,2024-08
LLM Stability: A detailed analysis with some surprises,"Berk Atil, Alexa Chittams, Liseng Fu, Ferhan Ture, Lixinyu Xu, Breck Baldwin","LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs, but we have been unable to find work that evaluates LLM stability as the main objective. In our study of 6 deterministically configured LLMs across 8 common tasks with 5 identical runs, we see accuracy variations up to 10\%. In addition, no LLM consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks. We also show examples of variation that are not normally distributed and compare configurations with zero-shot/few-shot prompting and fine-tuned examples. To better quantify what is going on, we introduce metrics focused on stability: TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement over parsed-out answers. We suggest that stability metrics be integrated into leader boards and research results going forward.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04667v2,2024-08
SARA: Singular-Value Based Adaptive Low-Rank Adaption,"Jihao Gu, Shuai Chen, Zelin Wang, Yibo Zhang, Ping Gong","With the increasing number of parameters in large pre-trained models, LoRA as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning(PEFT) method is widely used for not adding inference overhead. The LoRA method assumes that weight changes during fine-tuning can be approximated by low-rank matrices. However, the rank values need to be manually verified to match different downstream tasks, and they cannot accommodate the varying importance of different layers in the model. In this work, we first analyze the relationship between the performance of different layers and their ranks using SVD. Based on this, we design the Singular-Value Based Adaptive Low-Rank Adaption(SARA), which adaptively finds the rank during initialization by performing SVD on the pre-trained weights. Additionally, we explore the Mixture-of-SARA(Mo-SARA), which significantly reduces the number of parameters by fine-tuning only multiple parallel sets of singular values controlled by a router. Extensive experiments on various complex tasks demonstrate the simplicity and parameter efficiency of our methods. They can effectively and adaptively find the most suitable rank for each layer of each model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03290v1,2024-08

Downes, Patrick Forber, Alex Grzankowski","LLMs are statistical models of language learning through stochastic gradient descent with a next token prediction objective. Prompting a popular view among AI modelers: LLMs are just next token predictors. While LLMs are engineered using next token prediction, and trained based on their success at this task, our view is that a reduction to just next token predictor sells LLMs short. Moreover, there are important explanations of LLM behavior and capabilities that are lost when we engage in this kind of reduction. In order to draw this out, we will make an analogy with a once prominent research program in biology explaining evolution and development from the gene's eye view.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04666v1,2024-08
StructEval: Deepen and Broaden Large Language Model Assessment via Structured Evaluation,"Boxi Cao, Mengjie Ren, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Feng Zhang, Junfeng Zhan, Le Sun","Evaluation is the baton for the development of large language models. Current evaluations typically employ a single-item assessment paradigm for each atomic test objective, which struggles to discern whether a model genuinely possesses the required capabilities or merely memorizes/guesses the answers to specific questions. To this end, we propose a novel evaluation framework referred to as StructEval. Starting from an atomic test objective, StructEval deepens and broadens the evaluation by conducting a structured assessment across multiple cognitive levels and critical concepts, and therefore offers a comprehensive, robust and consistent evaluation for LLMs. Experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that StructEval serves as a reliable tool for resisting the risk of data contamination and reducing the interference of potential biases, thereby providing more reliable and consistent conclusions regarding model capabilities. Our framework also sheds light on the design of future principled and trustworthy LLM evaluation protocols.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03281v2,2024-08
LAMPO: Large Language Models as Preference Machines for Few-shot Ordinal Classification,"Zhen Qin, Junru Wu, Jiaming Shen, Tianqi Liu, Xuanhui Wang","We introduce LAMPO, a novel paradigm that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving few-shot multi-class ordinal classification tasks. Unlike conventional methods, which concatenate all demonstration examples with the test instance and prompt LLMs to produce the pointwise prediction, our framework uses the LLM as a preference machine that makes a relative comparative decision between the test instance and each demonstration. A self-supervised method is then introduced to aggregate these binary comparisons into the final ordinal decision. LAMPO addresses several limitations inherent in previous methods, including context length constraints, ordering biases, and challenges associated with absolute point-wise estimation. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate LAMPO's remarkably competitive performance across a diverse spectrum of applications (e.g., movie review analysis and hate speech detection). Notably, in certain applications, the improvement can be substantial, exceeding 20% in an absolute term. Moreover, we believe LAMPO represents an interesting addition to the non-parametric application layered on top of LLMs, as it supports black-box LLMs without necessitating the outputting of LLM's internal states (e.g., embeddings), as seen in previous approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03359v1,2024-08
OpenFactCheck: A Unified Framework for Factuality Evaluation of LLMs,"Hasan Iqbal, Yuxia Wang, Minghan Wang, Georgi Georgiev, Jiahui Geng, Iryna Gurevych, Preslav Nakov","The increased use of large language models (LLMs) across a variety of real-world applications calls for automatic tools to check the factual accuracy of their outputs, as LLMs often hallucinate. This is difficult as it requires assessing the factuality of free-form open-domain responses. While there has been a lot of research on this topic, different papers use different evaluation benchmarks and measures, which makes them hard to compare and hampers future progress. To mitigate these issues, we developed OpenFactCheck, a unified framework, with three modules: (i) RESPONSEEVAL, which allows users to easily customize an automatic fact-checking system and to assess the factuality of all claims in an input document using that system, (ii) LLMEVAL, which assesses the overall factuality of an LLM, and (iii) CHECKEREVAL, a module to evaluate automatic fact-checking systems.

The method not only enhances the domain generalization of text-to-SQL models but also explores the potential of error data supervision through preference learning. Furthermore, we employ the synthetic data approach for instruction tuning on open-source LLMs, resulting SENSE, a specialized text-to-SQL model. The effectiveness of SENSE is demonstrated through state-of-the-art results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks, bridging the performance gap between open-source models and methods prompted by closed-source models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03256v1,2024-08
Unveiling Factual Recall Behaviors of Large Language Models through Knowledge Neurons,"Yifei Wang, Yuheng Chen, Wanting Wen, Yu Sheng, Linjing Li, Daniel Dajun Zeng","In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) actively recall or retrieve their internal repositories of factual knowledge when faced with reasoning tasks. Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances. Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions. By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation. Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks. Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning. Furthermore, we explored how contextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs. Code and data will be available soon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03247v3,2024-08

LLM-based MOFs Synthesis Condition Extraction using Few-Shot Demonstrations,"Lei Shi, Zhimeng Liu, Yi Yang, Weize Wu, Yuyang Zhang, Hongbo Zhang, Jing Lin, Siyu Wu, Zihan Chen, Ruiming Li, Nan Wang, Zipeng Liu, Huobin Tan, Hongyi Gao, Yue Zhang, Ge Wang","The extraction of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) synthesis conditions from literature text has been challenging but crucial for the logical design of new MOFs with desirable functionality. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) provides disruptively new solution to this long-standing problem and latest researches have reported over 90% F1 in extracting correct conditions from MOFs literature. We argue in this paper that most existing synthesis extraction practices with LLMs stay with the primitive zero-shot learning, which could lead to downgraded extraction and application performance due to the lack of specialized knowledge. This work pioneers and optimizes the few-shot in-context learning paradigm for LLM extraction of material synthesis conditions. First, we propose a human-AI joint data curation process to secure high-quality ground-truth demonstrations for few-shot learning. Second, we apply a BM25 algorithm based on the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique to adaptively select few-shot demonstrations for each MOF's extraction. Over a dataset randomly sampled from 84,898 well-defined MOFs, the proposed few-shot method achieves much higher average F1 performance (0.93 vs. 0.81, +14.8%) than the native zero-shot LLM using the same GPT-4 model, under fully automatic evaluation that are more objective than the previous human evaluation. The proposed method is further validated through real-world material experiments: compared with the baseline zero-shot LLM, the proposed few-shot approach increases the MOFs structural inference performance (R^2) by 29.4% in average.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04665v1,2024-08
A Debiased Nearest Neighbors Framework for Multi-Label Text Classification,"Zifeng Cheng, Zhiwei Jiang, Yafeng Yin, Zhaoling Chen, Cong Wang, Shiping Ge, Qiguo Huang, Qing Gu","Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC) is a practical yet challenging task that involves assigning multiple non-exclusive labels to each document. Previous studies primarily focus on capturing label correlations to assist label prediction by introducing special labeling schemes, designing specific model structures, or adding auxiliary tasks. Recently, the $k$ Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) framework has shown promise by retrieving labeled samples as references to mine label co-occurrence information in the embedding space. However, two critical biases, namely embedding alignment bias and confidence estimation bias, are often overlooked, adversely affecting prediction performance. In this paper, we introduce a DEbiased Nearest Neighbors (DENN) framework for MLTC, specifically designed to mitigate these biases. To address embedding alignment bias, we propose a debiased contrastive learning strategy, enhancing neighbor consistency on label co-occurrence. For confidence estimation bias, we present a debiased confidence estimation strategy, improving the adaptive combination of predictions from $k$NN and inductive binary classifications.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), serving as the foundational framework for numerous NLP architectures and language models, is increasingly employed for the development of low-resource NLP models. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is a method for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) and reducing the training parameters to some extent to decrease the computational costs needed for training the model and achieve results comparable to a fully fine-tuned model. In this work, we present a study of PEFT methods for the Indic low-resource language Marathi. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of PEFT methods applied to various monolingual and multilingual Marathi BERT models. These approaches are evaluated on prominent text classification datasets like MahaSent, MahaHate, and MahaNews. The incorporation of PEFT techniques is demonstrated to significantly expedite the training speed of the models, addressing a critical aspect of model development and deployment. In this study, we explore Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models (LoRA) and adapter methods for low-resource text classification.

Leveraging Entity Information for Cross-Modality Correlation Learning: The Entity-Guided Multimodal Summarization,"Yanghai Zhang, Ye Liu, Shiwei Wu, Kai Zhang, Xukai Liu, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen","The rapid increase in multimedia data has spurred advancements in Multimodal Summarization with Multimodal Output (MSMO), which aims to produce a multimodal summary that integrates both text and relevant images. The inherent heterogeneity of content within multimodal inputs and outputs presents a significant challenge to the execution of MSMO. Traditional approaches typically adopt a holistic perspective on coarse image-text data or individual visual objects, overlooking the essential connections between objects and the entities they represent. To integrate the fine-grained entity knowledge, we propose an Entity-Guided Multimodal Summarization model (EGMS). Our model, building on BART, utilizes dual multimodal encoders with shared weights to process text-image and entity-image information concurrently. A gating mechanism then combines visual data for enhanced textual summary generation, while image selection is refined through knowledge distillation from a pre-trained vision-language model.

Lisbon Computational Linguists at SemEval-2024 Task 2: Using A Mistral 7B Model and Data Augmentation,"Artur Guimarães, Bruno Martins, João Magalhães","This paper describes our approach to the SemEval-2024 safe biomedical Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials (NLI4CT) task, which concerns classifying statements about Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs).

Evaluating the Translation Performance of Large Language Models Based on Euas-20,"Yan Huang, Wei Liu","In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning technology, large language models (LLMs) such as BERT and GPT have achieved breakthrough results in natural language processing tasks. Machine translation (MT), as one of the core tasks of natural language processing, has also benefited from the development of large language models and achieved a qualitative leap. Despite the significant progress in translation performance achieved by large language models, machine translation still faces many challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we construct the dataset Euas-20 to evaluate the performance of large language models on translation tasks, the translation ability on different languages, and the effect of pre-training data on the translation ability of LLMs for researchers and developers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03119v1,2024-08
Topic Modeling with Fine-tuning LLMs and Bag of Sentences,Johannes Schneider,"Large language models (LLM)'s are increasingly used for topic modeling outperforming classical topic models such as LDA. Commonly, pre-trained LLM encoders such as BERT are used out-of-the-box despite the fact that fine-tuning is known to improve LLMs considerably. The challenge lies in obtaining a suitable (labeled) dataset for fine-tuning. In this paper, we use the recent idea to use bag of sentences as the elementary unit in computing topics. In turn, we derive an approach FT-Topic to perform unsupervised fine-tuning relying primarily on two steps for constructing a training dataset in an automatic fashion. First, a heuristic method to identifies pairs of sentence groups that are either assumed to be of the same or different topics. Second, we remove sentence pairs that are likely labeled incorrectly. The dataset is then used to fine-tune an encoder LLM, which can be leveraged by any topic modeling approach using embeddings. However, in this work, we demonstrate its effectiveness by deriving a novel state-of-the-art topic modeling method called SenClu, which achieves fast inference through an expectation-maximization algorithm and hard assignments of sentence groups to a single topic, while giving users the possibility to encode prior knowledge on the topic-document distribution.

500xCompressor: Generalized Prompt Compression for Large Language Models,"Zongqian Li, Yixuan Su, Nigel Collier","Prompt compression is crucial for enhancing inference speed, reducing costs, and improving user experience. However, current methods face challenges such as low compression ratios and potential data leakage during evaluation. To address these issues, we propose 500xCompressor, a method that compresses extensive natural language contexts into a minimum of one single special token. The 500xCompressor introduces approximately 0.3% additional parameters and achieves compression ratios ranging from 6x to 480x. It is designed to compress any text, answer various types of questions, and could be utilized by the original large language model (LLM) without requiring fine-tuning. Initially, 500xCompressor was pretrained on the Arxiv Corpus, followed by fine-tuning on the ArxivQA dataset, and subsequently evaluated on strictly unseen and classical question answering (QA) datasets. The results demonstrate that the LLM retained 62.26-72.89% of its capabilities compared to using non-compressed prompts. This study also shows that not all the compressed tokens are equally utilized and that K V values have significant advantages over embeddings in preserving information at high compression ratios. The highly compressive nature of natural language prompts, even for fine-grained complex information, suggests promising potential for future applications and further research into developing a new LLM language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03094v1,2024-08
Extend Model Merging from Fine-Tuned to Pre-Trained Large Language Models via Weight Disentanglement,"Le Yu, Bowen Yu, Haiyang Yu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li","Merging Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to amalgamate multiple homologous LLMs into one with all the capabilities. Ideally, any LLMs sharing the same backbone should be mergeable, irrespective of whether they are Fine-Tuned (FT) with minor parameter changes or Pre-Trained (PT) with substantial parameter shifts. However, existing methods often manually assign the model importance, rendering them feasible only for LLMs with similar parameter alterations, such as multiple FT LLMs. The diverse parameter changed ranges between FT and PT LLMs pose challenges for current solutions in empirically determining the optimal combination. In this paper, we make a pioneering effort to broaden the applicability of merging techniques from FT to PT LLMs. We initially examine the efficacy of current methods in merging FT and PT LLMs, discovering that they struggle to deal with PT LLMs. Subsequently, we introduce an approach based on WeIght DisENtanglement (WIDEN) to effectively extend the merging scope, which first disentangles model weights into magnitude and direction components, and then performs adaptive fusion by considering their respective contributions. In the experiments, we merge Qwen1.5-Chat (an FT LLM with instruction-following skills) with Sailor (a PT LLM with multilingual abilities) across 7B and 14B model scales. Results reveal that: (1) existing solutions usually fail when merging Sailor, either losing both abilities or only retaining instruction-following skills; (2) WIDEN successfully injects the multilingual abilities of Sailor into Qwen1.5-Chat and make it proficient in Southeast Asian languages, achieving enhancements in the fundamental capabilities. In light of previous research, we also merge multiple 13B FT LLMs and observe that WIDEN achieves a balanced amalgamation of instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation skills.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03092v1,2024-08
Enhancing Complex Causality Extraction via Improved Subtask Interaction and Knowledge Fusion,"Jinglong Gao, Chen Lu, Xiao Ding, Zhongyang Li, Ting Liu, Bing Qin","Event Causality Extraction (ECE) aims at extracting causal event pairs from texts. Despite ChatGPT's recent success, fine-tuning small models remains the best approach for the ECE task. However, existing fine-tuning based ECE methods cannot address all three key challenges in ECE simultaneously: 1) Complex Causality Extraction, where multiple causal-effect pairs occur within a single sentence; 2) Subtask~ Interaction, which involves modeling the mutual dependence between the two subtasks of ECE, i.e., extracting events and identifying the causal relationship between extracted events; and 3) Knowledge Fusion, which requires effectively fusing the knowledge in two modalities, i.e., the expressive pretrained language models and the structured knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a unified ECE framework (UniCE to address all three issues in ECE simultaneously. Specifically, we design a subtask interaction mechanism to enable mutual interaction between the two ECE subtasks. Besides, we design a knowledge fusion mechanism to fuse knowledge in the two modalities. Furthermore, we employ separate decoders for each subtask to facilitate complex causality extraction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms ChatGPT with a margin of at least 30% F1-score. More importantly, our model can also be used to effectively improve the ECE performance of ChatGPT via in-context learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03079v1,2024-08
Towards an Analysis of Discourse and Interactional Pragmatic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models,"Amelie Robrecht, Judith Sieker, Clara Lachenmaier, Sina Zarieß, Stefan Kopp","In this work, we want to give an overview on which pragmatic abilities have been tested in LLMs so far and how these tests have been carried out. To do this, we first discuss the scope of the field of pragmatics and suggest a subdivision into discourse pragmatics and interactional pragmatics. We give a non-exhaustive overview of the phenomena of those two subdomains and the methods traditionally used to analyze them. We subsequently consider the resulting heterogeneous set of phenomena and methods as a starting point for our survey of work on discourse pragmatics and interactional pragmatics in the context of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03074v1,2024-08
Probing structural constraints of negation in Pretrained Language Models,"David Kletz, Marie Candito, Pascal Amsili","Contradictory results about the encoding of the semantic impact of negation in pretrained language models (PLMs). have been drawn recently (e.g. Kassner and Sch{\""u}tze (2020); Gubelmann and Handschuh (2022)). In this paper we focus rather on the way PLMs encode negation and its formal impact, through the phenomenon of the Negative Polarity Item (NPI) licensing in English. More precisely, we use probes to identify which contextual representations best encode 1) the presence of negation in a sentence, and 2) the polarity of a neighboring masked polarity item. We find that contextual representations of tokens inside the negation scope do allow for (i) a better prediction of the presence of not compared to those outside the scope and (ii) a better prediction of the right polarity of a masked polarity item licensed by not, although the magnitude of the difference varies from PLM to PLM. Importantly, in both cases the trend holds even when controlling for distance to not. This tends to indicate that the embeddings of these models do reflect the notion of negation scope, and do encode the impact of negation on NPI licensing. Yet, further control experiments reveal that the presence of other lexical items is also better captured when using the contextual representation of a token within the same syntactic clause than outside from it, suggesting that PLMs simply capture the more general notion of syntactic clause.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03070v1,2024-08
Analysis of Argument Structure Constructions in a Deep Recurrent Language Model,"Pegah Ramezani, Achim Schilling, Patrick Krauss","Understanding how language and linguistic constructions are processed in the brain is a fundamental question in cognitive computational neuroscience. In this study, we explore the representation and processing of Argument Structure Constructions (ASCs) in a recurrent neural language model. We trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on a custom-made dataset consisting of 2000 sentences, generated using GPT-4, representing four distinct ASCs: transitive, ditransitive, caused-motion, and resultative constructions.   We analyzed the internal activations of the LSTM model's hidden layers using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to visualize the sentence representations. The Generalized Discrimination Value (GDV) was calculated to quantify the degree of clustering within these representations. Our results show that sentence representations form distinct clusters corresponding to the four ASCs across all hidden layers, with the most pronounced clustering observed in the last hidden layer before the output layer. This indicates that even a relatively simple, brain-constrained recurrent neural network can effectively differentiate between various construction types.   These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the emergence of word class and syntax rule representations in recurrent language models trained on next word prediction tasks. In future work, we aim to validate these results using larger language models and compare them with neuroimaging data obtained during continuous speech perception. This study highlights the potential of recurrent neural language models to mirror linguistic processing in the human brain, providing valuable insights into the computational and neural mechanisms underlying language understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03062v1,2024-08
The Use of Large Language Models (LLM) for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) in Cybercrime Forums,"Vanessa Clairoux-Trepanier, Isa-May Beauchamp, Estelle Ruellan, Masarah Paquet-Clouston, Serge-Olivier Paquette, Eric Clay","Large language models (LLMs) can be used to analyze cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data from cybercrime forums, which contain extensive information and key discussions about emerging cyber threats. However, to date, the level of accuracy and efficiency of LLMs for such critical tasks has yet to be thoroughly evaluated. Hence, this study assesses the performance of an LLM system built on the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model [8] to extract CTI information. To do so, a random sample of more than 700 daily conversations from three cybercrime forums - XSS, Exploit_in, and RAMP - was extracted, and the LLM system was instructed to summarize the conversations and predict 10 key CTI variables, such as whether a large organization and/or a critical infrastructure is being targeted, with only simple human-language instructions. Then, two coders reviewed each conversation and evaluated whether the information extracted by the LLM was accurate. The LLM system performed well, with an average accuracy score of 96.23%, an average precision of 90% and an average recall of 88.2%. Various ways to enhance the model were uncovered, such as the need to help the LLM distinguish between stories and past events, as well as being careful with verb tenses in prompts. Nevertheless, the results of this study highlight the relevance of using LLMs for cyber threat intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03354v3,2024-08

To address these challenges, we fine-tuned several large language models (LLMs) to optimize performance for each task. Specifically, we used 4-bit quantization and LoRA to determine which layers of the LLMs should be trained at a lower precision. This approach not only accelerated the fine-tuning process on the training data provided by the organizers but also enabled us to run the models on low GPU memory.

Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) via Language-Contrastive Decoding (LCD),"Avshalom Manevich, Reut Tsarfaty","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs) that facilitate processing both image and text inputs, expanding AI capabilities. However, LVLMs struggle with object hallucinations due to their reliance on text cues and learned object co-occurrence biases. While most research quantifies these hallucinations, mitigation strategies are still lacking. Our study introduces a Language Contrastive Decoding (LCD) algorithm that adjusts LVLM outputs based on LLM distribution confidence levels, effectively reducing object hallucinations. We demonstrate the advantages of LCD in leading LVLMs, showing up to %4 improvement in POPE F1 scores and up to %36 reduction in CHAIR scores on the COCO validation set, while also improving captioning quality scores. Our method effectively improves LVLMs without needing complex post-processing or retraining, and is easily applicable to different models.

However, their effectiveness is hindered by limited domain-specific knowledge, raising concerns about the reliability of their responses. We introduce a hybrid system that augments LLMs with domain-specific knowledge graphs (KGs), thereby aiming to enhance factual correctness using a KG-based retrieval approach.

Empathy Level Alignment via Reinforcement Learning for Empathetic Response Generation,"Hui Ma, Bo Zhang, Bo Xu, Jian Wang, Hongfei Lin, Xiao Sun","Empathetic response generation, aiming to understand the user's situation and feelings and respond empathically, is crucial in building human-like dialogue systems. Traditional approaches typically employ maximum likelihood estimation as the optimization objective during training, yet fail to align the empathy levels between generated and target responses. To this end, we propose an empathetic response generation framework using reinforcement learning (EmpRL). The framework develops an effective empathy reward function and generates empathetic responses by maximizing the expected reward through reinforcement learning. EmpRL utilizes the pre-trained T5 model as the generator and further fine-tunes it to initialize the policy. To align the empathy levels between generated and target responses within a given context, an empathy reward function containing three empathy communication mechanisms -- emotional reaction, interpretation, and exploration -- is constructed using pre-designed and pre-trained empathy identifiers. During reinforcement learning training, the proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to fine-tune the policy, enabling the generation of empathetic responses. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed EmpRL framework significantly improves the quality of generated responses, enhances the similarity in empathy levels between generated and target responses, and produces empathetic responses covering both affective and cognitive aspects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02976v2,2024-08
EC-Guide: A Comprehensive E-Commerce Guide for Instruction Tuning and Quantization,"Zhaopeng Feng, Zijie Meng, Zuozhu Liu","Large language models (LLMs) have attracted considerable attention in various fields for their cost-effective solutions to diverse challenges, especially with advancements in instruction tuning and quantization.

Accuracy and Consistency of LLMs in the Registered Dietitian Exam: The Impact of Prompt Engineering and Knowledge Retrieval,"Iman Azimi, Mohan Qi, Li Wang, Amir M. Rahmani, Youlin Li","Large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally transforming human-facing applications in the health and well-being domains: boosting patient engagement, accelerating clinical decision-making, and facilitating medical education. Although state-of-the-art LLMs have shown superior performance in several conversational applications, evaluations within nutrition and diet applications are still insufficient. In this paper, we propose to employ the Registered Dietitian (RD) exam to conduct a standard and comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, assessing both accuracy and consistency in nutrition queries. Our evaluation includes 1050 RD exam questions encompassing several nutrition topics and proficiency levels. In addition, for the first time, we examine the impact of Zero-Shot (ZS), Chain of Thought (CoT), Chain of Thought with Self Consistency (CoT-SC), and Retrieval Augmented Prompting (RAP) on both accuracy and consistency of the responses. Our findings revealed that while these LLMs obtained acceptable overall performance, their results varied considerably with different prompts and question domains. GPT-4o with CoT-SC prompting outperformed the other approaches, whereas Gemini 1.5 Pro with ZS recorded the highest consistency. For GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, CoT improved the accuracy, and CoT-SC improved both accuracy and consistency. RAP was particularly effective for GPT-4o to answer Expert level questions. Consequently, choosing the appropriate LLM and prompting technique, tailored to the proficiency level and specific domain, can mitigate errors and potential risks in diet and nutrition chatbots.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02964v2,2024-08
Are Female Carpenters like Blue Bananas? A Corpus Investigation of Occupation Gender Typicality,"Da Ju, Karen Ulrich, Adina Williams","People tend to use language to mention surprising properties of events: for example, when a banana is blue, we are more likely to mention color than when it is yellow. This fact is taken to suggest that yellowness is somehow a typical feature of bananas, and blueness is exceptional. Similar to how a yellow color is typical of bananas, there may also be genders that are typical of occupations. In this work, we explore this question using information theoretic techniques coupled with corpus statistic analysis. In two distinct large corpora, we do not find strong evidence that occupations and gender display the same patterns of mentioning as do bananas and color. Instead, we find that gender mentioning is correlated with femaleness of occupation in particular, suggesting perhaps that woman-dominated occupations are seen as somehow ``more gendered'' than male-dominated ones, and thereby they encourage more gender mentioning overall.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02948v1,2024-08

In fine-tuning, we trained the multi-channel conformer-transducer. All experiments were conducted using the far-field in-house and CHiME-4 datasets.

HARMONIC: Harnessing LLMs for Tabular Data Synthesis and Privacy Protection,"Yuxin Wang, Duanyu Feng, Yongfu Dai, Zhengyu Chen, Jimin Huang, Sophia Ananiadou, Qianqian Xie, Hao Wang","Data serves as the fundamental foundation for advancing deep learning, particularly tabular data presented in a structured format, which is highly conducive to modeling. However, even in the era of LLM, obtaining tabular data from sensitive domains remains a challenge due to privacy or copyright concerns. Hence, exploring how to effectively use models like LLMs to generate realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data is urgent. In this paper, we take a step forward to explore LLMs for tabular data synthesis and privacy protection, by introducing a new framework HARMONIC for tabular data generation and evaluation. In the tabular data generation of our framework, unlike previous small-scale LLM-based methods that rely on continued pre-training, we explore the larger-scale LLMs with fine-tuning to generate tabular data and enhance privacy. Based on idea of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, an instruction fine-tuning dataset is constructed to inspire LLMs to discover inter-row relationships. Then, with fine-tuning, LLMs are trained to remember the format and connections of the data rather than the data itself, which reduces the risk of privacy leakage. In the evaluation part of our framework, we develop specific privacy risk metrics DLT for LLM synthetic data generation, as well as performance evaluation metrics LLE for downstream LLM tasks. Our experiments find that this tabular data generation framework achieves equivalent performance to existing methods with better privacy, which also demonstrates our evaluation framework for the effectiveness of synthetic data and privacy risks in LLM scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02927v1,2024-08
Intermediate direct preference optimization,Atsushi Kojima,"We propose the intermediate direct preference optimization (DPO) method to calculate the DPO loss at selected intermediate layers as an auxiliary loss for finetuning large language models (LLMs). The conventional DPO method fine-tunes a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model by calculating the DPO loss using logits from the final layer. In our intermediate DPO approach, DPO losses are calculated using the logits from K-selected intermediate layers and averaged to obtain the intermediate DPO loss. For training the intermediate DPO model, the final loss is obtained by calculating the weighted sum of the DPO and intermediate DPO losses. During inference, the intermediate DPO model decodes using the final layer logits similarly to the conventional DPO model. In experiments using the ultrafeedback dataset, the performance of the intermediate DPO model was evaluated using GPT-4. As a result, the intermediate DPO model trained using the intermediate DPO loss calculated at the 22nd layer of a 32-layer SFT model achieved win rates of 52.5% and 67.5% against the conventional DPO and SFT models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we report the relationships among the position of the selected intermediate layers, the number of layers, and performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02923v1,2024-08
Data Checklist: On Unit-Testing Datasets with Usable Information,"Heidi C. Zhang, Shabnam Behzad, Kawin Ethayarajh, Dan Jurafsky","Model checklists (Ribeiro et al., 2020) have emerged as a useful tool for understanding the behavior of LLMs, analogous to unit-testing in software engineering. However, despite datasets being a key determinant of model behavior, evaluating datasets, e.g., for the existence of annotation artifacts, is largely done ad hoc, once a problem in model behavior has already been found downstream. In this work, we take a more principled approach to unit-testing datasets by proposing a taxonomy based on the V-information literature. We call a collection of such unit tests a data checklist. Using a checklist, not only are we able to recover known artifacts in well-known datasets such as SNLI, but we also discover previously unknown artifacts in preference datasets for LLM alignment. Data checklists further enable a new kind of data filtering, which we use to improve the efficacy and data efficiency of preference alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02919v1,2024-08
Leveraging Inter-Chunk Interactions for Enhanced Retrieval in Large Language Model-Based Question Answering,"Tiezheng Guo, Chen Wang, Yanyi Liu, Jiawei Tang, Pan Li, Sai Xu, Qingwen Yang, Xianlin Gao, Zhi Li, Yingyou Wen","Retrieving external knowledge and prompting large language models with relevant information is an effective paradigm to enhance the performance of question-answering tasks. Previous research typically handles paragraphs from external documents in isolation, resulting in a lack of context and ambiguous references, particularly in multi-document and complex tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new retrieval framework IIER, that leverages Inter-chunk Interactions to Enhance Retrieval. This framework captures the internal connections between document chunks by considering three types of interactions: structural, keyword, and semantic. We then construct a unified Chunk-Interaction Graph to represent all external documents comprehensively. Additionally, we design a graph-based evidence chain retriever that utilizes previous paths and chunk interactions to guide the retrieval process. It identifies multiple seed nodes based on the target question and iteratively searches for relevant chunks to gather supporting evidence. This retrieval process refines the context and reasoning chain, aiding the large language model in reasoning and answer generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IIER outperforms strong baselines across four datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in improving retrieval and reasoning capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02907v1,2024-08

The first is a lack of comprehensive and reproducible experiments across various methods, datasets, and video-text features. This is because no unified training and evaluation codebase covers multiple settings. The second is user-unfriendly design. Because previous works use different libraries, researchers set up individual environments. In addition, most works release only the training codes, requiring users to implement the whole inference process of MR-HD. Lighthouse addresses these issues by implementing a unified reproducible codebase that includes six models, three features, and five datasets. In addition, it provides an inference API and web demo to make these methods easily accessible for researchers and developers. Our experiments demonstrate that Lighthouse generally reproduces the reported scores in the reference papers. The code is available at https://github.com/line/lighthouse.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02901v3,2024-08
Citekit: A Modular Toolkit for Large Language Model Citation Generation,"Jiajun Shen, Tong Zhou, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu","Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate citations in Question-Answering (QA) tasks is an emerging paradigm aimed at enhancing the verifiability of their responses when LLMs are utilizing external references to generate an answer. However, there is currently no unified framework to standardize and fairly compare different citation generation methods, leading to difficulties in reproducing different methods and a comprehensive assessment. To cope with the problems above, we introduce \name, an open-source and modular toolkit designed to facilitate the implementation and evaluation of existing citation generation methods, while also fostering the development of new approaches to improve citation quality in LLM outputs. This tool is highly extensible, allowing users to utilize 4 main modules and 14 components to construct a pipeline, evaluating an existing method or innovative designs. Our experiments with two state-of-the-art LLMs and 11 citation generation baselines demonstrate varying strengths of different modules in answer accuracy and citation quality improvement, as well as the challenge of enhancing granularity. Based on our analysis of the effectiveness of components, we propose a new method, self-RAG \snippet, obtaining a balanced answer accuracy and citation quality. Citekit is released at https://github.com/SjJ1017/Citekit.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04662v2,2024-08
SETN: Stock Embedding Enhanced with Textual and Network Information,"Takehiro Takayanagi, Hiroki Sakaji, Kiyoshi Izumi","Stock embedding is a method for vector representation of stocks. There is a growing demand for vector representations of stock, i.e., stock embedding, in wealth management sectors, and the method has been applied to various tasks such as stock price prediction, portfolio optimization, and similar fund identifications. Stock embeddings have the advantage of enabling the quantification of relative relationships between stocks, and they can extract useful information from unstructured data such as text and network data. In this study, we propose stock embedding enhanced with textual and network information (SETN) using a domain-adaptive pre-trained transformer-based model to embed textual information and a graph neural network model to grasp network information. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on related company information extraction tasks. We also demonstrate that stock embeddings obtained from the proposed model perform better in creating thematic funds than those obtained from baseline methods, providing a promising pathway for various applications in the wealth management industry.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02899v1,2024-08
VisionUnite: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Ophthalmology Enhanced with Clinical Knowledge,"Zihan Li, Diping Song, Zefeng Yang, Deming Wang, Fei Li, Xiulan Zhang, Paul E. Kinahan, Yu Qiao","The need for improved diagnostic methods in ophthalmology is acute, especially in the less developed regions with limited access to specialists and advanced equipment. Therefore, we introduce VisionUnite, a novel vision-language foundation model for ophthalmology enhanced with clinical knowledge. VisionUnite has been pretrained on an extensive dataset comprising 1.24 million image-text pairs, and further refined using our proposed MMFundus dataset, which includes 296,379 high-quality fundus image-text pairs and 889,137 simulated doctor-patient dialogue instances. Our experiments indicate that VisionUnite outperforms existing generative foundation models such as GPT-4V and Gemini Pro. It also demonstrates diagnostic capabilities comparable to junior ophthalmologists. VisionUnite performs well in various clinical scenarios including open-ended multi-disease diagnosis, clinical explanation, and patient interaction, making it a highly versatile tool for initial ophthalmic disease screening.

A Framework for Fine-Tuning LLMs using Heterogeneous Feedback,"Ryan Aponte, Ryan A. Rossi, Shunan Guo, Franck Dernoncourt, Tong Yu, Xiang Chen, Subrata Mitra, Nedim Lipka","Large language models (LLMs) have been applied to a wide range of tasks, including text summarization, web navigation, and chatbots. They have benefitted from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) following an unsupervised pretraining. These datasets can be difficult to collect, limited in scope, and vary in sample quality. Additionally, datasets can vary extensively in supervision format, from numerical to binary as well as multi-dimensional with many different values. We present a framework for fine-tuning LLMs using heterogeneous feedback, which has two main components. First, we combine the heterogeneous feedback data into a single supervision format, compatible with methods like SFT and RLHF. Next, given this unified feedback dataset, we extract a high-quality and diverse subset to obtain performance increases potentially exceeding the full dataset. We conduct extensive experiments to understand the effectiveness of these techniques for incorporating heterogeneous feedback, and demonstrate improvements from using a high-quality and diverse subset of the data. We find that our framework is able to improve models in multiple areas simultaneously, such as in instruction following and bias reduction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02861v1,2024-08
MaterioMiner -- An ontology-based text mining dataset for extraction of process-structure-property entities,"Ali Riza Durmaz, Akhil Thomas, Lokesh Mishra, Rachana Niranjan Murthy, Thomas Straub","While large language models learn sound statistical representations of the language and information therein, ontologies are symbolic knowledge representations that can complement the former ideally. Research at this critical intersection relies on datasets that intertwine ontologies and text corpora to enable training and comprehensive benchmarking of neurosymbolic models. We present the MaterioMiner dataset and the linked materials mechanics ontology where ontological concepts from the mechanics of materials domain are associated with textual entities within the literature corpus. Another distinctive feature of the dataset is its eminently fine-granular annotation. Specifically, 179 distinct classes are manually annotated by three raters within four publications, amounting to a total of 2191 entities that were annotated and curated. Conceptual work is presented for the symbolic representation of causal composition-process-microstructure-property relationships. We explore the annotation consistency between the three raters and perform fine-tuning of pre-trained models to showcase the feasibility of named-entity recognition model training. Reusing the dataset can foster training and benchmarking of materials language models, automated ontology construction, and knowledge graph generation from textual data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04661v1,2024-08
Interpretation of the Intent Detection Problem as Dynamics in a Low-dimensional Space,"Eduardo Sanchez-Karhunen, Jose F. Quesada-Moreno, Miguel A. Gutiérrez-Naranjo","Intent detection is a text classification task whose aim is to recognize and label the semantics behind a users query. It plays a critical role in various business applications. The output of the intent detection module strongly conditions the behavior of the whole system. This sequence analysis task is mainly tackled using deep learning techniques. Despite the widespread use of these techniques, the internal mechanisms used by networks to solve the problem are poorly understood. Recent lines of work have analyzed the computational mechanisms learned by RNNs from a dynamical systems perspective. In this work, we investigate how different RNN architectures solve the SNIPS intent detection problem. Sentences injected into trained networks can be interpreted as trajectories traversing a hidden state space. This space is constrained to a low-dimensional manifold whose dimensionality is related to the embedding and hidden layer sizes. To generate predictions, RNN steers the trajectories towards concrete regions, spatially aligned with the output layer matrix rows directions. Underlying the system dynamics, an unexpected fixed point topology has been identified with a limited number of attractors. Our results provide new insights into the inner workings of networks that solve the intent detection task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02838v1,2024-08
"Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models","Nunzio Lore, Sepehr Ilami, Babak Heydari","As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state-of-the-art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized algorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social contexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use them for Q&A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is therefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations provided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to navigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model consistently bridged the gap in performance between the smaller pre-trained version of the model and its larger relative and that its improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples, including on out-of-sample scenarios that include completely different game structures. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a 46% improvement measured as alignment towards the behavior of the larger model, with 100% representing indistinguishable behavior. When presented with out-of-sample social contexts and games, the fine-tuned model still displays remarkable levels of alignment, reaching an improvement of 18% and 28% respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05241v4,2024-08
miniCTX: Neural Theorem Proving with (Long-)Contexts,"Jiewen Hu, Thomas Zhu, Sean Welleck","Real-world formal theorem proving often depends on a wealth of context, including definitions, lemmas, comments, file structure, and other information. We introduce miniCTX, which tests a model's ability to prove formal mathematical theorems that depend on new context that is not seen during training. miniCTX contains theorems sourced from real Lean projects and textbooks, each associated with a context that can span tens of thousands of tokens. Models are tasked with proving a theorem given access to code from the theorem's repository, which contains context that is needed for the proof. As a baseline for miniCTX, we tested fine-tuning and prompting methods that condition theorem proving on preceding context. Both approaches substantially outperform traditional methods that rely solely on state information. We found that this ability to use context is not captured by previous benchmarks such as miniF2F. Alongside miniCTX, we offer ntp-toolkit for automatically extracting and annotating theorem proving data, making it easy to add new projects into miniCTX to ensure that contexts are not seen during training. miniCTX offers a challenging and realistic evaluation of neural theorem provers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03350v2,2024-08
XMainframe: A Large Language Model for Mainframe Modernization,"Anh T. V. Dau, Hieu Trung Dao, Anh Tuan Nguyen, Hieu Trung Tran, Phong X. Nguyen, Nghi D. Q. Bui","Mainframe operating systems, despite their inception in the 1940s, continue to support critical sectors like finance and government. However, these systems are often viewed as outdated, requiring extensive maintenance and modernization. Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative tools that can understand and interact with legacy codebases. To this end, we introduce XMainframe, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) specifically designed with knowledge of mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. Our solution involves the creation of an extensive data collection pipeline to produce high-quality training datasets, enhancing XMainframe's performance in this specialized domain. Additionally, we present MainframeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing mainframe knowledge, including multiple-choice questions, question answering, and COBOL code summarization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that XMainframe consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLMs across these tasks. Specifically, XMainframe achieves 30% higher accuracy than DeepSeek-Coder on multiple-choice questions, doubles the BLEU score of Mixtral-Instruct 8x7B on question answering, and scores six times higher than GPT-3.5 on COBOL summarization. Our work highlights the potential of XMainframe to drive significant advancements in managing and modernizing legacy systems, thereby enhancing productivity and saving time for software developers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04660v3,2024-08
Examining Gender and Power on Wikipedia Through Face and Politeness,"Adil Soubki, Shyne Choi, Owen Rambow","We propose a framework for analyzing discourse by combining two interdependent concepts from sociolinguistic theory: face acts and politeness. While politeness has robust existing tools and data, face acts are less resourced. We introduce a new corpus created by annotating Wikipedia talk pages with face acts and we use this to train a face act tagger. We then employ our framework to study how face and politeness interact with gender and power in discussions between Wikipedia editors. Among other findings, we observe that female Wikipedians are not only more polite, which is consistent with prior studies, but that this difference corresponds with significantly more language directed at humbling aspects of their own face. Interestingly, the distinction nearly vanishes once limiting to editors with administrative power.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02798v1,2024-08
Entity Retrieval for Answering Entity-Centric Questions,"Hassan S. Shavarani, Anoop Sarkar","The similarity between the question and indexed documents is a crucial factor in document retrieval for retrieval-augmented question answering. Although this is typically the only method for obtaining the relevant documents, it is not the sole approach when dealing with entity-centric questions. In this study, we propose Entity Retrieval, a novel retrieval method which rather than relying on question-document similarity, depends on the salient entities within the question to identify the retrieval documents. We conduct an in-depth analysis of the performance of both dense and sparse retrieval methods in comparison to Entity Retrieval. Our findings reveal that our method not only leads to more accurate answers to entity-centric questions but also operates more efficiently.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02795v1,2024-08
LLM economicus? Mapping the Behavioral Biases of LLMs via Utility Theory,"Jillian Ross, Yoon Kim, Andrew W. Lo","Humans are not homo economicus (i.e., rational economic beings). As humans, we exhibit systematic behavioral biases such as loss aversion, anchoring, framing, etc., which lead us to make suboptimal economic decisions. Insofar as such biases may be embedded in text data on which large language models (LLMs) are trained, to what extent are LLMs prone to the same behavioral biases? Understanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support human decision-making. We propose utility theory-a paradigm at the core of modern economic theory-as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs. Utility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior against benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To demonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a variety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We also find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic behavior across settings. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can measure the effect of interventions such as prompting on economic biases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02784v1,2024-08
The Mechanics of Conceptual Interpretation in GPT Models: Interpretative Insights,"Nura Aljaafari, Danilo S. Carvalho, André Freitas","Locating and editing knowledge in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their accuracy, safety, and inference rationale. We introduce ``concept editing'', an innovative variation of knowledge editing that uncovers conceptualisation mechanisms within these models. Using the reverse dictionary task, inference tracing, and input abstraction, we analyse the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Multi-Head Attention (MHA), and hidden state components of transformer models. Our results reveal distinct patterns: MLP layers employ key-value retrieval mechanism and context-dependent processing, which are highly associated with relative input tokens. MHA layers demonstrate a distributed nature with significant higher-level activations, suggesting sophisticated semantic integration. Hidden states emphasise the importance of the last token and top layers in the inference process. We observe evidence of gradual information building and distributed representation. These observations elucidate how transformer models process semantic information, paving the way for targeted interventions and improved interpretability techniques. Our work highlights the complex, layered nature of semantic processing in LLMs and the challenges of isolating and modifying specific concepts within these models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11827v1,2024-08
Self-Taught Evaluators,"Tianlu Wang, Ilia Kulikov, Olga Golovneva, Ping Yu, Weizhe Yuan, Jane Dwivedi-Yu, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Maryam Fazel-Zarandi, Jason Weston, Xian Li","Model-based evaluation is at the heart of successful model development -- as a reward model for training, and as a replacement for human evaluation. To train such evaluators, the standard approach is to collect a large amount of human preference judgments over model responses, which is costly and the data becomes stale as models improve. In this work, we present an approach that aims to im-prove evaluators without human annotations, using synthetic training data only. Starting from unlabeled instructions, our iterative self-improvement scheme generates contrasting model outputs and trains an LLM-as-a-Judge to produce reasoning traces and final judgments, repeating this training at each new iteration using the improved predictions. Without any labeled preference data, our Self-Taught Evaluator can improve a strong LLM (Llama3-70B-Instruct) from 75.4 to 88.3 (88.7 with majority vote) on RewardBench. This outperforms commonly used LLM judges such as GPT-4 and matches the performance of the top-performing reward models trained with labeled examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02666v2,2024-08
Can Reinforcement Learning Unlock the Hidden Dangers in Aligned Large Language Models?,"Mohammad Bahrami Karkevandi, Nishant Vishwamitra, Peyman Najafirad","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language tasks, but their safety and morality remain contentious due to their training on internet text corpora. To address these concerns, alignment techniques have been developed to improve the public usability and safety of LLMs. Yet, the potential for generating harmful content through these models seems to persist. This paper explores the concept of jailbreaking LLMs-reversing their alignment through adversarial triggers. Previous methods, such as soft embedding prompts, manually crafted prompts, and gradient-based automatic prompts, have had limited success on black-box models due to their requirements for model access and for producing a low variety of manually crafted prompts, making them susceptible to being blocked. This paper introduces a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize adversarial triggers, requiring only inference API access to the target model and a small surrogate model. Our method, which leverages a BERTScore-based reward function, enhances the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial triggers on new black-box models. We demonstrate that this approach improves the performance of adversarial triggers on a previously untested language model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02651v1,2024-08
Enhancing Supply Chain Visibility with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models,"Sara AlMahri, Liming Xu, Alexandra Brintrup","In today's globalized economy, comprehensive supply chain visibility is crucial for effective risk management. Achieving visibility remains a significant challenge due to limited information sharing among supply chain partners. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance supply chain visibility without relying on direct stakeholder information sharing. Our zero-shot, LLM-driven approach automates the extraction of supply chain information from diverse public sources and constructs KGs to capture complex interdependencies between supply chain entities. We employ zero-shot prompting for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) tasks, eliminating the need for extensive domain-specific training. We validate the framework with a case study on electric vehicle supply chains, focusing on tracking critical minerals for battery manufacturing. Results show significant improvements in supply chain mapping, extending visibility beyond tier-2 suppliers. The framework reveals critical dependencies and alternative sourcing options, enhancing risk management and strategic planning. With high accuracy in NER and RE tasks, it provides an effective tool for understanding complex, multi-tiered supply networks. This research offers a scalable, flexible method for constructing domain-specific supply chain KGs, addressing longstanding challenges in visibility and paving the way for advancements in digital supply chain surveillance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07705v1,2024-08
SEAS: Self-Evolving Adversarial Safety Optimization for Large Language Models,"Muxi Diao, Rumei Li, Shiyang Liu, Guogang Liao, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Weiran Xu","As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capability and influence, ensuring their security and preventing harmful outputs has become crucial. A promising approach to address these concerns involves training models to automatically generate adversarial prompts for red teaming. However, the evolving subtlety of vulnerabilities in LLMs challenges the effectiveness of current adversarial methods, which struggle to specifically target and explore the weaknesses of these models. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the $\mathbf{S}\text{elf-}\mathbf{E}\text{volving }\mathbf{A}\text{dversarial }\mathbf{S}\text{afety }\mathbf{(SEAS)}$ optimization framework, which enhances security by leveraging data generated by the model itself. SEAS operates through three iterative stages: Initialization, Attack, and Adversarial Optimization, refining both the Red Team and Target models to improve robustness and safety. This framework reduces reliance on manual testing and significantly enhances the security capabilities of LLMs. Our contributions include a novel adversarial framework, a comprehensive safety dataset, and after three iterations, the Target model achieves a security level comparable to GPT-4, while the Red Team model shows a marked increase in attack success rate (ASR) against advanced models.

Language Model Can Listen While Speaking,"Ziyang Ma, Yakun Song, Chenpeng Du, Jian Cong, Zhuo Chen, Yuping Wang, Yuxuan Wang, Xie Chen","Dialogue serves as the most natural manner of human-computer interaction (HCI). Recent advancements in speech language models (SLM) have significantly enhanced speech-based conversational AI. However, these models are limited to turn-based conversation, lacking the ability to interact with humans in real-time spoken scenarios, for example, being interrupted when the generated content is not satisfactory. To address these limitations, we explore full duplex modeling (FDM) in interactive speech language models (iSLM), focusing on enhancing real-time interaction and, more explicitly, exploring the quintessential ability of interruption. We introduce a novel model design, namely listening-while-speaking language model (LSLM), an end-to-end system equipped with both listening and speaking channels. Our LSLM employs a token-based decoder-only TTS for speech generation and a streaming self-supervised learning (SSL) encoder for real-time audio input. LSLM fuses both channels for autoregressive generation and detects turn-taking in real time. Three fusion strategies -- early fusion, middle fusion, and late fusion -- are explored, with middle fusion achieving an optimal balance between speech generation and real-time interaction. Two experimental settings, command-based FDM and voice-based FDM, demonstrate LSLM's robustness to noise and sensitivity to diverse instructions. Our results highlight LSLM's capability to achieve duplex communication with minimal impact on existing systems. This study aims to advance the development of interactive speech dialogue systems, enhancing their applicability in real-world contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02622v1,2024-08

Progressively Label Enhancement for Large Language Model Alignment,"Biao Liu, Ning Xu, Xin Geng","Large Language Models (LLM) alignment aims to prevent models from producing content that misaligns with human expectations, which can lead to ethical and legal concerns. In the last few years, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been the most prominent method for achieving alignment. Due to challenges in stability and scalability with RLHF stages, which arise from the complex interactions between multiple models, researchers are exploring alternative methods to achieve effects comparable to those of RLHF. However, these methods often rely on large high-quality datasets. Despite some methods considering the generation of additional data to expand datasets, they often treat model training and data generation as separate and static processes, overlooking the fact that these processes are highly interdependent, leading to inefficient utilization of the generated data. To deal with this problem, we propose PLE, i.e., Progressively Label Enhancement for LLM Alignment, a framework that dynamically adjusts the model's training process based on the evolving quality of the generated data. Specifically, we prompt the model to generate responses for both the original query and the query guided by a set of carefully designed principles, and then utilize a dynamic threshold to determine the appropriate training approach for both responses based on their corresponding reward scores. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PLE compared to existing LLM alignment methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02599v2,2024-08

Given that large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to revolutionize diverse tasks within natural language processing, particularly in the problem of summarization, this paper explores the potential of fine-tuning LLMs for the aspect-based summarization task. We evaluate the impact of fine-tuning open-source foundation LLMs, including Llama2, Mistral, Gemma and Aya, on a publicly available domain-specific aspect based summary dataset. We hypothesize that this approach will enable these models to effectively identify and extract aspect-related information, leading to superior quality aspect-based summaries compared to the state-of-the-art. We establish a comprehensive evaluation framework to compare the performance of fine-tuned LLMs against competing aspect-based summarization methods and vanilla counterparts of the fine-tuned LLMs. Our work contributes to the field of aspect-based summarization by demonstrating the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs for generating high-quality aspect-based summaries.

"VyAnG-Net: A Novel Multi-Modal Sarcasm Recognition Model by Uncovering Visual, Acoustic and Glossary Features","Ananya Pandey, Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma","Various linguistic and non-linguistic clues, such as excessive emphasis on a word, a shift in the tone of voice, or an awkward expression, frequently convey sarcasm. The computer vision problem of sarcasm recognition in conversation aims to identify hidden sarcastic, criticizing, and metaphorical information embedded in everyday dialogue. Prior, sarcasm recognition has focused mainly on text. Still, it is critical to consider all textual information, audio stream, facial expression, and body position for reliable sarcasm identification. Hence, we propose a novel approach that combines a lightweight depth attention module with a self-regulated ConvNet to concentrate on the most crucial features of visual data and an attentional tokenizer based strategy to extract the most critical context-specific information from the textual data. The following is a list of the key contributions that our experimentation has made in response to performing the task of Multi-modal Sarcasm Recognition: an attentional tokenizer branch to get beneficial features from the glossary content provided by the subtitles; a visual branch for acquiring the most prominent features from the video frames; an utterance-level feature extraction from acoustic content and a multi-headed attention based feature fusion branch to blend features obtained from multiple modalities. Extensive testing on one of the benchmark video datasets, MUSTaRD, yielded an accuracy of 79.86% for speaker dependent and 76.94% for speaker independent configuration demonstrating that our approach is superior to the existing methods. We have also conducted a cross-dataset analysis to test the adaptability of VyAnG-Net with unseen samples of another dataset MUStARD++.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10246v1,2024-08

This study investigates the applicability of knowledge acquired by open-source and API-based LLMs to sophisticated text-based games requiring agent collaboration under imperfect information, comparing their performance to established baselines using other types of agents. We propose a Theory of Mind (ToM) planning technique that allows LLM agents to adapt their strategy against various adversaries using only game rules, current state, and historical context as input.

RAG Foundry integrates data creation, training, inference and evaluation into a single workflow, facilitating the creation of data-augmented datasets for training and evaluating large language models in RAG settings. This integration enables rapid prototyping and experimentation with various RAG techniques, allowing users to easily generate datasets and train RAG models using internal or specialized knowledge sources. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness by augmenting and fine-tuning Llama-3 and Phi-3 models with diverse RAG configurations, showcasing consistent improvements across three knowledge-intensive datasets.

Caution for the Environment: Multimodal Agents are Susceptible to Environmental Distractions,"Xinbei Ma, Yiting Wang, Yao Yao, Tongxin Yuan, Aston Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao","This paper investigates the faithfulness of multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents in the graphical user interface (GUI) environment, aiming to address the research question of whether multimodal GUI agents can be distracted by environmental context. A general setting is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using our simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness (i.e., action accuracy) of multimodal agents, our findings indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions, resulting in unfaithful behaviors. Furthermore, we switch to the adversarial perspective and implement environment injection, demonstrating that such unfaithfulness can be exploited, leading to unexpected risks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02544v1,2024-08
OneLove beyond the field -- A few-shot pipeline for topic and sentiment analysis during the FIFA World Cup in Qatar,"Christoph Rauchegger, Sonja Mei Wang, Pieter Delobelle","The FIFA World Cup in Qatar was discussed extensively in the news and on social media. Due to news reports with allegations of human rights violations, there were calls to boycott it. Wearing a OneLove armband was part of a planned protest activity. Controversy around the armband arose when FIFA threatened to sanction captains who wear it. To understand what topics Twitter users Tweeted about and what the opinion of German Twitter users was towards the OneLove armband, we performed an analysis of German Tweets published during the World Cup using in-context learning with LLMs. We validated the labels on human annotations. We found that Twitter users initially discussed the armband's impact, LGBT rights, and politics; after the ban, the conversation shifted towards politics in sports in general, accompanied by a subtle shift in sentiment towards neutrality. Our evaluation serves as a framework for future research to explore the impact of sports activism and evolving public sentiment. This is especially useful in settings where labeling datasets for specific opinions is unfeasible, such as when events are unfolding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02520v1,2024-08
Winning Amazon KDD Cup'24,"Chris Deotte, Ivan Sorokin, Ahmet Erdem, Benedikt Schifferer, Gilberto Titericz Jr, Simon Jegou","This paper describes the winning solution of all 5 tasks for the Amazon KDD Cup 2024 Multi Task Online Shopping Challenge for LLMs. The challenge was to build a useful assistant, answering questions in the domain of online shopping. The competition contained 57 diverse tasks, covering 5 different task types (e.g. multiple choice) and across 4 different tracks (e.g. multi-lingual). Our solution is a single model per track. We fine-tune Qwen2-72B-Instruct on our own training dataset. As the competition released only 96 example questions, we developed our own training dataset by processing multiple public datasets or using Large Language Models for data augmentation and synthetic data generation. We apply wise-ft to account for distribution shifts and ensemble multiple LoRA adapters in one model. We employed Logits Processors to constrain the model output on relevant tokens for the tasks. AWQ 4-bit Quantization and vLLM are used during inference to predict the test dataset in the time constraints of 20 to 140 minutes depending on the track. Our solution achieved the first place in each individual track and is the first place overall of Amazons KDD Cup 2024.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04658v1,2024-08
UnifiedMLLM: Enabling Unified Representation for Multi-modal Multi-tasks With Large Language Model,"Zhaowei Li, Wei Wang, YiQing Cai, Xu Qi, Pengyu Wang, Dong Zhang, Hang Song, Botian Jiang, Zhida Huang, Tao Wang","Significant advancements has recently been achieved in the field of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), demonstrating their remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models are often trained for specific tasks and rely on task-specific input-output formats, limiting their applicability to a broader range of tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Can we develop a unified approach to represent and handle different multi-modal tasks to maximize the generalizability of MLLMs? In this paper, we propose UnifiedMLLM, a comprehensive model designed to represent various tasks using a unified representation. Our model exhibits strong capabilities in comprehending the implicit intent of user instructions and preforming reasoning. In addition to generating textual responses, our model also outputs task tokens and grounding tokens, serving as indicators of task types and task granularity. These outputs are subsequently routed through the task router and directed to specific expert models for task completion. To train our model, we construct a task-specific dataset and an 100k multi-task dataset encompassing complex scenarios. Employing a three-stage training strategy, we equip our model with robust reasoning and task processing capabilities while preserving its generalization capacity and knowledge reservoir. Extensive experiments showcase the impressive performance of our unified representation approach across various tasks, surpassing existing methodologies. Furthermore, our approach exhibits exceptional scalability and generality. Our code, model, and dataset will be available at \url{https://github.com/lzw-lzw/UnifiedMLLM}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02503v1,2024-08
"From LLMs to LLM-based Agents for Software Engineering: A Survey of Current, Challenges and Future","Haolin Jin, Linghan Huang, Haipeng Cai, Jun Yan, Bo Li, Huaming Chen","With the rise of large language models (LLMs), researchers are increasingly exploring their applications in var ious vertical domains, such as software engineering. LLMs have achieved remarkable success in areas including code generation and vulnerability detection. However, they also exhibit numerous limitations and shortcomings. LLM-based agents, a novel tech nology with the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), combine LLMs as the core for decision-making and action-taking, addressing some of the inherent limitations of LLMs such as lack of autonomy and self-improvement. Despite numerous studies and surveys exploring the possibility of using LLMs in software engineering, it lacks a clear distinction between LLMs and LLM based agents. It is still in its early stage for a unified standard and benchmarking to qualify an LLM solution as an LLM-based agent in its domain. In this survey, we broadly investigate the current practice and solutions for LLMs and LLM-based agents for software engineering. In particular we summarise six key topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making, software design, test generation, and software maintenance. We review and differentiate the work of LLMs and LLM-based agents from these six topics, examining their differences and similarities in tasks, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the models and benchmarks used, providing a comprehensive analysis of their applications and effectiveness in software engineering. We anticipate this work will shed some lights on pushing the boundaries of LLM-based agents in software engineering for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02479v1,2024-08
Let Me Speak Freely? A Study on the Impact of Format Restrictions on Performance of Large Language Models,"Zhi Rui Tam, Cheng-Kuang Wu, Yi-Lin Tsai, Chieh-Yen Lin, Hung-yi Lee, Yun-Nung Chen","Structured generation, the process of producing content in standardized formats like JSON and XML, is widely utilized in real-world applications to extract key output information from large language models (LLMs). This study investigates whether such constraints on generation space impact LLMs abilities, including reasoning and domain knowledge comprehension. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs performance when restricted to adhere to structured formats versus generating free-form responses across various common tasks. Surprisingly, we observe a significant decline in LLMs reasoning abilities under format restrictions. Furthermore, we find that stricter format constraints generally lead to greater performance degradation in reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02442v3,2024-08
Long Input Benchmark for Russian Analysis,"Igor Churin, Murat Apishev, Maria Tikhonova, Denis Shevelev, Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, Sergej Averkiev, Alena Fenogenova","Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have fostered the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) that can solve an immense variety of tasks. One of the key aspects of their application is their ability to work with long text documents and to process long sequences of tokens. This has created a demand for proper evaluation of long-context understanding. To address this need for the Russian language, we propose LIBRA (Long Input Benchmark for Russian Analysis), which comprises 21 adapted datasets to study the LLM's abilities to understand long texts thoroughly. The tests are divided into four complexity groups and allow the evaluation of models across various context lengths ranging from 4k up to 128k tokens. We provide the open-source datasets, codebase, and public leaderboard for LIBRA to guide forthcoming research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02439v1,2024-08
Towards Semantic Markup of Mathematical Documents via User Interaction,"Luka Vrečar, Joe Wells, Fairouz Kamareddine","Mathematical documents written in LaTeX often contain ambiguities. We can resolve some of them via semantic markup using, e.g., sTeX, which also has other potential benefits, such as interoperability with computer algebra systems, proof systems, and increased accessibility. However, semantic markup is more involved than ""regular"" typesetting and presents a challenge for authors of mathematical documents. We aim to smooth out the transition from plain LaTeX to semantic markup by developing semi-automatic tools for authors. In this paper we present an approach to semantic markup of formulas by (semi-)automatically generating grammars from existing sTeX macro definitions and parsing mathematical formulas with them. We also present a GUI-based tool for the disambiguation of parse results and showcase its functionality and potential using a grammar for parsing untyped $\lambda$-terms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04656v1,2024-08
"Infusing Emotions into Task-oriented Dialogue Systems: Understanding, Management, and Generation","Shutong Feng, Hsien-chin Lin, Christian Geishauser, Nurul Lubis, Carel van Niekerk, Michael Heck, Benjamin Ruppik, Renato Vukovic, Milica Gašić","Emotions are indispensable in human communication, but are often overlooked in task-oriented dialogue (ToD) modelling, where the task success is the primary focus. While existing works have explored user emotions or similar concepts in some ToD tasks, none has so far included emotion modelling into a fully-fledged ToD system nor conducted interaction with human or simulated users. In this work, we incorporate emotion into the complete ToD processing loop, involving understanding, management, and generation. To this end, we extend the EmoWOZ dataset (Feng et al., 2022) with system affective behaviour labels. Through interactive experimentation involving both simulated and human users, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the user's emotional experience as well as the task success.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02417v1,2024-08
Why Are My Prompts Leaked? Unraveling Prompt Extraction Threats in Customized Large Language Models,"Zi Liang, Haibo Hu, Qingqing Ye, Yaxin Xiao, Haoyang Li","The drastic increase of large language models' (LLMs) parameters has led to a new research direction of fine-tuning-free downstream customization by prompts, i.e., task descriptions. While these prompt-based services (e.g. OpenAI's GPTs) play an important role in many businesses, there has emerged growing concerns about the prompt leakage, which undermines the intellectual properties of these services and causes downstream attacks. In this paper, we analyze the underlying mechanism of prompt leakage, which we refer to as prompt memorization, and develop corresponding defending strategies. By exploring the scaling laws in prompt extraction, we analyze key attributes that influence prompt extraction, including model sizes, prompt lengths, as well as the types of prompts. Then we propose two hypotheses that explain how LLMs expose their prompts. The first is attributed to the perplexity, i.e. the familiarity of LLMs to texts, whereas the second is based on the straightforward token translation path in attention matrices. To defend against such threats, we investigate whether alignments can undermine the extraction of prompts. We find that current LLMs, even those with safety alignments like GPT-4, are highly vulnerable to prompt extraction attacks, even under the most straightforward user attacks. Therefore, we put forward several defense strategies with the inspiration of our findings, which achieve 83.8\% and 71.0\% drop in the prompt extraction rate for Llama2-7B and GPT-3.5, respectively.

Strong and weak alignment of large language models with human values,"Mehdi Khamassi, Marceau Nahon, Raja Chatila","Minimizing negative impacts of Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems on human societies without human supervision requires them to be able to align with human values. However, most current work only addresses this issue from a technical point of view, e.g., improving current methods relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback, neglecting what it means and is required for alignment to occur. Here, we propose to distinguish strong and weak value alignment. Strong alignment requires cognitive abilities (either human-like or different from humans) such as understanding and reasoning about agents' intentions and their ability to causally produce desired effects. We argue that this is required for AI systems like large language models (LLMs) to be able to recognize situations presenting a risk that human values may be flouted. To illustrate this distinction, we present a series of prompts showing ChatGPT's, Gemini's and Copilot's failures to recognize some of these situations. We moreover analyze word embeddings to show that the nearest neighbors of some human values in LLMs differ from humans' semantic representations. We then propose a new thought experiment that we call ""the Chinese room with a word transition dictionary"", in extension of John Searle's famous proposal. We finally mention current promising research directions towards a weak alignment, which could produce statistically satisfying answers in a number of common situations, however so far without ensuring any truth value.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04655v2,2024-08
A Few-Shot Approach for Relation Extraction Domain Adaptation using Large Language Models,"Vanni Zavarella, Juan Carlos Gamero-Salinas, Sergio Consoli","Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been successfully applied to the analysis of complex scientific and technological domains, with automatic KG generation methods typically building upon relation extraction models capturing fine-grained relations between domain entities in text. While these relations are fully applicable across scientific areas, existing models are trained on few domain-specific datasets such as SciERC and do not perform well on new target domains. In this paper, we experiment with leveraging in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models to perform schema-constrained data annotation, collecting in-domain training instances for a Transformer-based relation extraction model deployed on titles and abstracts of research papers in the Architecture, Construction, Engineering and Operations (AECO) domain. By assessing the performance gain with respect to a baseline Deep Learning architecture trained on off-domain data, we show that by using a few-shot learning strategy with structured prompts and only minimal expert annotation the presented approach can potentially support domain adaptation of a science KG generation model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02377v1,2024-08
Dialogue Ontology Relation Extraction via Constrained Chain-of-Thought Decoding,"Renato Vukovic, David Arps, Carel van Niekerk, Benjamin Matthias Ruppik, Hsien-Chin Lin, Michael Heck, Milica Gašić","State-of-the-art task-oriented dialogue systems typically rely on task-specific ontologies for fulfilling user queries. The majority of task-oriented dialogue data, such as customer service recordings, comes without ontology and annotation. Such ontologies are normally built manually, limiting the application of specialised systems. Dialogue ontology construction is an approach for automating that process and typically consists of two steps: term extraction and relation extraction. In this work, we focus on relation extraction in a transfer learning set-up. To improve the generalisation, we propose an extension to the decoding mechanism of large language models. We adapt Chain-of-Thought (CoT) decoding, recently developed for reasoning problems, to generative relation extraction. Here, we generate multiple branches in the decoding space and select the relations based on a confidence threshold. By constraining the decoding to ontology terms and relations, we aim to decrease the risk of hallucination. We conduct extensive experimentation on two widely used datasets and find improvements in performance on target ontology for source fine-tuned and one-shot prompted large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02361v1,2024-08
An approach to optimize inference of the DIART speaker diarization pipeline,"Roman Aperdannier, Sigurd Schacht, Alexander Piazza","Speaker diarization answers the question ""who spoke when"" for an audio file. In some diarization scenarios, low latency is required for transcription. Speaker diarization with low latency is referred to as online speaker diarization. The DIART pipeline is an online speaker diarization system. It consists of a segmentation and an embedding model. The embedding model has the largest share of the overall latency. The aim of this paper is to optimize the inference latency of the DIART pipeline. Different inference optimization methods such as knowledge distilation, pruning, quantization and layer fusion are applied to the embedding model of the pipeline. It turns out that knowledge distillation optimizes the latency, but has a negative effect on the accuracy. Quantization and layer fusion also have a positive influence on the latency without worsening the accuracy. Pruning, on the other hand, does not improve latency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02341v1,2024-08
Batching BPE Tokenization Merges,Alexander P. Morgan,"The Byte Pair Encoding algorithm can be safely batched to merge hundreds of pairs of tokens at a time when building up a tokenizer's vocabulary.

The knowledge base question answering (KBQA) task, utilizing structured knowledge graphs (KG), allows for handling extensive knowledge-intensive questions. However, a significant gap exists in KBQA datasets, especially for low-resource languages. Many existing construction pipelines for these datasets are outdated and inefficient in human labor, and modern assisting tools like Large Language Models (LLM) are not utilized to reduce the workload. To address this, we have designed and implemented a modern, semi-automated approach for creating datasets, encompassing tasks such as KBQA, Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC), and Information Retrieval (IR), tailored explicitly for low-resource environments.

SNFinLLM: Systematic and Nuanced Financial Domain Adaptation of Chinese Large Language Models,"Shujuan Zhao, Lingfeng Qiao, Kangyang Luo, Qian-Wen Zhang, Junru Lu, Di Yin","Large language models (LLMs) have become powerful tools for advancing natural language processing applications in the financial industry. However, existing financial LLMs often face challenges such as hallucinations or superficial parameter training, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in financial computing and machine reading comprehension (MRC). To address these issues, we propose a novel large language model specifically designed for the Chinese financial domain, named SNFinLLM. SNFinLLM excels in domain-specific tasks such as answering questions, summarizing financial research reports, analyzing sentiment, and executing financial calculations. We then perform the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance the model's proficiency across various financial domains. Specifically, we gather extensive financial data and create a high-quality instruction dataset composed of news articles, professional papers, and research reports of finance domain. Utilizing both domain-specific and general datasets, we proceed with continuous pre-training on an established open-source base model, resulting in SNFinLLM-base. Following this, we engage in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to bolster the model's capability across multiple financial tasks. Crucially, we employ a straightforward Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method to better align the model with human preferences. Extensive experiments conducted on finance benchmarks and our evaluation dataset demonstrate that SNFinLLM markedly outperforms other state-of-the-art financial language models.

Decoupled Vocabulary Learning Enables Zero-Shot Translation from Unseen Languages,"Carlos Mullov, Ngoc-Quan Pham, Alexander Waibel","Multilingual neural machine translation systems learn to map sentences of different languages into a common representation space. Intuitively, with a growing number of seen languages the encoder sentence representation grows more flexible and easily adaptable to new languages. In this work, we test this hypothesis by zero-shot translating from unseen languages. To deal with unknown vocabularies from unknown languages we propose a setup where we decouple learning of vocabulary and syntax, i.e. for each language we learn word representations in a separate step (using cross-lingual word embeddings), and then train to translate while keeping those word representations frozen. We demonstrate that this setup enables zero-shot translation from entirely unseen languages. Zero-shot translating with a model trained on Germanic and Romance languages we achieve scores of 42.6 BLEU for Portuguese-English and 20.7 BLEU for Russian-English on TED domain. We explore how this zero-shot translation capability develops with varying number of languages seen by the encoder. Lastly, we explore the effectiveness of our decoupled learning strategy for unsupervised machine translation. By exploiting our model's zero-shot translation capability for iterative back-translation we attain near parity with a supervised setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02290v1,2024-08
Spin glass model of in-context learning,"Yuhao Li, Ruoran Bai, Haiping Huang","Large language models show a surprising in-context learning ability -- being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query, yet without additional training, in stark contrast to old-fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention and map this structure to a spin glass model with real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre-training, and further clarifies why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without further training. Our theory reveals that for single-instance learning, increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of in-context learning, by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed analytically tractable model thus offers a promising avenue for thinking about how to interpret many intriguing but puzzling properties of large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02288v2,2024-08

Deep learning-based video analysis requires extensive data. Consequently, existing works often use web videos as training resources, making it challenging to query instructional contents from raw video observations. To address this issue, we propose a new dataset, COM Kitchens. The dataset consists of unedited overhead-view videos captured by smartphones, in which participants performed food preparation based on given recipes. Fixed-viewpoint video datasets often lack environmental diversity due to high camera setup costs. We used modern wide-angle smartphone lenses to cover cooking counters from sink to cooktop in an overhead view, capturing activity without in-person assistance. With this setup, we collected a diverse dataset by distributing smartphones to participants. With this dataset, we propose the novel video-to-text retrieval task Online Recipe Retrieval (OnRR) and new video captioning domain Dense Video Captioning on unedited Overhead-View videos (DVC-OV).

To address this problem, we propose StyEmp, which aims to stylize the empathetic response generation with a consistent personality. Specifically, it incorporates a multi-grained prefix mechanism designed to capture the intricate relationship between a system's personality and its empathetic expressions. Furthermore, we introduce a personality reinforcement module that leverages contrastive learning to calibrate the generation model, ensuring that responses are both empathetic and reflective of a distinct personality.

A Multi-Source Heterogeneous Knowledge Injected Prompt Learning Method for Legal Charge Prediction,"Jingyun Sun, Chi Wei, Yang Li","Legal charge prediction, an essential task in legal AI, seeks to assign accurate charge labels to case descriptions, attracting significant recent interest. Existing methods primarily employ diverse neural network structures for modeling case descriptions directly, failing to effectively leverage multi-source external knowledge. We propose a prompt learning framework-based method that simultaneously leverages multi-source heterogeneous external knowledge from a legal knowledge base, a conversational LLM, and related legal articles. Specifically, we match knowledge snippets in case descriptions via the legal knowledge base and encapsulate them into the input through a hard prompt template. Additionally, we retrieve legal articles related to a given case description through contrastive learning, and then obtain factual elements within the case description through a conversational LLM. We fuse the embedding vectors of soft prompt tokens with the encoding vector of factual elements to achieve knowledge-enhanced model forward inference. Experimental results show that our method achieved state-of-the-art results on CAIL-2018, the largest legal charge prediction dataset, and our method has lower data dependency.

Given the multi-label nature of the SDG mapping task, we employed metrics such as F1 score, precision, and recall with micro-averaging to evaluate different aspects of the models' performance. These metrics are derived from the confusion matrix to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. We provide a clear observation and analysis of each model's performance by plotting curves based on F1 score, precision, and recall at different thresholds. According to the results of this experiment, LLaMA 2 and Gemma still have significant room for improvement. The other four models do not exhibit particularly large differences in performance. The outputs from all seven models are available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12789375.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02201v1,2024-08
CodeACT: Code Adaptive Compute-efficient Tuning Framework for Code LLMs,"Weijie Lv, Xuan Xia, Sheng-Jun Huang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in code-related tasks, yet open-source models lag behind their closed-source counterparts. To bridge this performance gap, existing methods generate vast amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, leading to inefficiencies in training. Motivated by the need for more effective and efficient training, we propose the Code Adaptive Compute-efficient Tuning (CodeACT) framework. CodeACT introduces the Complexity and Diversity Aware Sampling (CDAS) method to select high-quality training data based on complexity and diversity, and the Dynamic Pack padding strategy to reduce computational resource usage by minimizing padding tokens during training. Experimental results demonstrate that CodeACT-DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, fine-tuned on only 40% of the EVOL-Instruct data, achieves an 8.6% performance increase on HumanEval, reduces training time by 78%, and decreases peak GPU memory usage by 27%. These findings underscore CodeACT's ability to enhance the performance and efficiency of open-source models. By optimizing both the data selection and training processes, CodeACT offers a comprehensive approach to improving the capabilities of open-source LLMs while significantly reducing computational requirements, addressing the dual challenges of data quality and training efficiency, and paving the way for more resource-efficient and performant models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02193v1,2024-08
LLM Agents Improve Semantic Code Search,"Sarthak Jain, Aditya Dora, Ka Seng Sam, Prabhat Singh","Code Search is a key task that many programmers often have to perform while developing solutions to problems. Current methodologies suffer from an inability to perform accurately on prompts that contain some ambiguity or ones that require additional context relative to a code-base. We introduce the approach of using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) powered agents to inject information into user prompts allowing for better inputs into embedding models. By utilizing RAG, agents enhance user queries with relevant details from GitHub repositories, making them more informative and contextually aligned. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stream ensemble approach which when paired with agentic workflow can obtain improved retrieval accuracy, which we deploy on application called repo-rift.com. Experimental results on the CodeSearchNet dataset demonstrate that RepoRift significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving an 78.2% success rate at Success@10 and a 34.6% success rate at Success@1. This research presents a substantial advancement in semantic code search, highlighting the potential of agentic LLMs and RAG to enhance code retrieval systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11058v1,2024-08
Generative Retrieval with Few-shot Indexing,"Arian Askari, Chuan Meng, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Zhaochun Ren, Evangelos Kanoulas, Suzan Verberne","Existing generative retrieval (GR) approaches rely on training-based indexing, i.e., fine-tuning a model to memorise the associations between a query and the document identifier (docid) of a relevant document. Training-based indexing has three limitations: high training overhead, under-utilization of the pre-trained knowledge of large language models (LLMs), and challenges in adapting to a dynamic document corpus. To address the above issues, we propose a novel few-shot indexing-based GR framework (Few-Shot GR). It has a novel few-shot indexing process, where we prompt an LLM to generate docids for all documents in a corpus, ultimately creating a docid bank for the entire corpus. During retrieval, we feed a query to the same LLM and constrain it to generate a docid within the docid bank created during indexing, and then map the generated docid back to its corresponding document. Few-Shot GR relies solely on prompting an LLM without requiring any training, making it more efficient. Moreover, we devise few-shot indexing with one-to-many mapping to further enhance Few-Shot GR. Experiments show that Few-Shot GR achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art GR methods that require heavy training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02152v1,2024-08
Analyzing Cultural Representations of Emotions in LLMs through Mixed Emotion Survey,"Shiran Dudy, Ibrahim Said Ahmad, Ryoko Kitajima, Agata Lapedriza","Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread global adoption, showcasing advanced linguistic capabilities across multiple of languages. There is a growing interest in academia to use these models to simulate and study human behaviors. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that an LLM's proficiency in a specific language might not fully encapsulate the norms and values associated with its culture. Concerns have emerged regarding potential biases towards Anglo-centric cultures and values due to the predominance of Western and US-based training data. This study focuses on analyzing the cultural representations of emotions in LLMs, in the specific case of mixed-emotion situations. Our methodology is based on the studies of Miyamoto et al. (2010), which identified distinctive emotional indicators in Japanese and American human responses. We first administer their mixed emotion survey to five different LLMs and analyze their outputs. Second, we experiment with contextual variables to explore variations in responses considering both language and speaker origin. Thirdly, we expand our investigation to encompass additional East Asian and Western European origin languages to gauge their alignment with their respective cultures, anticipating a closer fit. We find that (1) models have limited alignment with the evidence in the literature; (2) written language has greater effect on LLMs' response than information on participants origin; and (3) LLMs responses were found more similar for East Asian languages than Western European languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02143v1,2024-08
Table Transformers for Imputing Textual Attributes,"Ting-Ruen Wei, Yuan Wang, Yoshitaka Inoue, Hsin-Tai Wu, Yi Fang","Missing data in tabular dataset is a common issue as the performance of downstream tasks usually depends on the completeness of the training dataset. Previous missing data imputation methods focus on numeric and categorical columns, but we propose a novel end-to-end approach called Table Transformers for Imputing Textual Attributes (TTITA) based on the transformer to impute unstructured textual columns using other columns in the table. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, and our approach shows competitive performance outperforming baseline models such as recurrent neural networks and Llama2. The performance improvement is more significant when the target sequence has a longer length. Additionally, we incorporate multi-task learning to simultaneously impute for heterogeneous columns, boosting the performance for text imputation. We also qualitatively compare with ChatGPT for realistic applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02128v2,2024-08
Recent Advances in Multi-Choice Machine Reading Comprehension: A Survey on Methods and Datasets,"Shima Foolad, Kourosh Kiani, Razieh Rastgoo","This paper provides a thorough examination of recent developments in the field of multi-choice Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). Focused on benchmark datasets, methodologies, challenges, and future trajectories, our goal is to offer researchers a comprehensive overview of the current landscape in multi-choice MRC. The analysis delves into 30 existing cloze-style and multiple-choice MRC benchmark datasets, employing a refined classification method based on attributes such as corpus style, domain, complexity, context style, question style, and answer style. This classification system enhances our understanding of each dataset's diverse attributes and categorizes them based on their complexity. Furthermore, the paper categorizes recent methodologies into Fine-tuned and Prompt-tuned methods. Fine-tuned methods involve adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to a specific task through retraining on domain-specific datasets, while prompt-tuned methods use prompts to guide PLM response generation, presenting potential applications in zero-shot or few-shot learning scenarios. By contributing to ongoing discussions, inspiring future research directions, and fostering innovations, this paper aims to propel multi-choice MRC towards new frontiers of achievement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02114v1,2024-08
Effective Demonstration Annotation for In-Context Learning via Language Model-Based Determinantal Point Process,"Peng Wang, Xiaobin Wang, Chao Lou, Shengyu Mao, Pengjun Xie, Yong Jiang","In-context learning (ICL) is a few-shot learning paradigm that involves learning mappings through input-output pairs and appropriately applying them to new instances. Despite the remarkable ICL capabilities demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs), existing works are highly dependent on large-scale labeled support sets, not always feasible in practical scenarios. To refine this approach, we focus primarily on an innovative selective annotation mechanism, which precedes the standard demonstration retrieval. We introduce the Language Model-based Determinant Point Process (LM-DPP) that simultaneously considers the uncertainty and diversity of unlabeled instances for optimal selection. Consequently, this yields a subset for annotation that strikes a trade-off between the two factors. We apply LM-DPP to various language models, including GPT-J, LlaMA, and GPT-3. Experimental results on 9 NLU and 2 Generation datasets demonstrate that LM-DPP can effectively select canonical examples. Further analysis reveals that LLMs benefit most significantly from subsets that are both low uncertainty and high diversity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02103v1,2024-08
Leveraging Large Language Models with Chain-of-Thought and Prompt Engineering for Traffic Crash Severity Analysis and Inference,"Hao Zhen, Yucheng Shi, Yongcan Huang, Jidong J. Yang, Ninghao Liu","Harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), this study explores the use of three state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B, and LLaMA3-70B, for crash severity inference, framing it as a classification task. We generate textual narratives from original traffic crash tabular data using a pre-built template infused with domain knowledge. Additionally, we incorporated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to guide the LLMs in analyzing the crash causes and then inferring the severity. This study also examine the impact of prompt engineering specifically designed for crash severity inference. The LLMs were tasked with crash severity inference to: (1) evaluate the models' capabilities in crash severity analysis, (2) assess the effectiveness of CoT and domain-informed prompt engineering, and (3) examine the reasoning abilities with the CoT framework. Our results showed that LLaMA3-70B consistently outperformed the other models, particularly in zero-shot settings. The CoT and Prompt Engineering techniques significantly enhanced performance, improving logical reasoning and addressing alignment issues. Notably, the CoT offers valuable insights into LLMs' reasoning processes, unleashing their capacity to consider diverse factors such as environmental conditions, driver behavior, and vehicle characteristics in severity analysis and inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04652v1,2024-08
Unleashing the Power of Data Tsunami: A Comprehensive Survey on Data Assessment and Selection for Instruction Tuning of Language Models,"Yulei Qin, Yuncheng Yang, Pengcheng Guo, Gang Li, Hang Shao, Yuchen Shi, Zihan Xu, Yun Gu, Ke Li, Xing Sun","Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between the latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations.

MedSyn: LLM-based Synthetic Medical Text Generation Framework,"Gleb Kumichev, Pavel Blinov, Yulia Kuzkina, Vasily Goncharov, Galina Zubkova, Nikolai Zenovkin, Aleksei Goncharov, Andrey Savchenko","Generating synthetic text addresses the challenge of data availability in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare. This study explores the applicability of synthetic data in real-world medical settings. We introduce MedSyn, a novel medical text generation framework that integrates large language models with a Medical Knowledge Graph (MKG). We use MKG to sample prior medical information for the prompt and generate synthetic clinical notes with GPT-4 and fine-tuned LLaMA models. We assess the benefit of synthetic data through application in the ICD code prediction task. Our research indicates that synthetic data can increase the classification accuracy of vital and challenging codes by up to 17.8% compared to settings without synthetic data. Furthermore, to provide new data for further research in the healthcare domain, we present the largest open-source synthetic dataset of clinical notes for the Russian language, comprising over 41k samples covering 219 ICD-10 codes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02056v1,2024-08
Fine-tuning multilingual language models in Twitter/X sentiment analysis: a study on Eastern-European V4 languages,"Tomáš Filip, Martin Pavlíček, Petr Sosík","The aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a standard NLP task with numerous approaches and benchmarks, where large language models (LLM) represent the current state-of-the-art. We focus on ABSA subtasks based on Twitter/X data in underrepresented languages. On such narrow tasks, small tuned language models can often outperform universal large ones, providing available and cheap solutions.   We fine-tune several LLMs (BERT, BERTweet, Llama2, Llama3, Mistral) for classification of sentiment towards Russia and Ukraine in the context of the ongoing military conflict. The training/testing dataset was obtained from the academic API from Twitter/X during 2023, narrowed to the languages of the V4 countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary). Then we measure their performance under a variety of settings including translations, sentiment targets, in-context learning and more, using GPT4 as a reference model. We document several interesting phenomena demonstrating, among others, that some models are much better fine-tunable on multilingual Twitter tasks than others, and that they can reach the SOTA level with a very small training set. Finally we identify combinations of settings providing the best results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02044v1,2024-08
LLaSA: Large Language and E-Commerce Shopping Assistant,"Shuo Zhang, Boci Peng, Xinping Zhao, Boren Hu, Yun Zhu, Yanjia Zeng, Xuming Hu","The e-commerce platform has evolved rapidly due to its widespread popularity and convenience. Developing an e-commerce shopping assistant for customers is crucial to aiding them in quickly finding desired products and recommending precisely what they need. However, most previous shopping assistants face two main problems: (1) task-specificity, which necessitates the development of different models for various tasks, thereby increasing development costs and limiting effectiveness; and (2) poor generalization, where the trained model performs inadequately on up-to-date products. To resolve these issues, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct an omnipotent assistant, leveraging their adeptness at handling multiple tasks and their superior generalization capability. Nonetheless, LLMs lack inherent knowledge of e-commerce concepts. To address this, we create an instruction dataset comprising 65,000 samples and diverse tasks, termed as EshopInstruct. Through instruction tuning on our dataset, the assistant, named LLaSA, demonstrates the potential to function as an omnipotent assistant. Additionally, we propose various inference optimization strategies to enhance performance with limited inference resources. In the Amazon KDD Cup 2024 Challenge, our proposed method, LLaSA, achieved an overall ranking of 3rd place on ShopBench, including 57 tasks and approximately 20,000 questions, and we secured top-5 rankings in each track, especially in track4, where we achieved the best performance result among all student teams. Our extensive practices fully demonstrate that LLMs possess the great potential to be competent e-commerce shopping assistants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02006v1,2024-08
Optimal and efficient text counterfactuals using Graph Neural Networks,"Dimitris Lymperopoulos, Maria Lymperaiou, Giorgos Filandrianos, Giorgos Stamou","As NLP models become increasingly integral to decision-making processes, the need for explainability and interpretability has become paramount. In this work, we propose a framework that achieves the aforementioned by generating semantically edited inputs, known as counterfactual interventions, which change the model prediction, thus providing a form of counterfactual explanations for the model. We test our framework on two NLP tasks - binary sentiment classification and topic classification - and show that the generated edits are contrastive, fluent and minimal, while the whole process remains significantly faster that other state-of-the-art counterfactual editors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01969v2,2024-08
ML-EAT: A Multilevel Embedding Association Test for Interpretable and Transparent Social Science,"Robert Wolfe, Alexis Hiniker, Bill Howe","This research introduces the Multilevel Embedding Association Test (ML-EAT), a method designed for interpretable and transparent measurement of intrinsic bias in language technologies. The ML-EAT addresses issues of ambiguity and difficulty in interpreting the traditional EAT measurement by quantifying bias at three levels of increasing granularity: the differential association between two target concepts with two attribute concepts; the individual effect size of each target concept with two attribute concepts; and the association between each individual target concept and each individual attribute concept. Using the ML-EAT, this research defines a taxonomy of EAT patterns describing the nine possible outcomes of an embedding association test, each of which is associated with a unique EAT-Map, a novel four-quadrant visualization for interpreting the ML-EAT. Empirical analysis of static and diachronic word embeddings, GPT-2 language models, and a CLIP language-and-image model shows that EAT patterns add otherwise unobservable information about the component biases that make up an EAT; reveal the effects of prompting in zero-shot models; and can also identify situations when cosine similarity is an ineffective metric, rendering an EAT unreliable. Our work contributes a method for rendering bias more observable and interpretable, improving the transparency of computational investigations into human minds and societies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01966v2,2024-08
A Novel Metric for Measuring the Robustness of Large Language Models in Non-adversarial Scenarios,"Samuel Ackerman, Ella Rabinovich, Eitan Farchi, Ateret Anaby-Tavor","We evaluate the robustness of several large language models on multiple datasets. Robustness here refers to the relative insensitivity of the model's answers to meaning-preserving variants of their input. Benchmark datasets are constructed by introducing naturally-occurring, non-malicious perturbations, or by generating semantically equivalent paraphrases of input questions or statements. We further propose a novel metric for assessing a model robustness, and demonstrate its benefits in the non-adversarial scenario by empirical evaluation of several models on the created datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01963v4,2024-08
The Implications of Open Generative Models in Human-Centered Data Science Work: A Case Study with Fact-Checking Organizations,"Robert Wolfe, Tanushree Mitra","Calls to use open generative language models in academic research have highlighted the need for reproducibility and transparency in scientific research. However, the impact of generative AI extends well beyond academia, as corporations and public interest organizations have begun integrating these models into their data science pipelines. We expand this lens to include the impact of open models on organizations, focusing specifically on fact-checking organizations, which use AI to observe and analyze large volumes of circulating misinformation, yet must also ensure the reproducibility and impartiality of their work. We wanted to understand where fact-checking organizations use open models in their data science pipelines; what motivates their use of open models or proprietary models; and how their use of open or proprietary models can inform research on the societal impact of generative AI. To answer these questions, we conducted an interview study with N=24 professionals at 20 fact-checking organizations on six continents. Based on these interviews, we offer a five-component conceptual model of where fact-checking organizations employ generative AI to support or automate parts of their data science pipeline, including Data Ingestion, Data Analysis, Data Retrieval, Data Delivery, and Data Sharing. We then provide taxonomies of fact-checking organizations' motivations for using open models and the limitations that prevent them for further adopting open models, finding that they prefer open models for Organizational Autonomy, Data Privacy and Ownership, Application Specificity, and Capability Transparency. However, they nonetheless use proprietary models due to perceived advantages in Performance, Usability, and Safety, as well as Opportunity Costs related to participation in emerging generative AI ecosystems. Our work provides novel perspective on open models in data-driven organizations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01962v1,2024-08
"Representation Bias of Adolescents in AI: A Bilingual, Bicultural Study","Robert Wolfe, Aayushi Dangol, Bill Howe, Alexis Hiniker","Popular and news media often portray teenagers with sensationalism, as both a risk to society and at risk from society. As AI begins to absorb some of the epistemic functions of traditional media, we study how teenagers in two countries speaking two languages: 1) are depicted by AI, and 2) how they would prefer to be depicted. Specifically, we study the biases about teenagers learned by static word embeddings (SWEs) and generative language models (GLMs), comparing these with the perspectives of adolescents living in the U.S. and Nepal. We find English-language SWEs associate teenagers with societal problems, and more than 50% of the 1,000 words most associated with teenagers in the pretrained GloVe SWE reflect such problems. Given prompts about teenagers, 30% of outputs from GPT2-XL and 29% from LLaMA-2-7B GLMs discuss societal problems, most commonly violence, but also drug use, mental illness, and sexual taboo. Nepali models, while not free of such associations, are less dominated by social problems. Data from workshops with N=13 U.S. adolescents and N=18 Nepalese adolescents show that AI presentations are disconnected from teenage life, which revolves around activities like school and friendship. Participant ratings of how well 20 trait words describe teens are decorrelated from SWE associations, with Pearson's r=.02, n.s. in English FastText and r=.06, n.s. in GloVe; and r=.06, n.s. in Nepali FastText and r=-.23, n.s. in GloVe. U.S. participants suggested AI could fairly present teens by highlighting diversity, while Nepalese participants centered positivity. Participants were optimistic that, if it learned from adolescents, rather than media sources, AI could help mitigate stereotypes. Our work offers an understanding of the ways SWEs and GLMs misrepresent a developmentally vulnerable group and provides a template for less sensationalized characterization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01961v1,2024-08
Dataset Scale and Societal Consistency Mediate Facial Impression Bias in Vision-Language AI,"Robert Wolfe, Aayushi Dangol, Alexis Hiniker, Bill Howe","Multimodal AI models capable of associating images and text hold promise for numerous domains, ranging from automated image captioning to accessibility applications for blind and low-vision users. However, uncertainty about bias has in some cases limited their adoption and availability. In the present work, we study 43 CLIP vision-language models to determine whether they learn human-like facial impression biases, and we find evidence that such biases are reflected across three distinct CLIP model families. We show for the first time that the the degree to which a bias is shared across a society predicts the degree to which it is reflected in a CLIP model. Human-like impressions of visually unobservable attributes, like trustworthiness and sexuality, emerge only in models trained on the largest dataset, indicating that a better fit to uncurated cultural data results in the reproduction of increasingly subtle social biases. Moreover, we use a hierarchical clustering approach to show that dataset size predicts the extent to which the underlying structure of facial impression bias resembles that of facial impression bias in humans. Finally, we show that Stable Diffusion models employing CLIP as a text encoder learn facial impression biases, and that these biases intersect with racial biases in Stable Diffusion XL-Turbo. While pretrained CLIP models may prove useful for scientific studies of bias, they will also require significant dataset curation when intended for use as general-purpose models in a zero-shot setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01959v2,2024-08
Why Perturbing Symbolic Music is Necessary: Fitting the Distribution of Never-used Notes through a Joint Probabilistic Diffusion Model,"Shipei Liu, Xiaoya Fan, Guowei Wu","Existing music generation models are mostly language-based, neglecting the frequency continuity property of notes, resulting in inadequate fitting of rare or never-used notes and thus reducing the diversity of generated samples. We argue that the distribution of notes can be modeled by translational invariance and periodicity, especially using diffusion models to generalize notes by injecting frequency-domain Gaussian noise. However, due to the low-density nature of music symbols, estimating the distribution of notes latent in the high-density solution space poses significant challenges. To address this problem, we introduce the Music-Diff architecture, which fits a joint distribution of notes and accompanying semantic information to generate symbolic music conditionally. We first enhance the fragmentation module for extracting semantics by using event-based notations and the structural similarity index, thereby preventing boundary blurring. As a prerequisite for multivariate perturbation, we introduce a joint pre-training method to construct the progressions between notes and musical semantics while avoiding direct modeling of low-density notes. Finally, we recover the perturbed notes by a multi-branch denoiser that fits multiple noise objectives via Pareto optimization. Our experiments suggest that in contrast to language models, joint probability diffusion models perturbing at both note and semantic levels can provide more sample diversity and compositional regularity. The case study highlights the rhythmic advantages of our model over language- and DDPMs-based models by analyzing the hierarchical structure expressed in the self-similarity metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01950v1,2024-08
Defining and Evaluating Decision and Composite Risk in Language Models Applied to Natural Language Inference,"Ke Shen, Mayank Kejriwal","Despite their impressive performance, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are known to pose important risks. One such set of risks arises from misplaced confidence, whether over-confidence or under-confidence, that the models have in their inference. While the former is well studied, the latter is not, leading to an asymmetry in understanding the comprehensive risk of the model based on misplaced confidence. In this paper, we address this asymmetry by defining two types of risk (decision and composite risk), and proposing an experimental framework consisting of a two-level inference architecture and appropriate metrics for measuring such risks in both discriminative and generative LLMs. The first level relies on a decision rule that determines whether the underlying language model should abstain from inference. The second level (which applies if the model does not abstain) is the model's inference. Detailed experiments on four natural language commonsense reasoning datasets using both an open-source ensemble-based RoBERTa model and ChatGPT, demonstrate the practical utility of the evaluation framework. For example, our results show that our framework can get an LLM to confidently respond to an extra 20.1% of low-risk inference tasks that other methods might misclassify as high-risk, and skip 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered incorrectly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01935v1,2024-08
DiReCT: Diagnostic Reasoning for Clinical Notes via Large Language Models,"Bowen Wang, Jiuyang Chang, Yiming Qian, Guoxin Chen, Junhao Chen, Zhouqiang Jiang, Jiahao Zhang, Yuta Nakashima, Hajime Nagahara","Large language models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable capabilities, spanning a wide range of tasks and applications, including those in the medical domain. Models like GPT-4 excel in medical question answering but may face challenges in the lack of interpretability when handling complex tasks in real clinical settings. We thus introduce the diagnostic reasoning dataset for clinical notes (DiReCT), aiming at evaluating the reasoning ability and interpretability of LLMs compared to human doctors. It contains 511 clinical notes, each meticulously annotated by physicians, detailing the diagnostic reasoning process from observations in a clinical note to the final diagnosis. Additionally, a diagnostic knowledge graph is provided to offer essential knowledge for reasoning, which may not be covered in the training data of existing LLMs. Evaluations of leading LLMs on DiReCT bring out a significant gap between their reasoning ability and that of human doctors, highlighting the critical need for models that can reason effectively in real-world clinical scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01933v2,2024-08
A Semi-supervised Multi-channel Graph Convolutional Network for Query Classification in E-commerce,"Chunyuan Yuan, Ming Pang, Zheng Fang, Xue Jiang, Changping Peng, Zhangang Lin","Query intent classification is an essential module for customers to find desired products on the e-commerce application quickly. Most existing query intent classification methods rely on the users' click behavior as a supervised signal to construct training samples. However, these methods based entirely on posterior labels may lead to serious category imbalance problems because of the Matthew effect in click samples. Compared with popular categories, it is difficult for products under long-tail categories to obtain traffic and user clicks, which makes the models unable to detect users' intent for products under long-tail categories. This in turn aggravates the problem that long-tail categories cannot obtain traffic, forming a vicious circle. In addition, due to the randomness of the user's click, the posterior label is unstable for the query with similar semantics, which makes the model very sensitive to the input, leading to an unstable and incomplete recall of categories.   In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Multi-channel Graph Convolutional Network (SMGCN) to address the above problems from the perspective of label association and semi-supervised learning. SMGCN extends category information and enhances the posterior label by utilizing the similarity score between the query and categories. Furthermore, it leverages the co-occurrence and semantic similarity graph of categories to strengthen the relations among labels and weaken the influence of posterior label instability. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B experiments, and the experimental results show that SMGCN significantly outperforms the strong baselines, which shows its effectiveness and practicality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01928v1,2024-08

The models are adapted for four key Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: summarization, text generation, question answering, and named entity recognition. Our results indicate that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances model performance in each of these tasks, thereby improving their applicability for scientific contexts. This adaptation enables non-experts to efficiently query and extract information within targeted scientific fields, demonstrating the potential of fine-tuned LLMs as a tool for knowledge discovery in the sciences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04651v1,2024-08
Cross-layer Attention Sharing for Large Language Models,"Yongyu Mu, Yuzhang Wu, Yuchun Fan, Chenglong Wang, Hengyu Li, Qiaozhi He, Murun Yang, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu","As large language models (LLMs) evolve, the increase in model depth and parameter number leads to substantial redundancy. To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism, previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to save the computation by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LiSA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LiSA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LiSA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LiSA achieve a 6X compression of Q and K, with maximum throughput improvements of 19.5% for LLaMA3-8B and 32.3% for LLaMA2-7B.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01890v1,2024-08
Re-Invoke: Tool Invocation Rewriting for Zero-Shot Tool Retrieval,"Yanfei Chen, Jinsung Yoon, Devendra Singh Sachan, Qingze Wang, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Mohammadhossein Bateni, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled autonomous agents with complex reasoning and task-fulfillment capabilities using a wide range of tools. However, effectively identifying the most relevant tools for a given task becomes a key bottleneck as the toolset size grows, hindering reliable tool utilization. To address this, we introduce Re-Invoke, an unsupervised tool retrieval method designed to scale effectively to large toolsets without training. Specifically, we first generate a diverse set of synthetic queries that comprehensively cover different aspects of the query space associated with each tool document during the tool indexing phase. Second, we leverage LLM's query understanding capabilities to extract key tool-related context and underlying intents from user queries during the inference phase. Finally, we employ a novel multi-view similarity ranking strategy based on intents to pinpoint the most relevant tools for each query. Our evaluation demonstrates that Re-Invoke significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios, all within a fully unsupervised setting. Notably, on the ToolE datasets, we achieve a 20% relative improvement in nDCG@5 for single-tool retrieval and a 39% improvement for multi-tool retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01875v2,2024-08
MALADE: Orchestration of LLM-powered Agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation for Pharmacovigilance,"Jihye Choi, Nils Palumbo, Prasad Chalasani, Matthew M. Engelhard, Somesh Jha, Anivarya Kumar, David Page","In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), given their remarkable text understanding and generation abilities, there is an unprecedented opportunity to develop new, LLM-based methods for trustworthy medical knowledge synthesis, extraction and summarization. This paper focuses on the problem of Pharmacovigilance (PhV), where the significance and challenges lie in identifying Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from diverse text sources, such as medical literature, clinical notes, and drug labels. Unfortunately, this task is hindered by factors including variations in the terminologies of drugs and outcomes, and ADE descriptions often being buried in large amounts of narrative text. We present MALADE, the first effective collaborative multi-agent system powered by LLM with Retrieval Augmented Generation for ADE extraction from drug label data. This technique involves augmenting a query to an LLM with relevant information extracted from text resources, and instructing the LLM to compose a response consistent with the augmented data. MALADE is a general LLM-agnostic architecture, and its unique capabilities are: (1) leveraging a variety of external sources, such as medical literature, drug labels, and FDA tools (e.g., OpenFDA drug information API), (2) extracting drug-outcome association in a structured format along with the strength of the association, and (3) providing explanations for established associations. Instantiated with GPT-4 Turbo or GPT-4o, and FDA drug label data, MALADE demonstrates its efficacy with an Area Under ROC Curve of 0.90 against the OMOP Ground Truth table of ADEs. Our implementation leverages the Langroid multi-agent LLM framework and can be found at https://github.com/jihyechoi77/malade.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01869v1,2024-08
Efficient Solutions For An Intriguing Failure of LLMs: Long Context Window Does Not Mean LLMs Can Analyze Long Sequences Flawlessly,"Peyman Hosseini, Ignacio Castro, Iacopo Ghinassi, Matthew Purver","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending and analyzing lengthy sequential inputs, owing to their extensive context windows that allow processing millions of tokens in a single forward pass. However, this paper uncovers a surprising limitation: LLMs fall short when handling long input sequences. We investigate this issue using three datasets and two tasks (sentiment analysis and news categorization) across various LLMs, including Claude 3, Gemini Pro, GPT 3.5 Turbo, Llama 3 Instruct, and Mistral Instruct models. To address this limitation, we propose and evaluate ad-hoc solutions that substantially enhance LLMs' performance on long input sequences by up to 50%, while reducing API cost and latency by up to 93% and 50%, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01866v3,2024-08

Tracking Emotional Dynamics in Chat Conversations: A Hybrid Approach using DistilBERT and Emoji Sentiment Analysis,"Ayan Igali, Abdulkhak Abdrakhman, Yerdaut Torekhan, Pakizar Shamoi","Computer-mediated communication has become more important than face-to-face communication in many contexts. Tracking emotional dynamics in chat conversations can enhance communication, improve services, and support well-being in various contexts. This paper explores a hybrid approach to tracking emotional dynamics in chat conversations by combining DistilBERT-based text emotion detection and emoji sentiment analysis. A Twitter dataset was analyzed using various machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. We contrasted their performance with DistilBERT. Results reveal DistilBERT's superior performance in emotion recognition. Our approach accounts for emotive expressions conveyed through emojis to better understand participants' emotions during chats. We demonstrate how this approach can effectively capture and analyze emotional shifts in real-time conversations. Our findings show that integrating text and emoji analysis is an effective way of tracking chat emotion, with possible applications in customer service, work chats, and social media interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01838v1,2024-08
Chain of Stance: Stance Detection with Large Language Models,"Junxia Ma, Changjiang Wang, Hanwen Xing, Dongming Zhao, Yazhou Zhang","Stance detection is an active task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to identify the author's stance towards a particular target within a text. Given the remarkable language understanding capabilities and encyclopedic prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs), how to explore the potential of LLMs in stance detection has received significant attention. Unlike existing LLM-based approaches that focus solely on fine-tuning with large-scale datasets, we propose a new prompting method, called \textit{Chain of Stance} (CoS). In particular, it positions LLMs as expert stance detectors by decomposing the stance detection process into a series of intermediate, stance-related assertions that culminate in the final judgment. This approach leads to significant improvements in classification performance. We conducted extensive experiments using four SOTA LLMs on the SemEval 2016 dataset, covering the zero-shot and few-shot learning setups. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with an F1 score of 79.84 in the few-shot setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04649v1,2024-08
STBLLM: Breaking the 1-Bit Barrier with Structured Binary LLMs,"Peijie Dong, Lujun Li, Yuedong Zhong, Dayou Du, Ruibo Fan, Yuhan Chen, Zhenheng Tang, Qiang Wang, Wei Xue, Yike Guo, Xiaowen Chu","In this paper, we present the first structural binarization method for LLM compression to less than 1-bit precision. Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, their memory-bound nature during the inference stage hinders the adoption of resource-constrained devices. Reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization substantially enhances computational efficiency. We observe that some weights in binarized LLMs can be randomly flipped without significant performance degradation, suggesting the potential for further compression. To exploit this, our STBLLM employs an N:M sparsity technique to achieve structural binarization of the weights. Specifically, we introduce a novel Standardized Importance (SI) metric, which considers weight magnitude and input feature norm to more accurately assess weight significance. Then, we propose a layer-wise approach, allowing different layers of the LLM to be sparsified with varying N:M ratios, thereby balancing compression and accuracy. Furthermore, we implement a fine-grained grouping strategy for less important weights, applying distinct quantization schemes to sparse, intermediate, and dense regions. Finally, we design a specialized CUDA kernel to support structural binarization. We conduct extensive experiments on LLaMA-1/2/3, OPT family, and Mistral to evaluate the effectiveness of STBLLM. The results demonstrate that our approach performs better than other compressed binarization LLM methods while significantly reducing memory requirements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01803v2,2024-08
MathLearner: A Large Language Model Agent Framework for Learning to Solve Mathematical Problems,"Wenbei Xie, Donglin Liu, Haoran Yan, Wenjie Wu, Zongyang Liu","With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLM) are widely used in many fields. However, the reasoning ability of LLM is still very limited when it comes to mathematical reasoning. Mathematics plays an important role in all aspects of human society and is a technical guarantee in the fields of healthcare, transport and aerospace, for this reason, the development of AI big language models in the field of mathematics has great potential significance. To improve the mathematical reasoning ability of large language models, we proposed an agent framework for learning to solve mathematical problems based on inductive reasoning. By emulating the human learning process of generalization of learned information and effective application of previous knowledge in new reasoning tasks, this framework has great performance in the mathematical reasoning process. It improves global accuracy over the baseline method (chain-of-thought) by 20.96% and solves 17.54% of the mathematical problems that the baseline cannot solve. Benefiting from the efficient RETRIEVAL method, our model improves the ability of large language models to efficiently use external knowledge, i.e., the mathematical computation of the model can be based on written procedures. In education, our model can be used as a personalised learning aid, thus reducing the inequality of educational resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01779v1,2024-08

Distinguishing Chatbot from Human,"Gauri Anil Godghase, Rishit Agrawal, Tanush Obili, Mark Stamp","There have been many recent advances in the fields of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM), with the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model being a leading ""chatbot."" LLM-based chatbots have become so powerful that it may seem difficult to differentiate between human-written and machine-generated text. To analyze this problem, we have developed a new dataset consisting of more than 750,000 human-written paragraphs, with a corresponding chatbot-generated paragraph for each. Based on this dataset, we apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to determine the origin of text (human or chatbot). Specifically, we consider two methodologies for tackling this issue: feature analysis and embeddings. Our feature analysis approach involves extracting a collection of features from the text for classification. We also explore the use of contextual embeddings and transformer-based architectures to train classification models. Our proposed solutions offer high classification accuracy and serve as useful tools for textual analysis, resulting in a better understanding of chatbot-generated text in this era of advanced AI technology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04647v1,2024-08
Discovery of Rare Causal Knowledge from Financial Statement Summaries,"Hiroki Sakaji, Jason Bennett, Risa Murono, Kiyoshi Izumi, Hiroyuki Sakai","What would happen if temperatures were subdued and result in a cool summer? One can easily imagine that air conditioner, ice cream or beer sales would be suppressed as a result of this. Less obvious is that agricultural shipments might be delayed, or that sound proofing material sales might decrease. The ability to extract such causal knowledge is important, but it is also important to distinguish between cause-effect pairs that are known and those that are likely to be unknown, or rare. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method for extracting rare causal knowledge from Japanese financial statement summaries produced by companies. Our method consists of three steps. First, it extracts sentences that include causal knowledge from the summaries using a machine learning method based on an extended language ontology. Second, it obtains causal knowledge from the extracted sentences using syntactic patterns. Finally, it extracts the rarest causal knowledge from the knowledge it has obtained.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01748v1,2024-08
Indexing and Visualization of Climate Change Narratives Using BERT and Causal Extraction,"Hiroki Sakaji, Noriyasu Kaneda","In this study, we propose a methodology to extract, index, and visualize ``climate change narratives'' (stories about the connection between causal and consequential events related to climate change). We use two natural language processing methods, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and causal extraction, to textually analyze newspaper articles on climate change to extract ``climate change narratives.'' The novelty of the methodology could extract and quantify the causal relationships assumed by the newspaper's writers. Looking at the extracted climate change narratives over time, we find that since 2018, an increasing number of narratives suggest the impact of the development of climate change policy discussion and the implementation of climate change-related policies on corporate behaviors, macroeconomics, and price dynamics. We also observed the recent emergence of narratives focusing on the linkages between climate change-related policies and monetary policy. Furthermore, there is a growing awareness of the negative impacts of natural disasters (e.g., abnormal weather and severe floods) related to climate change on economic activities, and this issue might be perceived as a new challenge for companies and governments. The methodology of this study is expected to be applied to a wide range of fields, as it can analyze causal relationships among various economic topics, including analysis of inflation expectation or monetary policy communication strategy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01745v1,2024-08

In addition to preparing monthly reports on fund management, fund managers prepare management reports that summarize these monthly reports every six months or once a year. The preparation of fund reports is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Therefore, in this paper, we tackle investment summarization from monthly reports using transformer-based models. There are two main types of summarization methods: extractive summarization and abstractive summarization, and this study constructs both methods and examines which is more useful in summarizing investment reports.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01744v1,2024-08

In this paper, we propose a hybrid methodology that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in conjunction with Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and validate data contained in these documents. We consider a case study focused on test data related to electronic boards for satellites. To do so, we extend the Semantic Sensor Network ontology. We store the metadata of the reports in a KG, while the actual test results are stored in parquet accessible via a Virtual Knowledge Graph. The validation process is managed using an LLM-based approach. We also conduct a benchmarking study to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in executing this task.

Transforming Slot Schema Induction with Generative Dialogue State Inference,"James D. Finch, Boxin Zhao, Jinho D. Choi","The challenge of defining a slot schema to represent the state of a task-oriented dialogue system is addressed by Slot Schema Induction (SSI), which aims to automatically induce slots from unlabeled dialogue data. Whereas previous approaches induce slots by clustering value spans extracted directly from the dialogue text, we demonstrate the power of discovering slots using a generative approach. By training a model to generate slot names and values that summarize key dialogue information with no prior task knowledge, our SSI method discovers high-quality candidate information for representing dialogue state. These discovered slot-value candidates can be easily clustered into unified slot schemas that align well with human-authored schemas. Experimental comparisons on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets demonstrate that Generative Dialogue State Inference (GenDSI) outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on multiple aspects of the SSI task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01638v1,2024-08
Self-Emotion Blended Dialogue Generation in Social Simulation Agents,"Qiang Zhang, Jason Naradowsky, Yusuke Miyao","When engaging in conversations, dialogue agents in a virtual simulation environment may exhibit their own emotional states that are unrelated to the immediate conversational context, a phenomenon known as self-emotion. This study explores how such self-emotion affects the agents' behaviors in dialogue strategies and decision-making within a large language model (LLM)-driven simulation framework. In a dialogue strategy prediction experiment, we analyze the dialogue strategy choices employed by agents both with and without self-emotion, comparing them to those of humans. The results show that incorporating self-emotion helps agents exhibit more human-like dialogue strategies. In an independent experiment comparing the performance of models fine-tuned on GPT-4 generated dialogue datasets, we demonstrate that self-emotion can lead to better overall naturalness and humanness. Finally, in a virtual simulation environment where agents have discussions on multiple topics, we show that self-emotion of agents can significantly influence the decision-making process of the agents, leading to approximately a 50% change in decisions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01633v1,2024-08

Efficacy of Large Language Models in Systematic Reviews,"Aaditya Shah, Shridhar Mehendale, Siddha Kanthi","This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interpreting existing literature through a systematic review of the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors and financial performance. The primary objective is to assess how LLMs can replicate a systematic review on a corpus of ESG-focused papers. We compiled and hand-coded a database of 88 relevant papers published from March 2020 to May 2024. Additionally, we used a set of 238 papers from a previous systematic review of ESG literature from January 2015 to February 2020. We evaluated two current state-of-the-art LLMs, Meta AI's Llama 3 8B and OpenAI's GPT-4o, on the accuracy of their interpretations relative to human-made classifications on both sets of papers. We then compared these results to a ""Custom GPT"" and a fine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model using the corpus of 238 papers as training data. The fine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model outperformed the base LLMs by 28.3% on average in overall accuracy on prompt 1.

Evaluating the Impact of Advanced LLM Techniques on AI-Lecture Tutors for a Robotics Course,"Sebastian Kahl, Felix Löffler, Martin Maciol, Fabian Ridder, Marius Schmitz, Jennifer Spanagel, Jens Wienkamp, Christopher Burgahn, Malte Schilling","This study evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an Artificial Intelligence-based tutor for a university course. In particular, different advanced techniques are utilized, such as prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. We assessed the different models and applied techniques using common similarity metrics like BLEU-4, ROUGE, and BERTScore, complemented by a small human evaluation of helpfulness and trustworthiness. Our findings indicate that RAG combined with prompt engineering significantly enhances model responses and produces better factual answers. In the context of education, RAG appears as an ideal technique as it is based on enriching the input of the model with additional information and material which usually is already present for a university course. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, can produce quite small, still strong expert models, but poses the danger of overfitting. Our study further asks how we measure performance of LLMs and how well current measurements represent correctness or relevance? We find high correlation on similarity metrics and a bias of most of these metrics towards shorter responses. Overall, our research points to both the potential and challenges of integrating LLMs in educational settings, suggesting a need for balanced training approaches and advanced evaluation frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04645v1,2024-08
Using LLMs to Establish Implicit User Sentiment of Software Desirability,"Sherri Weitl-Harms, John D. Hastings, Jonah Lum","This study explores the use of LLMs for providing quantitative zero-shot sentiment analysis of implicit software desirability, addressing a critical challenge in product evaluation where traditional review scores, though convenient, fail to capture the richness of qualitative user feedback. Innovations include establishing a method that 1) works with qualitative user experience data without the need for explicit review scores, 2) focuses on implicit user satisfaction, and 3) provides scaled numerical sentiment analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of user sentiment, instead of simply classifying sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.   Data is collected using the Microsoft Product Desirability Toolkit (PDT), a well-known qualitative user experience analysis tool. For initial exploration, the PDT metric was given to users of two software systems. PDT data was fed through several LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3 and 3.5, GPT4, and GPT4o) and through a leading transfer learning technique, Twitter-Roberta-Base-Sentiment, and Vader, a leading sentiment analysis tool. Each system was asked to evaluate the data in two ways, by looking at the sentiment expressed in the PDT word/explanation pairs; and by looking at the sentiment expressed by the users in their grouped selection of five words and explanations, as a whole. Each LLM provided a sentiment score, its confidence (low, medium, high) in the score, and an explanation of the score.   All LLMs tested were able to statistically detect user sentiment from the users' grouped data, whereas TRBS and Vader were not. The confidence and explanation of confidence provided by the LLMs assisted in understanding user sentiment. This study adds deeper understanding of evaluating user experiences, toward the goal of creating a universal tool that quantifies implicit sentiment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01527v2,2024-08
MoDE: Effective Multi-task Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning with a Mixture of Dyadic Experts,"Lin Ning, Harsh Lara, Meiqi Guo, Abhinav Rastogi","Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have revolutionized the adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to diverse tasks. Recent efforts have explored mixtures of LoRA modules for multi-task settings. However, our analysis reveals redundancy in the down-projection matrices of these architectures. This observation motivates our proposed method, Mixture of Dyadic Experts (MoDE), which introduces a novel design for efficient multi-task adaptation. This is done by sharing the down-projection matrix across tasks and employing atomic rank-one adapters, coupled with routers that allow more sophisticated task-level specialization. Our design allows for more fine-grained mixing, thereby increasing the model's ability to jointly handle multiple tasks. We evaluate MoDE on the Supernatural Instructions (SNI) benchmark consisting of a diverse set of 700+ tasks and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, without introducing additional parameters. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of parameter efficiency in multi-task LLM adaptation and provide a practical solution for deploying high-performing, lightweight models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01505v1,2024-08
Prompt Recursive Search: A Living Framework with Adaptive Growth in LLM Auto-Prompting,"Xiangyu Zhao, Chengqian Ma","Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable proficiency in addressing a diverse array of tasks within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, with various prompt design strategies significantly augmenting their capabilities. However, these prompts, while beneficial, each possess inherent limitations. The primary prompt design methodologies are twofold: The first, exemplified by the Chain of Thought (CoT), involves manually crafting prompts specific to individual datasets, hence termed Expert-Designed Prompts (EDPs). Once these prompts are established, they are unalterable, and their effectiveness is capped by the expertise of the human designers. When applied to LLMs, the static nature of EDPs results in a uniform approach to both simple and complex problems within the same dataset, leading to the inefficient use of tokens for straightforward issues. The second method involves prompts autonomously generated by the LLM, known as LLM-Derived Prompts (LDPs), which provide tailored solutions to specific problems, mitigating the limitations of EDPs. However, LDPs may encounter a decline in performance when tackling complex problems due to the potential for error accumulation during the solution planning process. To address these challenges, we have conceived a novel Prompt Recursive Search (PRS) framework that leverages the LLM to generate solutions specific to the problem, thereby conserving tokens. The framework incorporates an assessment of problem complexity and an adjustable structure, ensuring a reduction in the likelihood of errors. We have substantiated the efficacy of PRS framework through extensive experiments using LLMs with different numbers of parameters across a spectrum of datasets in various domains. Compared to the CoT method, the PRS method has increased the accuracy on the BBH dataset by 8% using Llama3-7B model, achieving a 22% improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01423v1,2024-08
Mission Impossible: A Statistical Perspective on Jailbreaking LLMs,"Jingtong Su, Julia Kempe, Karen Ullrich","Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a deluge of text data with limited quality control. As a result, LLMs can exhibit unintended or even harmful behaviours, such as leaking information, fake news or hate speech. Countermeasures, commonly referred to as preference alignment, include fine-tuning the pretrained LLMs with carefully crafted text examples of desired behaviour. Even then, empirical evidence shows preference aligned LLMs can be enticed to harmful behaviour. This so called jailbreaking of LLMs is typically achieved by adversarially modifying the input prompt to the LLM. Our paper provides theoretical insights into the phenomenon of preference alignment and jailbreaking from a statistical perspective. Under our framework, we first show that pretrained LLMs will mimic harmful behaviour if present in the training corpus. Under that same framework, we then introduce a statistical notion of alignment, and lower-bound the jailbreaking probability, showing that it is unpreventable under reasonable assumptions. Based on our insights, we propose an alteration to the currently prevalent alignment strategy RLHF. Specifically, we introduce a simple modification to the RLHF objective, we call E-RLHF, that aims to increase the likelihood of safe responses. E-RLHF brings no additional training cost, and is compatible with other methods. Empirically, we demonstrate that E-RLHF outperforms RLHF on all alignment problems put forward by the AdvBench and HarmBench project without sacrificing model performance as measured by the MT-Bench project.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01420v1,2024-08
DebateQA: Evaluating Question Answering on Debatable Knowledge,"Rongwu Xu, Xuan Qi, Zehan Qi, Wei Xu, Zhijiang Guo","The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled us to seek answers to inherently debatable questions on LLM chatbots, necessitating a reliable way to evaluate their ability. However, traditional QA benchmarks assume fixed answers are inadequate for this purpose. To address this, we introduce DebateQA, a dataset of 2,941 debatable questions, each accompanied by multiple human-annotated partial answers that capture a variety of perspectives. We develop two metrics: Perspective Diversity, which evaluates the comprehensiveness of perspectives, and Dispute Awareness, which assesses if the LLM acknowledges the question's debatable nature. Experiments demonstrate that both metrics align with human preferences and are stable across different underlying models. Using DebateQA with two metrics, we assess 12 popular LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation methods. Our findings reveal that while LLMs generally excel at recognizing debatable issues, their ability to provide comprehensive answers encompassing diverse perspectives varies considerably.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01419v1,2024-08
"Talk Less, Interact Better: Evaluating In-context Conversational Adaptation in Multimodal LLMs","Yilun Hua, Yoav Artzi","Humans spontaneously use increasingly efficient language as interactions progress, by adapting and forming ad-hoc conventions. This phenomenon has been studied extensively using reference games, showing properties of human language that go beyond relaying intents. It remains unexplored whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) similarly increase communication efficiency during interactions, and what mechanisms they may adopt for this purpose. We introduce ICCA, an automated framework to evaluate such conversational adaptation as an in-context behavior in MLLMs. We evaluate several state-of-the-art MLLMs, and observe that while they may understand the increasingly efficient language of their interlocutor, they do not spontaneously make their own language more efficient over time. This latter ability can only be elicited in some models (e.g., GPT-4) with heavy-handed prompting. This shows that this property of linguistic interaction does not arise from current training regimes, even though it is a common hallmark of human language. ICCA is available at https://github.com/lil-lab/ICCA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01417v1,2024-08
Pre-trained Language Models Improve the Few-shot Prompt Ability of Decision Transformer,"Yu Yang, Pan Xu","Decision Transformer (DT) has emerged as a promising class of algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, leveraging pre-collected datasets and Transformer's capability to model long sequences. Recent works have demonstrated that using parts of trajectories from training tasks as prompts in DT enhances its performance on unseen tasks, giving rise to Prompt-DT methods. However, collecting data from specific environments can be both costly and unsafe in many scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance and limited few-shot prompt abilities due to the data-hungry nature of Transformer-based models. Additionally, the limited datasets used in pre-training make it challenging for Prompt-DT type of methods to distinguish between various RL tasks through prompts alone. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language model-initialized Prompt Decision Transformer (LPDT), which leverages pre-trained language models for meta-RL tasks and fine-tunes the model using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA). We further incorporate prompt regularization to effectively differentiate between tasks based on prompt feature representations. Our approach integrates pre-trained language model and RL tasks seamlessly. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that initializing with a pre-trained language model significantly enhances the performance of Prompt-DT on unseen tasks compared to baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01402v1,2024-08
Improving Multilingual Neural Machine Translation by Utilizing Semantic and Linguistic Features,"Mengyu Bu, Shuhao Gu, Yang Feng","The many-to-many multilingual neural machine translation can be regarded as the process of integrating semantic features from the source sentences and linguistic features from the target sentences. To enhance zero-shot translation, models need to share knowledge across languages, which can be achieved through auxiliary tasks for learning a universal representation or cross-lingual mapping. To this end, we propose to exploit both semantic and linguistic features between multiple languages to enhance multilingual translation. On the encoder side, we introduce a disentangling learning task that aligns encoder representations by disentangling semantic and linguistic features, thus facilitating knowledge transfer while preserving complete information. On the decoder side, we leverage a linguistic encoder to integrate low-level linguistic features to assist in the target language generation. Experimental results on multilingual datasets demonstrate significant improvement in zero-shot translation compared to the baseline system, while maintaining performance in supervised translation. Further analysis validates the effectiveness of our method in leveraging both semantic and linguistic features. The code is available at https://github.com/ictnlp/SemLing-MNMT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01394v1,2024-08
Coalitions of Large Language Models Increase the Robustness of AI Agents,"Prattyush Mangal, Carol Mak, Theo Kanakis, Timothy Donovan, Dave Braines, Edward Pyzer-Knapp","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally altered the way we interact with digital systems and have led to the pursuit of LLM powered AI agents to assist in daily workflows. LLMs, whilst powerful and capable of demonstrating some emergent properties, are not logical reasoners and often struggle to perform well at all sub-tasks carried out by an AI agent to plan and execute a workflow. While existing studies tackle this lack of proficiency by generalised pretraining at a huge scale or by specialised fine-tuning for tool use, we assess if a system comprising of a coalition of pretrained LLMs, each exhibiting specialised performance at individual sub-tasks, can match the performance of single model agents. The coalition of models approach showcases its potential for building robustness and reducing the operational costs of these AI agents by leveraging traits exhibited by specific models. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning can be mitigated by considering a coalition of pretrained models and believe that this approach can be applied to other non-agentic systems which utilise LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01380v1,2024-08
Transformers are Universal In-context Learners,"Takashi Furuya, Maarten V. de Hoop, Gabriel Peyré","Transformers are deep architectures that define ""in-context mappings"" which enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In this work, we study in particular the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly address their expressivity, we consider the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution of tokens which becomes discrete for a finite number of these. The relevant notion of smoothness then corresponds to continuity in terms of the Wasserstein distance between these contexts. We demonstrate that deep transformers are universal and can approximate continuous in-context mappings to arbitrary precision, uniformly over compact token domains. A key aspect of our results, compared to existing findings, is that for a fixed precision, a single transformer can operate on an arbitrary (even infinite) number of tokens. Additionally, it operates with a fixed embedding dimension of tokens (this dimension does not increase with precision) and a fixed number of heads (proportional to the dimension). The use of MLPs between multi-head attention layers is also explicitly controlled. We consider both unmasked attentions (as used for the vision transformer) and masked causal attentions (as used for NLP and time series applications). We tackle the causal setting leveraging a space-time lifting to analyze causal attention as a mapping over probability distributions of tokens.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01367v2,2024-08
Toward Automatic Relevance Judgment using Vision--Language Models for Image--Text Retrieval Evaluation,"Jheng-Hong Yang, Jimmy Lin","Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated success across diverse applications, yet their potential to assist in relevance judgments remains uncertain. This paper assesses the relevance estimation capabilities of VLMs, including CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4V, within a large-scale \textit{ad hoc} retrieval task tailored for multimedia content creation in a zero-shot fashion. Preliminary experiments reveal the following: (1) Both LLaVA and GPT-4V, encompassing open-source and closed-source visual-instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), achieve notable Kendall's $\tau \sim 0.4$ when compared to human relevance judgments, surpassing the CLIPScore metric. (2) While CLIPScore is strongly preferred, LLMs are less biased towards CLIP-based retrieval systems. (3) GPT-4V's score distribution aligns more closely with human judgments than other models, achieving a Cohen's $\kappa$ value of around 0.08, which outperforms CLIPScore at approximately -0.096. These findings underscore the potential of LLM-powered VLMs in enhancing relevance judgments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01363v1,2024-08
Prompt Refinement or Fine-tuning? Best Practices for using LLMs in Computational Social Science Tasks,"Anders Giovanni Møller, Luca Maria Aiello","Large Language Models are expressive tools that enable complex tasks of text understanding within Computational Social Science. Their versatility, while beneficial, poses a barrier for establishing standardized best practices within the field. To bring clarity on the values of different strategies, we present an overview of the performance of modern LLM-based classification methods on a benchmark of 23 social knowledge tasks. Our results point to three best practices: select models with larger vocabulary and pre-training corpora; avoid simple zero-shot in favor of AI-enhanced prompting; fine-tune on task-specific data, and consider more complex forms instruction-tuning on multiple datasets only when only training data is more abundant.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01346v1,2024-08
MuChoMusic: Evaluating Music Understanding in Multimodal Audio-Language Models,"Benno Weck, Ilaria Manco, Emmanouil Benetos, Elio Quinton, George Fazekas, Dmitry Bogdanov","Multimodal models that jointly process audio and language hold great promise in audio understanding and are increasingly being adopted in the music domain. By allowing users to query via text and obtain information about a given audio input, these models have the potential to enable a variety of music understanding tasks via language-based interfaces. However, their evaluation poses considerable challenges, and it remains unclear how to effectively assess their ability to correctly interpret music-related inputs with current methods. Motivated by this, we introduce MuChoMusic, a benchmark for evaluating music understanding in multimodal language models focused on audio. MuChoMusic comprises 1,187 multiple-choice questions, all validated by human annotators, on 644 music tracks sourced from two publicly available music datasets, and covering a wide variety of genres. Questions in the benchmark are crafted to assess knowledge and reasoning abilities across several dimensions that cover fundamental musical concepts and their relation to cultural and functional contexts. Through the holistic analysis afforded by the benchmark, we evaluate five open-source models and identify several pitfalls, including an over-reliance on the language modality, pointing to a need for better multimodal integration.

FANNO: Augmenting High-Quality Instruction Data with Open-Sourced LLMs Only,"He Zhu, Junyou Su, Tianle Lun, Yicheng Tao, Wenjia Zhang, Zipei Fan, Guanhua Chen","Instruction fine-tuning stands as a crucial advancement in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for enhanced task performance. However, the annotation of instruction datasets has traditionally been expensive and laborious, often relying on manual annotations or costly API calls of proprietary LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce FANNO, a fully autonomous, open-sourced framework that revolutionizes the annotation process without the need for pre-existing annotated data. Utilizing a Mistral-7b-instruct model, FANNO efficiently produces diverse and high-quality datasets through a structured process involving document pre-screening, instruction generation, and response generation. Experiments on Open LLM Leaderboard and AlpacaEval benchmark show that the FANNO can generate high-quality data with diversity and complexity for free, comparable to human-annotated or cleaned datasets like Alpaca-GPT4-Cleaned.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01323v1,2024-08
Reconsidering Degeneration of Token Embeddings with Definitions for Encoder-based Pre-trained Language Models,"Ying Zhang, Dongyuan Li, Manabu Okumura","Learning token embeddings based on token co-occurrence statistics has proven effective for both pre-training and fine-tuning in natural language processing. However, recent studies have pointed out that the distribution of learned embeddings degenerates into anisotropy (i.e., non-uniform distribution), and even pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from a loss of semantics-related information in embeddings for low-frequency tokens. This study first analyzes the fine-tuning dynamics of encoder-based PLMs and demonstrates their robustness against degeneration. On the basis of this analysis, we propose DefinitionEMB, a method that utilizes definitions to re-construct isotropically distributed and semantics-related token embeddings for encoder-based PLMs while maintaining original robustness during fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging definitions from Wiktionary to re-construct such embeddings for two encoder-based PLMs: RoBERTa-base and BART-large. Furthermore, the re-constructed embeddings for low-frequency tokens improve the performance of these models across various GLUE and four text summarization datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01308v2,2024-08
Deep Learning based Visually Rich Document Content Understanding: A Survey,"Yihao Ding, Jean Lee, Soyeon Caren Han","Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) are essential in academia, finance, medical fields, and marketing due to their multimodal information content. Traditional methods for extracting information from VRDs depend on expert knowledge and manual labor, making them costly and inefficient. The advent of deep learning has revolutionized this process, introducing models that leverage multimodal information vision, text, and layout along with pretraining tasks to develop comprehensive document representations. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of information extraction from VRDs. In response to the growing demands and rapid developments in Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), this paper provides a comprehensive review of deep learning-based VRDU frameworks. We systematically survey and analyze existing methods and benchmark datasets, categorizing them based on adopted strategies and downstream tasks. Furthermore, we compare different techniques used in VRDU models, focusing on feature representation and fusion, model architecture, and pretraining methods, while highlighting their strengths, limitations, and appropriate scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging trends and challenges in VRDU, offering insights into future research directions and practical applications. This survey aims to provide a thorough understanding of VRDU advancements, benefiting both academic and industrial sectors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01287v1,2024-08
The Mismeasure of Man and Models: Evaluating Allocational Harms in Large Language Models,"Hannah Chen, Yangfeng Ji, David Evans","Large language models (LLMs) are now being considered and even deployed for applications that support high-stakes decision-making, such as recruitment and clinical decisions. While several methods have been proposed for measuring bias, there remains a gap between predictions, which are what the proposed methods consider, and how they are used to make decisions. In this work, we introduce Rank-Allocational-Based Bias Index (RABBI), a model-agnostic bias measure that assesses potential allocational harms arising from biases in LLM predictions. We compare RABBI and current bias metrics on two allocation decision tasks. We evaluate their predictive validity across ten LLMs and utility for model selection. Our results reveal that commonly-used bias metrics based on average performance gap and distribution distance fail to reliably capture group disparities in allocation outcomes, whereas RABBI exhibits a strong correlation with allocation disparities. Our work highlights the need to account for how models are used in contexts with limited resource constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01285v1,2024-08
RAGEval: Scenario Specific RAG Evaluation Dataset Generation Framework,"Kunlun Zhu, Yifan Luo, Dingling Xu, Ruobing Wang, Shi Yu, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that enables large language models (LLMs) to incorporate external knowledge. However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to rigorously evaluate LLM-generated responses. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations.

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Clinical Text Using Large Language Models,"Daniel B. Hier, S. Ilyas Munzir, Anne Stahlfeld, Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi, Michael D. Carrithers","High-throughput phenotyping automates the mapping of patient signs to standardized ontology concepts and is essential for precision medicine. This study evaluates the automation of phenotyping of clinical summaries from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database using large language models. Due to their rich phenotype data, these summaries can be surrogates for physician notes. We conduct a performance comparison of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our results indicate that GPT-4 surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo in identifying, categorizing, and normalizing signs, achieving concordance with manual annotators comparable to inter-rater agreement. Despite some limitations in sign normalization, the extensive pre-training of GPT-4 results in high performance and generalizability across several phenotyping tasks while obviating the need for manually annotated training data.

"Misinforming LLMs: vulnerabilities, challenges and opportunities","Bo Zhou, Daniel Geißler, Paul Lukowicz","Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in natural language processing, but their underlying mechanisms are often misunderstood. Despite exhibiting coherent answers and apparent reasoning behaviors, LLMs rely on statistical patterns in word embeddings rather than true cognitive processes. This leads to vulnerabilities such as ""hallucination"" and misinformation. The paper argues that current LLM architectures are inherently untrustworthy due to their reliance on correlations of sequential patterns of word embedding vectors. However, ongoing research into combining generative transformer-based models with fact bases and logic programming languages may lead to the development of trustworthy LLMs capable of generating statements based on given truth and explaining their self-reasoning process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01168v1,2024-08
DERA: Dense Entity Retrieval for Entity Alignment in Knowledge Graphs,"Zhichun Wang, Xuan Chen","Entity Alignment (EA) aims to match equivalent entities in different Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which is essential for knowledge fusion and integration. Recently, embedding-based EA has attracted significant attention and many approaches have been proposed. Early approaches primarily focus on learning entity embeddings from the structural features of KGs, defined by relation triples. Later methods incorporated entities' names and attributes as auxiliary information to enhance embeddings for EA. However, these approaches often used different techniques to encode structural and attribute information, limiting their interaction and mutual enhancement. In this work, we propose a dense entity retrieval framework for EA, leveraging language models to uniformly encode various features of entities and facilitate nearest entity search across KGs. Alignment candidates are first generated through entity retrieval, which are subsequently reranked to determine the final alignments. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both cross-lingual and monolingual EA datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing EA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01154v1,2024-08

Existing evaluations mainly focus on fragmented constraints or narrow scenarios, but they overlook the comprehensiveness and authenticity of constraints from the user's perspective. To bridge this gap, we propose CFBench, a large-scale Comprehensive Constraints Following Benchmark for LLMs, featuring 1,000 curated samples that cover more than 200 real-life scenarios and over 50 NLP tasks. CFBench meticulously compiles constraints from real-world instructions and constructs an innovative systematic framework for constraint types, which includes 10 primary categories and over 25 subcategories, and ensures each constraint is seamlessly integrated within the instructions. To make certain that the evaluation of LLM outputs aligns with user perceptions, we propose an advanced methodology that integrates multi-dimensional assessment criteria with requirement prioritization, covering various perspectives of constraints, instructions, and requirement fulfillment.

Task Prompt Vectors: Effective Initialization through Multi-Task Soft-Prompt Transfer,"Robert Belanec, Simon Ostermann, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova","Prompt tuning is an efficient solution for training large language models (LLMs). However, current soft-prompt-based methods often sacrifice multi-task modularity, requiring the training process to be fully or partially repeated for each newly added task. While recent work on task vectors applied arithmetic operations on full model weights to achieve the desired multi-task performance, a similar approach for soft-prompts is still missing. To this end, we introduce Task Prompt Vectors, created by element-wise difference between weights of tuned soft-prompts and their random initialization. Experimental results on 12 NLU datasets show that task prompt vectors can be used in low-resource settings to effectively initialize prompt tuning on similar tasks. In addition, we show that task prompt vectors are independent of the random initialization of prompt tuning on 2 different language model architectures. This allows prompt arithmetics with the pre-trained vectors from different tasks. In this way, we provide a competitive alternative to state-of-the-art baselines by arithmetic addition of task prompt vectors from multiple tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01119v2,2024-08

Our approach starts with parsing, indexing, and segmenting an extensive collection of 22 million scientific papers as the basic knowledge, followed by training a specialized embedding model tailored to this domain. Additionally, we enhance the vector retrieval process by incorporating a domain-specific knowledge hierarchy, which aids in modeling the intricate interrelationships among each query and context. For queries requiring the most current information, BioRAG deconstructs the question and employs an iterative retrieval process incorporated with the search engine for step-by-step reasoning.

General-purpose Dataflow Model with Neuromorphic Primitives,"Weihao Zhang, Yu Du, Hongyi Li, Songchen Ma, Rong Zhao","Neuromorphic computing exhibits great potential to provide high-performance benefits in various applications beyond neural networks. However, a general-purpose program execution model that aligns with the features of neuromorphic computing is required to bridge the gap between program versatility and neuromorphic hardware efficiency. The dataflow model offers a potential solution, but it faces high graph complexity and incompatibility with neuromorphic hardware when dealing with control flow programs, which decreases the programmability and performance. Here, we present a dataflow model tailored for neuromorphic hardware, called neuromorphic dataflow, which provides a compact, concise, and neuromorphic-compatible program representation for control logic. The neuromorphic dataflow introduces ""when"" and ""where"" primitives, which restructure the view of control.

Bridging Information Gaps in Dialogues With Grounded Exchanges Using Knowledge Graphs,"Phillip Schneider, Nektarios Machner, Kristiina Jokinen, Florian Matthes","Knowledge models are fundamental to dialogue systems for enabling conversational interactions, which require handling domain-specific knowledge. Ensuring effective communication in information-providing conversations entails aligning user understanding with the knowledge available to the system. However, dialogue systems often face challenges arising from semantic inconsistencies in how information is expressed in natural language compared to how it is represented within the system's internal knowledge. To address this problem, we study the potential of large language models for conversational grounding, a mechanism to bridge information gaps by establishing shared knowledge between dialogue participants. Our approach involves annotating human conversations across five knowledge domains to create a new dialogue corpus called BridgeKG. Through a series of experiments on this dataset, we empirically evaluate the capabilities of large language models in classifying grounding acts and identifying grounded information items within a knowledge graph structure. Our findings offer insights into how these models use in-context learning for conversational grounding tasks and common prediction errors, which we illustrate with examples from challenging dialogues.

Adaptive Contrastive Decoding in Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Handling Noisy Contexts,"Youna Kim, Hyuhng Joon Kim, Cheonbok Park, Choonghyun Park, Hyunsoo Cho, Junyeob Kim, Kang Min Yoo, Sang-goo Lee, Taeuk Kim","When using large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks, such as open-domain question answering, external context can bridge the gap between external knowledge and the LLMs' parametric knowledge. Recent research has been developed to amplify contextual knowledge over the parametric knowledge of LLMs with contrastive decoding approaches. While these approaches could yield truthful responses when relevant context is provided, they are prone to vulnerabilities when faced with noisy contexts. We extend the scope of previous studies to encompass noisy contexts and propose adaptive contrastive decoding (ACD) to leverage contextual influence effectively. ACD demonstrates improvements in open-domain question answering tasks compared to baselines, especially in robustness by remaining undistracted by noisy contexts in retrieval-augmented generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01084v2,2024-08
Leveraging Large Language Models for Mobile App Review Feature Extraction,"Quim Motger, Alessio Miaschi, Felice Dell'Orletta, Xavier Franch, Jordi Marco","Mobile app review analysis presents unique challenges due to the low quality, subjective bias, and noisy content of user-generated documents. Extracting features from these reviews is essential for tasks such as feature prioritization and sentiment analysis, but it remains a challenging task. Meanwhile, encoder-only models based on the Transformer architecture have shown promising results for classification and information extraction tasks for multiple software engineering processes. This study explores the hypothesis that encoder-only large language models can enhance feature extraction from mobile app reviews. By leveraging crowdsourced annotations from an industrial context, we redefine feature extraction as a supervised token classification task. Our approach includes extending the pre-training of these models with a large corpus of user reviews to improve contextual understanding and employing instance selection techniques to optimize model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this method improves the precision and recall of extracted features and enhances performance efficiency.

The Impact of Hyperparameters on Large Language Model Inference Performance: An Evaluation of vLLM and HuggingFace Pipelines,Matias Martinez,"The recent surge of open-source large language models (LLMs) enables developers to create AI-based solutions while maintaining control over aspects such as privacy and compliance, thereby providing governance and ownership of the model deployment process. To utilize these LLMs, inference engines are needed. These engines load the model's weights onto available resources, such as GPUs, and process queries to generate responses. The speed of inference, or performance, of the LLM, is critical for real-time applications, as it computes millions or billions of floating point operations per inference. Recently, advanced inference engines such as vLLM have emerged, incorporating novel mechanisms such as efficient memory management to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we analyze the performance, particularly the throughput (tokens generated per unit of time), of 20 LLMs using two inference libraries: vLLM and HuggingFace's pipelines. We investigate how various hyperparameters, which developers must configure, influence inference performance. Our results reveal that throughput landscapes are irregular, with distinct peaks, highlighting the importance of hyperparameter optimization to achieve maximum performance. We also show that applying hyperparameter optimization when upgrading or downgrading the GPU model used for inference can improve throughput from HuggingFace pipelines by an average of 9.16% and 13.7%, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01050v1,2024-08
QUDSELECT: Selective Decoding for Questions Under Discussion Parsing,"Ashima Suvarna, Xiao Liu, Tanmay Parekh, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng","Question Under Discussion (QUD) is a discourse framework that uses implicit questions to reveal discourse relationships between sentences. In QUD parsing, each sentence is viewed as an answer to a question triggered by an anchor sentence in prior context. The resulting QUD structure is required to conform to several theoretical criteria like answer compatibility (how well the question is answered), making QUD parsing a challenging task. Previous works construct QUD parsers in a pipelined manner (i.e. detect the trigger sentence in context and then generate the question). However, these parsers lack a holistic view of the task and can hardly satisfy all the criteria. In this work, we introduce QUDSELECT, a joint-training framework that selectively decodes the QUD dependency structures considering the QUD criteria. Using instruction-tuning, we train models to simultaneously predict the anchor sentence and generate the associated question. To explicitly incorporate the criteria, we adopt a selective decoding strategy of sampling multiple QUD candidates during inference, followed by selecting the best one with criteria scorers. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models by 9% in human evaluation and 4% in automatic evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01046v1,2024-08
UNER: A Unified Prediction Head for Named Entity Recognition in Visually-rich Documents,"Yi Tu, Chong Zhang, Ya Guo, Huan Chen, Jinyang Tang, Huijia Zhu, Qi Zhang","The recognition of named entities in visually-rich documents (VrD-NER) plays a critical role in various real-world scenarios and applications. However, the research in VrD-NER faces three major challenges: complex document layouts, incorrect reading orders, and unsuitable task formulations. To address these challenges, we propose a query-aware entity extraction head, namely UNER, to collaborate with existing multi-modal document transformers to develop more robust VrD-NER models. The UNER head considers the VrD-NER task as a combination of sequence labeling and reading order prediction, effectively addressing the issues of discontinuous entities in documents. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UNER in improving entity extraction performance. Moreover, the UNER head enables a supervised pre-training stage on various VrD-NER datasets to enhance the document transformer backbones and exhibits substantial knowledge transfer from the pre-training stage to the fine-tuning stage. By incorporating universal layout understanding, a pre-trained UNER-based model demonstrates significant advantages in few-shot and cross-linguistic scenarios and exhibits zero-shot entity extraction abilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01038v2,2024-08
Enhancing Financial Market Predictions: Causality-Driven Feature Selection,"Wenhao Liang, Zhengyang Li, Weitong Chen","This paper introduces the FinSen dataset that revolutionizes financial market analysis by integrating economic and financial news articles from 197 countries with stock market data. The dataset's extensive coverage spans 15 years from 2007 to 2023 with temporal information, offering a rich, global perspective with 160,000 records on financial market news. Our study leverages causally validated sentiment scores and LSTM models to enhance market forecast accuracy and reliability. Utilizing the FinSen dataset, we introduce an innovative Focal Calibration Loss, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to 3.34 percent with the DAN 3 model. This not only improves prediction accuracy but also aligns probabilistic forecasts closely with real outcomes, crucial for the financial sector where predicted probability is paramount. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining sentiment analysis with precise calibration techniques for trustworthy financial forecasting where the cost of misinterpretation can be high.

ArchCode: Incorporating Software Requirements in Code Generation with Large Language Models,"Hojae Han, Jaejin Kim, Jaeseok Yoo, Youngwon Lee, Seung-won Hwang","This paper aims to extend the code generation capability of large language models (LLMs) to automatically manage comprehensive software requirements from given textual descriptions. Such requirements include both functional (i.e. achieving expected behavior for inputs) and non-functional (e.g., time/space performance, robustness, maintainability) requirements. However, textual descriptions can either express requirements verbosely or may even omit some of them. We introduce ARCHCODE, a novel framework that leverages in-context learning to organize requirements observed in descriptions and to extrapolate unexpressed requirements from them. ARCHCODE generates requirements from given descriptions, conditioning them to produce code snippets and test cases. Each test case is tailored to one of the requirements, allowing for the ranking of code snippets based on the compliance of their execution results with the requirements. Public benchmarks show that ARCHCODE enhances to satisfy functional requirements, significantly improving Pass@k scores. Furthermore, we introduce HumanEval-NFR, the first evaluation of LLMs' non-functional requirements in code generation, demonstrating ARCHCODE's superiority over baseline methods. The implementation of ARCHCODE and the HumanEval-NFR benchmark are both publicly accessible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00994v1,2024-08
Fairness in Large Language Models in Three Hours,"Thang Doan Viet, Zichong Wang, Minh Nhat Nguyen, Wenbin Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains but often lack fairness considerations, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes against marginalized populations. Unlike fairness in traditional machine learning, fairness in LLMs involves unique backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfillment techniques. This tutorial provides a systematic overview of recent advances in the literature concerning fair LLMs, beginning with real-world case studies to introduce LLMs, followed by an analysis of bias causes therein. The concept of fairness in LLMs is then explored, summarizing the strategies for evaluating bias and the algorithms designed to promote fairness. Additionally, resources for assessing bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are compiled, and current research challenges and open questions in the field are discussed.

Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition via Graph Matching,"Junhao Zheng, Haibin Chen, Qianli Ma","Cross-domain NER is a practical yet challenging problem since the data scarcity in the real-world scenario. A common practice is first to learn a NER model in a rich-resource general domain and then adapt the model to specific domains. Due to the mismatch problem between entity types across domains, the wide knowledge in the general domain can not effectively transfer to the target domain NER model. To this end, we model the label relationship as a probability distribution and construct label graphs in both source and target label spaces. To enhance the contextual representation with label structures, we fuse the label graph into the word embedding output by BERT. By representing label relationships as graphs, we formulate cross-domain NER as a graph matching problem. Furthermore, the proposed method has good applicability with pre-training methods and is potentially capable of other cross-domain prediction tasks. Empirical results on four datasets show that our method outperforms a series of transfer learning, multi-task learning, and few-shot learning methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00981v2,2024-08

To address this, we introduce PERSOMA, Personalized Soft Prompt Adapter architecture. Unlike previous personalized prompting methods for large language models, PERSOMA offers a novel approach to efficiently capture user history. It achieves this by resampling and compressing interactions as free form text into expressive soft prompt embeddings, building upon recent research utilizing embedding representations as input for LLMs. We rigorously validate our approach by evaluating various adapter architectures, first-stage sampling strategies, parameter-efficient tuning techniques like LoRA, and other personalization methods. Our results demonstrate PERSOMA's superior ability to handle large and complex user histories compared to existing embedding-based and text-prompt-based techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00960v1,2024-08
Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Traffic Management at Urban Intersections: The Case of Mixed Traffic Scenarios,"Sari Masri, Huthaifa I. Ashqar, Mohammed Elhenawy","Urban traffic management faces significant challenges due to the dynamic environments, and traditional algorithms fail to quickly adapt to this environment in real-time and predict possible conflicts. This study explores the ability of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically, GPT-4o-mini to improve traffic management at urban intersections. We recruited GPT-4o-mini to analyze, predict position, detect and resolve the conflicts at an intersection in real-time for various basic scenarios. The key findings of this study to investigate whether LLMs can logically reason and understand the scenarios to enhance the traffic efficiency and safety by providing real-time analysis. The study highlights the potential of LLMs in urban traffic management creating more intelligent and more adaptive systems. Results showed the GPT-4o-mini was effectively able to detect and resolve conflicts in heavy traffic, congestion, and mixed-speed conditions. The complex scenario of multiple intersections with obstacles and pedestrians saw successful conflict management as well. Results show that the integration of LLMs promises to improve the effectiveness of traffic control for safer and more efficient urban intersection management.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00948v1,2024-08
Towards Zero-Shot Annotation of the Built Environment with Vision-Language Models (Vision Paper),"Bin Han, Yiwei Yang, Anat Caspi, Bill Howe","Equitable urban transportation applications require high-fidelity digital representations of the built environment: not just streets and sidewalks, but bike lanes, marked and unmarked crossings, curb ramps and cuts, obstructions, traffic signals, signage, street markings, potholes, and more. Direct inspections and manual annotations are prohibitively expensive at scale. Conventional machine learning methods require substantial annotated training data for adequate performance. In this paper, we consider vision language models as a mechanism for annotating diverse urban features from satellite images, reducing the dependence on human annotation to produce large training sets. While these models have achieved impressive results in describing common objects in images captured from a human perspective, their training sets are less likely to include strong signals for esoteric features in the built environment, and their performance in these settings is therefore unclear. We demonstrate proof-of-concept combining a state-of-the-art vision language model and variants of a prompting strategy that asks the model to consider segmented elements independently of the original image. Experiments on two urban features -- stop lines and raised tables -- show that while direct zero-shot prompting correctly annotates nearly zero images, the pre-segmentation strategies can annotate images with near 40% intersection-over-union accuracy. We describe how these results inform a new research agenda in automatic annotation of the built environment to improve equity, accessibility, and safety at broad scale and in diverse environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00932v1,2024-08
Automatic Pull Request Description Generation Using LLMs: A T5 Model Approach,"Md Nazmus Sakib, Md Athikul Islam, Md Mashrur Arifin","Developers create pull request (PR) descriptions to provide an overview of their changes and explain the motivations behind them. These descriptions help reviewers and fellow developers quickly understand the updates. Despite their importance, some developers omit these descriptions. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated method for generating PR descriptions based on commit messages and source code comments. This method frames the task as a text summarization problem, for which we utilized the T5 text-to-text transfer model. We fine-tuned a pre-trained T5 model using a dataset containing 33,466 PRs. The model's effectiveness was assessed using ROUGE metrics, which are recognized for their strong alignment with human evaluations. Our findings reveal that the T5 model significantly outperforms LexRank, which served as our baseline for comparison.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00921v1,2024-08

Granting GPT-4 License and Opportunity: Enhancing Accuracy and Confidence Estimation for Few-Shot Event Detection,"Steven Fincke, Adrien Bibal, Elizabeth Boschee","Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have shown enough promise in the few-shot learning context to suggest use in the generation of ""silver"" data and refinement of new ontologies through iterative application and review. Such workflows become more effective with reliable confidence estimation. Unfortunately, confidence estimation is a documented weakness of models such as GPT-4, and established methods to compensate require significant additional complexity and computation. The present effort explores methods for effective confidence estimation with GPT-4 with few-shot learning for event detection in the BETTER ontology as a vehicle. The key innovation is expanding the prompt and task presented to GPT-4 to provide License to speculate when unsure and Opportunity to quantify and explain its uncertainty (L&O).

Hybrid Querying Over Relational Databases and Large Language Models,"Fuheng Zhao, Divyakant Agrawal, Amr El Abbadi","Database queries traditionally operate under the closed-world assumption, providing no answers to questions that require information beyond the data stored in the database. Hybrid querying using SQL offers an alternative by integrating relational databases with large language models (LLMs) to answer beyond-database questions. In this paper, we present the first cross-domain benchmark, SWAN, containing 120 beyond-database questions over four real-world databases. To leverage state-of-the-art language models in addressing these complex questions in SWAN, we present two solutions: one based on schema expansion and the other based on user defined functions. We also discuss optimization opportunities and potential future directions. Our evaluation demonstrates that using GPT-4 Turbo with few-shot prompts, one can achieves up to 40.0\% in execution accuracy and 48.2\% in data factuality. These results highlights both the potential and challenges for hybrid querying. We believe that our work will inspire further research in creating more efficient and accurate data systems that seamlessly integrate relational databases and large language models to address beyond-database questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00884v2,2024-08
UniMoT: Unified Molecule-Text Language Model with Discrete Token Representation,"Juzheng Zhang, Yatao Bian, Yongqiang Chen, Quanming Yao","The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks has driven the research community to extend their capabilities to molecular applications. However, most molecular LLMs employ adapter-based architectures that do not treat molecule and text modalities equally and lack a supervision signal for the molecule modality. To address these issues, we introduce UniMoT, a Unified Molecule-Text LLM adopting a tokenizer-based architecture that expands the vocabulary of LLM with molecule tokens. Specifically, we introduce a Vector Quantization-driven tokenizer that incorporates a Q-Former to bridge the modality gap between molecule and text. This tokenizer transforms molecules into sequences of molecule tokens with causal dependency, encapsulating high-level molecular and textual information. Equipped with this tokenizer, UniMoT can unify molecule and text modalities under a shared token representation and an autoregressive training paradigm, enabling it to interpret molecules as a foreign language and generate them as text. Following a four-stage training scheme, UniMoT emerges as a multi-modal generalist capable of performing both molecule-to-text and text-to-molecule tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMoT achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of molecule comprehension and generation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00863v1,2024-08
MM-Vet v2: A Challenging Benchmark to Evaluate Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities,"Weihao Yu, Zhengyuan Yang, Lingfeng Ren, Linjie Li, Jianfeng Wang, Kevin Lin, Chung-Ching Lin, Zicheng Liu, Lijuan Wang, Xinchao Wang","MM-Vet, with open-ended vision-language questions targeting at evaluating integrated capabilities, has become one of the most popular benchmarks for large multimodal model evaluation. MM-Vet assesses six core vision-language (VL) capabilities: recognition, knowledge, spatial awareness, language generation, OCR, and math. However, its question format is restricted to single image-text pairs, lacking the interleaved image and text sequences prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce MM-Vet v2, which includes a new VL capability called ""image-text sequence understanding"", evaluating models' ability to process VL sequences. Furthermore, we maintain the high quality of evaluation samples while further expanding the evaluation set size. Using MM-Vet v2 to benchmark large multimodal models, we found that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the best model with a score of 71.8, slightly outperforming GPT-4o which scored 71.0.

AgentGen: Enhancing Planning Abilities for Large Language Model based Agent via Environment and Task Generation,"Mengkang Hu, Pu Zhao, Can Xu, Qingfeng Sun, Jianguang Lou, Qingwei Lin, Ping Luo, Saravan Rajmohan","Large Language Model-based agents have garnered significant attention and are becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, planning ability is a crucial component of an LLM-based agent, which generally entails achieving a desired goal from an initial state. This paper investigates enhancing the planning abilities of LLMs through instruction tuning, referred to as agent training. Recent studies have demonstrated that utilizing expert-level trajectory for instruction-tuning LLMs effectively enhances their planning capabilities. However, existing work primarily focuses on synthesizing trajectories from manually designed planning tasks and environments. The labor-intensive nature of creating these environments and tasks impedes the generation of sufficiently varied and extensive trajectories. To address this limitation, this paper explores the automated synthesis of diverse environments and a gradual range of planning tasks, from easy to difficult. We introduce a framework, AgentGen, that leverages LLMs first to generate environments and subsequently generate planning tasks conditioned on these environments. Specifically, to improve environmental diversity, we propose using an inspiration corpus composed of various domain-specific text segments as the context for synthesizing environments. Moreover, to increase the difficulty diversity of generated planning tasks, we propose a bidirectional evolution method, Bi-Evol, that evolves planning tasks from easier and harder directions to synthesize a task set with a smoother difficulty curve. The evaluation results derived from AgentBoard show that AgentGen greatly improves LLMs' planning ability, e.g., the AgentGen instruction-tuned Llama-3.1-8B surpasses GPT-3.5 in overall performance. Moreover, the AgentGen-tuned Llama-3.1-70B model achieves state-of-the-art results in planning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00764v2,2024-08
Tamper-Resistant Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs,"Rishub Tamirisa, Bhrugu Bharathi, Long Phan, Andy Zhou, Alice Gatti, Tarun Suresh, Maxwell Lin, Justin Wang, Rowan Wang, Ron Arel, Andy Zou, Dawn Song, Bo Li, Dan Hendrycks, Mantas Mazeika","Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00761v3,2024-08
CERT-ED: Certifiably Robust Text Classification for Edit Distance,"Zhuoqun Huang, Neil G Marchant, Olga Ohrimenko, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein","With the growing integration of AI in daily life, ensuring the robustness of systems to inference-time attacks is crucial. Among the approaches for certifying robustness to such adversarial examples, randomized smoothing has emerged as highly promising due to its nature as a wrapper around arbitrary black-box models. Previous work on randomized smoothing in natural language processing has primarily focused on specific subsets of edit distance operations, such as synonym substitution or word insertion, without exploring the certification of all edit operations. In this paper, we adapt Randomized Deletion (Huang et al., 2023) and propose, CERTified Edit Distance defense (CERT-ED) for natural language classification. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that CERT-ED outperforms the existing Hamming distance method RanMASK (Zeng et al., 2023) in 4 out of 5 datasets in terms of both accuracy and the cardinality of the certificate. By covering various threat models, including 5 direct and 5 transfer attacks, our method improves empirical robustness in 38 out of 50 settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00728v1,2024-08
Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Medicine with Iterative Follow-up Questions,"Guangzhi Xiong, Qiao Jin, Xiao Wang, Minjia Zhang, Zhiyong Lu, Aidong Zhang","The emergent abilities of large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in solving medical questions. They can possess considerable medical knowledge, but may still hallucinate and are inflexible in the knowledge updates. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to enhance the medical question-answering capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge bases, it may still fail in complex cases where multiple rounds of information-seeking are required. To address such an issue, we propose iterative RAG for medicine (i-MedRAG), where LLMs can iteratively ask follow-up queries based on previous information-seeking attempts. In each iteration of i-MedRAG, the follow-up queries will be answered by a conventional RAG system and they will be further used to guide the query generation in the next iteration. Our experiments show the improved performance of various LLMs brought by i-MedRAG compared with conventional RAG on complex questions from clinical vignettes in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), as well as various knowledge tests in the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset. Notably, our zero-shot i-MedRAG outperforms all existing prompt engineering and fine-tuning methods on GPT-3.5, achieving an accuracy of 69.68% on the MedQA dataset. In addition, we characterize the scaling properties of i-MedRAG with different iterations of follow-up queries and different numbers of queries per iteration. Our case studies show that i-MedRAG can flexibly ask follow-up queries to form reasoning chains, providing an in-depth analysis of medical questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-of-its-kind study on incorporating follow-up queries into medical RAG. The implementation of i-MedRAG is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/MedRAG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00727v3,2024-08
Improving Text Embeddings for Smaller Language Models Using Contrastive Fine-tuning,"Trapoom Ukarapol, Zhicheng Lee, Amy Xin","While Large Language Models show remarkable performance in natural language understanding, their resource-intensive nature makes them less accessible. In contrast, smaller language models such as MiniCPM offer more sustainable scalability, but often underperform without specialized optimization. In this paper, we explore the enhancement of smaller language models through the improvement of their text embeddings. We select three language models, MiniCPM, Phi-2, and Gemma, to conduct contrastive fine-tuning on the NLI dataset. Our results demonstrate that this fine-tuning method enhances the quality of text embeddings for all three models across various benchmarks, with MiniCPM showing the most significant improvements of an average 56.33% performance gain.

Assessing the Variety of a Concept Space Using an Unbiased Estimate of Rao's Quadratic Index,"Anubhab Majumder, Ujjwal Pal, Amaresh Chakrabarti","Past research relates design creativity to 'divergent thinking,' i.e., how well the concept space is explored during the early phase of design. Researchers have argued that generating several concepts would increase the chances of producing better design solutions. 'Variety' is one of the parameters by which one can quantify the breadth of a concept space explored by the designers. It is useful to assess variety at the conceptual design stage because, at this stage, designers have the freedom to explore different solution principles so as to satisfy a design problem with substantially novel concepts. This article elaborates on and critically examines the existing variety metrics from the engineering design literature, discussing their limitations. A new distance-based variety metric is proposed, along with a prescriptive framework to support the assessment process. This framework uses the SAPPhIRE model of causality as a knowledge representation scheme to measure the real-valued distance between two design concepts. The proposed framework is implemented in a software tool called 'VariAnT.' Furthermore, the tool's application is demonstrated through an illustrative example.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00684v1,2024-08
Leveraging Entailment Judgements in Cross-Lingual Summarisation,"Huajian Zhang, Laura Perez-Beltrachini","Synthetically created Cross-Lingual Summarisation (CLS) datasets are prone to include document-summary pairs where the reference summary is unfaithful to the corresponding document as it contains content not supported by the document (i.e., hallucinated content). This low data quality misleads model learning and obscures evaluation results. Automatic ways to assess hallucinations and improve training have been proposed for monolingual summarisation, predominantly in English. For CLS, we propose to use off-the-shelf cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (X-NLI) to evaluate faithfulness of reference and model generated summaries. Then, we study training approaches that are aware of faithfulness issues in the training data and propose an approach that uses unlikelihood loss to teach a model about unfaithful summary sequences. Our results show that it is possible to train CLS models that yield more faithful summaries while maintaining comparable or better informativess.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00675v1,2024-08
Aligning Multiple Knowledge Graphs in a Single Pass,"Yaming Yang, Zhe Wang, Ziyu Guan, Wei Zhao, Weigang Lu, Xinyan Huang","Entity alignment (EA) is to identify equivalent entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs), which can help fuse these KGs into a more comprehensive one. Previous EA methods mainly focus on aligning a pair of KGs, and to the best of our knowledge, no existing EA method considers aligning multiple (more than two) KGs. To fill this research gap, in this work, we study a novel problem of aligning multiple KGs and propose an effective framework named MultiEA to solve the problem. First, we embed the entities of all the candidate KGs into a common feature space by a shared KG encoder. Then, we explore three alignment strategies to minimize the distances among pre-aligned entities. In particular, we propose an innovative inference enhancement technique to improve the alignment performance by incorporating high-order similarities. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of MultiEA, we construct two new real-world benchmark datasets and conduct extensive experiments on them. The results show that our MultiEA can effectively and efficiently align multiple KGs in a single pass.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00662v1,2024-08
"SentenceVAE: Enable Next-sentence Prediction for Large Language Models with Faster Speed, Higher Accuracy and Longer Context","Hongjun An, Yifan Chen, Zhe Sun, Xuelong Li","Current large language models (LLMs) primarily utilize next-token prediction method for inference, which significantly impedes their processing speed. In this paper, we introduce a novel inference methodology termed next-sentence prediction, aiming at enhancing the inference efficiency of LLMs. We present Sentence Variational Autoencoder (SentenceVAE), which includes a Sentence Encoder to compress multiple tokens in a sentence into a single token, and a Sentence Decoder to reconstruct it. By integrating SentenceVAE into the input and output layers of LLMs, we develop Sentence-level LLMs (SLLMs) that employ a sentence-by-sentence inference method. In addition, the SentenceVAE module of SLLMs can maintain the integrity of the original semantic content by segmenting the context into sentences, thereby improving accuracy while boosting inference speed. Moreover, compared to previous LLMs, SLLMs process fewer tokens over equivalent context length, significantly reducing memory demands for self-attention computation and facilitating the handling of longer context. Extensive experiments on Wanjuan dataset have revealed that the proposed method can accelerate inference speed by 204~365%, reduce perplexity (PPL) to 46~75% of its original metric, and decrease memory overhead by 86~91% for the equivalent context length, compared to previous token-by-token methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00655v5,2024-08
SynesLM: A Unified Approach for Audio-visual Speech Recognition and Translation via Language Model and Synthetic Data,"Yichen Lu, Jiaqi Song, Xuankai Chang, Hengwei Bian, Soumi Maiti, Shinji Watanabe","In this work, we present SynesLM, an unified model which can perform three multimodal language understanding tasks: audio-visual automatic speech recognition(AV-ASR) and visual-aided speech/machine translation(VST/VMT). Unlike previous research that focused on lip motion as visual cues for speech signals, our work explores more general visual information within entire frames, such as objects and actions. Additionally, we use synthetic image data to enhance the correlation between image and speech data. We benchmark SynesLM against the How2 dataset, demonstrating performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models dedicated to AV-ASR while maintaining our multitasking framework. Remarkably, for zero-shot AV-ASR, SynesLM achieved SOTA performance by lowering the Word Error Rate (WER) from 43.4% to 39.4% on the VisSpeech Dataset. Furthermore, our results in VST and VMT outperform the previous results, improving the BLEU score to 43.5 from 37.2 for VST, and to 54.8 from 54.4 for VMT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00624v1,2024-08
Are Bigger Encoders Always Better in Vision Large Models?,"Bozhou Li, Hao Liang, Zimo Meng, Wentao Zhang","In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential in real-world applications. They are developing rapidly due to their remarkable ability to comprehend multimodal information and their inherent powerful cognitive and reasoning capabilities. Among MLLMs, vision language models (VLM) stand out for their ability to understand vision information. However, the scaling trend of VLMs under the current mainstream paradigm has not been extensively studied. Whether we can achieve better performance by training even larger models is still unclear. To address this issue, we conducted experiments on the pretraining stage of MLLMs. We conduct our experiment using different encoder sizes and large language model (LLM) sizes. Our findings indicate that merely increasing the size of encoders does not necessarily enhance the performance of VLMs. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of LLM backbone parameter size and data quality on the pretraining outcomes. Additionally, we explored the differences in scaling laws between LLMs and VLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00620v1,2024-08
Downstream bias mitigation is all you need,"Arkadeep Baksi, Rahul Singh, Tarun Joshi","The advent of transformer-based architectures and large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models. Since these LLMs are trained on huge corpuses of data from the web and other sources, there has been a major concern about harmful prejudices that may potentially be transferred from the data. In many applications, these pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on task specific datasets, which can further contribute to biases. This paper studies the extent of biases absorbed by LLMs during pre-training as well as task-specific behaviour after fine-tuning. We found that controlled interventions on pre-trained LLMs, prior to fine-tuning, have minimal effect on lowering biases in classifiers. However, the biases present in domain-specific datasets play a much bigger role, and hence mitigating them at this stage has a bigger impact. While pre-training does matter, but after the model has been pre-trained, even slight changes to co-occurrence rates in the fine-tuning dataset has a significant effect on the bias of the model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00612v2,2024-08

In this work, we introduce a large collection of verbalized rebuses for the Italian language and use it to assess the rebus-solving capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models. While general-purpose systems such as LLaMA-3 and GPT-4o perform poorly on this task, ad-hoc fine-tuning seems to improve models' performance. However, we find that performance gains from training are largely motivated by memorization.

Alleviating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Active Retrieval Augmentation,"Xiaoye Qu, Qiyuan Chen, Wei Wei, Jishuo Sun, Jianfeng Dong","Despite the remarkable ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in image comprehension, these models frequently generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination.Recently, in large language models (LLMs), augmenting LLMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources has been proven as a promising solution to mitigate hallucinations.However, the retrieval augmentation in LVLM significantly lags behind the widespread applications of LVLM. Moreover, when transferred to augmenting LVLMs, sometimes the hallucination degree of the model is even exacerbated.Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we introduce a novel framework, the Active Retrieval-Augmented large vision-language model (ARA), specifically designed to address hallucinations by incorporating three critical dimensions: (i) dissecting the retrieval targets based on the inherent hierarchical structures of images. (ii) pinpointing the most effective retrieval methods and filtering out the reliable retrieval results. (iii) timing the retrieval process to coincide with episodes of low certainty, while circumventing unnecessary retrieval during periods of high certainty. To assess the capability of our proposed ARA model in reducing hallucination, we employ three widely used LVLM models (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, and mPLUG-Owl2) across four benchmarks. Our empirical observations suggest that by utilizing fitting retrieval mechanisms and timing the retrieval judiciously, we can effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. We hope that this study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the retrieval augmentation to LVLMs for reducing hallucinations with more effective retrieval and minimal retrieval occurrences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00555v1,2024-08
Mitigating Multilingual Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models,"Xiaoye Qu, Mingyang Song, Wei Wei, Jianfeng Dong, Yu Cheng","While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they suffer from hallucination problems, where models generate plausible yet incorrect answers given the input image-query pair. This hallucination phenomenon is even more severe when querying the image in non-English languages, while existing methods for mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs only consider the English scenarios. In this paper, we make the first attempt to mitigate this important multilingual hallucination in LVLMs. With thorough experiment analysis, we found that multilingual hallucination in LVLMs is a systemic problem that could arise from deficiencies in multilingual capabilities or inadequate multimodal abilities. To this end, we propose a two-stage Multilingual Hallucination Removal (MHR) framework for LVLMs, aiming to improve resistance to hallucination for both high-resource and low-resource languages. Instead of relying on the intricate manual annotations of multilingual resources, we fully leverage the inherent capabilities of the LVLM and propose a novel cross-lingual alignment method, which generates multiple responses for each image-query input and then identifies the hallucination-aware pairs for each language. These data pairs are finally used for direct preference optimization to prompt the LVLMs to favor non-hallucinating responses. Experimental results show that our MHR achieves a substantial reduction in hallucination generation for LVLMs. Notably, on our extended multilingual POPE benchmark, our framework delivers an average increase of 19.0% in accuracy across 13 different languages.

Intermittent Semi-working Mask: A New Masking Paradigm for LLMs,"Mingcong Lu, Jiangcai Zhu, Wang Hao, Zheng Li, Shusheng Zhang, Kailai Shao, Chao Chen, Nan Li, Feng Wang, Xin Lu","Multi-turn dialogues are a key interaction method between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs), as conversations extend over multiple rounds, keeping LLMs' high generation quality and low latency is a challenge. Mainstream LLMs can be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and prefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform causal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as multi-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional attention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent inefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the attention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we propose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to address these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and unidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In this way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low generation latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments illustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00539v1,2024-08
The Monetisation of Toxicity: Analysing YouTube Content Creators and Controversy-Driven Engagement,"Thales Bertaglia, Catalina Goanta, Adriana Iamnitchi","YouTube is a major social media platform that plays a significant role in digital culture, with content creators at its core. These creators often engage in controversial behaviour to drive engagement, which can foster toxicity. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of controversial content on YouTube, focusing on the relationship between controversy, toxicity, and monetisation. We introduce a curated dataset comprising 20 controversial YouTube channels extracted from Reddit discussions, including 16,349 videos and more than 105 million comments. We identify and categorise monetisation cues from video descriptions into various models, including affiliate marketing and direct selling, using lists of URLs and keywords. Additionally, we train a machine learning model to measure the toxicity of comments in these videos. Our findings reveal that while toxic comments correlate with higher engagement, they negatively impact monetisation, indicating that controversy-driven interaction does not necessarily lead to financial gain. We also observed significant variation in monetisation strategies, with some creators showing extensive monetisation despite high toxicity levels. Our study introduces a curated dataset, lists of URLs and keywords to categorise monetisation, a machine learning model to measure toxicity, and is a significant step towards understanding the complex relationship between controversy, engagement, and monetisation on YouTube. The lists used for detecting and categorising monetisation cues are available on https://github.com/thalesbertaglia/toxmon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00534v1,2024-08
GalleryGPT: Analyzing Paintings with Large Multimodal Models,"Yi Bin, Wenhao Shi, Yujuan Ding, Zhiqiang Hu, Zheng Wang, Yang Yang, See-Kiong Ng, Heng Tao Shen","Artwork analysis is important and fundamental skill for art appreciation, which could enrich personal aesthetic sensibility and facilitate the critical thinking ability. Understanding artworks is challenging due to its subjective nature, diverse interpretations, and complex visual elements, requiring expertise in art history, cultural background, and aesthetic theory. However, limited by the data collection and model ability, previous works for automatically analyzing artworks mainly focus on classification, retrieval, and other simple tasks, which is far from the goal of AI. To facilitate the research progress, in this paper, we step further to compose comprehensive analysis inspired by the remarkable perception and generation ability of large multimodal models. Specifically, we first propose a task of composing paragraph analysis for artworks, i.e., painting in this paper, only focusing on visual characteristics to formulate more comprehensive understanding of artworks. To support the research on formal analysis, we collect a large dataset PaintingForm, with about 19k painting images and 50k analysis paragraphs. We further introduce a superior large multimodal model for painting analysis composing, dubbed GalleryGPT, which is slightly modified and fine-tuned based on LLaVA architecture leveraging our collected data. We conduct formal analysis generation and zero-shot experiments across several datasets to assess the capacity of our model. The results show remarkable performance improvements comparing with powerful baseline LMMs, demonstrating its superb ability of art analysis and generalization. \textcolor{blue}{The codes and model are available at: https://github.com/steven640pixel/GalleryGPT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00491v1,2024-08
In-Context Example Selection via Similarity Search Improves Low-Resource Machine Translation,"Armel Zebaze, Benoît Sagot, Rachel Bawden","The ability of generative large language models (LLMs) to perform in-context learning has given rise to a large body of research into how best to prompt models for various natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we focus on machine translation (MT), a task that has been shown to benefit from in-context translation examples. However no systematic studies have been published on how best to select examples, and mixed results have been reported on the usefulness of similarity-based selection over random selection. We provide a study covering multiple LLMs and multiple in-context example retrieval strategies, comparing multilingual sentence embeddings. We cover several language directions, representing different levels of language resourcedness (English into French, German, Swahili and Wolof). Contrarily to previously published results, we find that sentence embedding similarity can improve MT, especially for low-resource language directions, and discuss the balance between selection pool diversity and quality. We also highlight potential problems with the evaluation of LLM-based MT and suggest a more appropriate evaluation protocol, adapting the COMET metric to the evaluation of LLMs. Code and outputs are freely available at https://github.com/ArmelRandy/ICL-MT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00397v1,2024-08
DeliLaw: A Chinese Legal Counselling System Based on a Large Language Model,"Nan Xie, Yuelin Bai, Hengyuan Gao, Feiteng Fang, Qixuan Zhao, Zhijian Li, Ziqiang Xue, Liang Zhu, Shiwen Ni, Min Yang","Traditional legal retrieval systems designed to retrieve legal documents, statutes, precedents, and other legal information are unable to give satisfactory answers due to lack of semantic understanding of specific questions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in a variety of natural language processing tasks, which inspired us that we train a LLM in the legal domain to help legal retrieval. However, in the Chinese legal domain, due to the complexity of legal questions and the rigour of legal articles, there is no legal large model with satisfactory practical application yet. In this paper, we present DeliLaw, a Chinese legal counselling system based on a large language model. DeliLaw integrates a legal retrieval module and a case retrieval module to overcome the model hallucination. Users can consult professional legal questions, search for legal articles and relevant judgement cases, etc. on the DeliLaw system in a dialogue mode. In addition, DeliLaw supports the use of English for counseling. we provide the address of the system: https://data.delilegal.com/lawQuestion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00357v1,2024-08
ABC Align: Large Language Model Alignment for Safety & Accuracy,"Gareth Seneque, Lap-Hang Ho, Ariel Kuperman, Nafise Erfanian Saeedi, Jeffrey Molendijk","Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an unsolved problem. Human preferences are highly distributed and can be captured at multiple levels of abstraction, from the individual to diverse populations. Organisational preferences, represented by standards and principles, are defined to mitigate reputational risk or meet legislative obligations. In this paper, we present ABC Align, a novel alignment methodology for LLMs that enables integration of the standards and preferences of a large media organisation into the LLM itself. We combine a set of data and methods that build on recent breakthroughs in synthetic data generation, preference optimisation, and post-training model quantisation. Our unified approach mitigates bias and improves accuracy, while preserving reasoning capability, as measured against standard benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00307v1,2024-08
Bailing-TTS: Chinese Dialectal Speech Synthesis Towards Human-like Spontaneous Representation,"Xinhan Di, Zihao Chen, Yunming Liang, Junjie Zheng, Yihua Wang, Chaofan Ding","Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models have made significant progress recently.However, they still fall short in the generation of Chinese dialectal speech. Toaddress this, we propose Bailing-TTS, a family of large-scale TTS models capable of generating high-quality Chinese dialectal speech. Bailing-TTS serves as a foundation model for Chinese dialectal speech generation. First, continual semi-supervised learning is proposed to facilitate the alignment of text tokens and speech tokens. Second, the Chinese dialectal representation learning is developed using a specific transformer architecture and multi-stage training processes. With the proposed design of novel network architecture and corresponding strategy, Bailing-TTS is able to generate Chinese dialectal speech from text effectively and efficiently. Experiments demonstrate that Bailing-TTS generates Chinese dialectal speech towards human-like spontaneous representation.

QUITO: Accelerating Long-Context Reasoning through Query-Guided Context Compression,"Wenshan Wang, Yihang Wang, Yixing Fan, Huaming Liao, Jiafeng Guo","In-context learning (ICL) capabilities are foundational to the success of large language models (LLMs). Recently, context compression has attracted growing interest since it can largely reduce reasoning complexities and computation costs of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel Query-gUIded aTtention cOmpression (QUITO) method, which leverages attention of the question over the contexts to filter useless information. Specifically, we take a trigger token to calculate the attention distribution of the context in response to the question. Based on the distribution, we propose three different filtering methods to satisfy the budget constraints of the context length. We evaluate the QUITO using two widely-used datasets, namely, NaturalQuestions and ASQA. Experimental results demonstrate that QUITO significantly outperforms established baselines across various datasets and downstream LLMs, underscoring its effectiveness.

Clover-2: Accurate Inference for Regressive Lightweight Speculative Decoding,"Bin Xiao, Lujun Gui, Lei Su, Weipeng Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently suffer from inefficiencies, largely attributable to the discord between the requirements of auto-regressive decoding and the architecture of contemporary GPUs. Recently, regressive lightweight speculative decoding has garnered attention for its notable efficiency improvements in text generation tasks. This approach utilizes a lightweight regressive draft model, like a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or a single transformer decoder layer, leveraging sequential information to iteratively predict potential tokens. Specifically, RNN draft models are computationally economical but tend to deliver lower accuracy, while attention decoder layer models exhibit the opposite traits. This paper presents Clover-2, an advanced iteration of Clover, an RNN-based draft model designed to achieve comparable accuracy to that of attention decoder layer models while maintaining minimal computational overhead. Clover-2 enhances the model architecture and incorporates knowledge distillation to increase Clover's accuracy and improve overall efficiency. We conducted experiments using the open-source Vicuna 7B and LLaMA3-Instruct 8B models. The results demonstrate that Clover-2 surpasses existing methods across various model architectures, showcasing its efficacy and robustness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00264v1,2024-08
Enhanced Structured State Space Models via Grouped FIR Filtering and Attention Sink Mechanisms,"Tian Meng, Yang Tao, Wuliang Yin","Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as compelling alternatives to Transformer architectures, offering linear-time complexity and superior performance in various sequence modeling tasks. Despite their advantages, SSMs like the original Mamba-2 face training difficulties due to the sensitivities introduced by the extended series of recurrent matrix multiplications. In this paper, we propose an advanced architecture that mitigates these challenges by decomposing A-multiplications into multiple groups and optimizing positional encoding through Grouped Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering. This new structure, denoted as Grouped FIR-enhanced SSM (GFSSM), employs semiseparable matrices for efficient computation. Furthermore, inspired by the ""attention sink"" phenomenon identified in streaming language models, we incorporate a similar mechanism to enhance the stability and performance of our model over extended sequences. Our approach further bridges the gap between SSMs and Transformer architectures, offering a viable path forward for scalable and high-performing sequence modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00244v1,2024-08
Lost in Translation: Latent Concept Misalignment in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Juntu Zhao, Junyu Deng, Yixin Ye, Chongxuan Li, Zhijie Deng, Dequan Wang","Advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have broadened extensive downstream practical applications, but such models often encounter misalignment issues between text and image. Taking the generation of a combination of two disentangled concepts as an example, say given the prompt ""a tea cup of iced coke"", existing models usually generate a glass cup of iced coke because the iced coke usually co-occurs with the glass cup instead of the tea one during model training. The root of such misalignment is attributed to the confusion in the latent semantic space of text-to-image diffusion models, and hence we refer to the ""a tea cup of iced coke"" phenomenon as Latent Concept Misalignment (LC-Mis). We leverage large language models (LLMs) to thoroughly investigate the scope of LC-Mis, and develop an automated pipeline for aligning the latent semantics of diffusion models to text prompts. Empirical assessments confirm the effectiveness of our approach, substantially reducing LC-Mis errors and enhancing the robustness and versatility of text-to-image diffusion models.

"Sentence-wise Speech Summarization: Task, Datasets, and End-to-End Modeling with LM Knowledge Distillation","Kohei Matsuura, Takanori Ashihara, Takafumi Moriya, Masato Mimura, Takatomo Kano, Atsunori Ogawa, Marc Delcroix","This paper introduces a novel approach called sentence-wise speech summarization (Sen-SSum), which generates text summaries from a spoken document in a sentence-by-sentence manner. Sen-SSum combines the real-time processing of automatic speech recognition (ASR) with the conciseness of speech summarization. To explore this approach, we present two datasets for Sen-SSum: Mega-SSum and CSJ-SSum. Using these datasets, our study evaluates two types of Transformer-based models: 1) cascade models that combine ASR and strong text summarization models, and 2) end-to-end (E2E) models that directly convert speech into a text summary. While E2E models are appealing to develop compute-efficient models, they perform worse than cascade models. Therefore, we propose knowledge distillation for E2E models using pseudo-summaries generated by the cascade models. Our experiments show that this proposed knowledge distillation effectively improves the performance of the E2E model on both datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00205v1,2024-08
OmniParser for Pure Vision Based GUI Agent,"Yadong Lu, Jianwei Yang, Yelong Shen, Ahmed Awadallah","The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in driving the agent system operating on user interfaces. However, we argue that the power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textsc{OmniParser}, a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. We first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. \textsc{OmniParser} significantly improves GPT-4V's performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, \textsc{OmniParser} with screenshot only input outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of screenshot.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00203v1,2024-08
