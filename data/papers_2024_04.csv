What Drives Performance in Multilingual Language Models?,"Sina Bagheri Nezhad, Ameeta Agrawal","This study investigates the factors influencing the performance of multilingual large language models (MLLMs) across diverse languages. We study 6 MLLMs, including masked language models, autoregressive models, and instruction-tuned LLMs, on the SIB-200 dataset, a topic classification dataset encompassing 204 languages. Our analysis considers three scenarios: ALL languages, SEEN languages (present in the model's pretraining data), and UNSEEN languages (not present or documented in the model's pretraining data in any meaningful way). We examine the impact of factors such as pretraining data size, general resource availability, language family, and script type on model performance. Decision tree analysis reveals that pretraining data size is the most influential factor for SEEN languages. However, interestingly, script type and language family are crucial for UNSEEN languages, highlighting the importance of cross-lingual transfer learning. Notably, model size and architecture do not significantly alter the most important features identified. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current MLLMs and hope to guide the development of more effective and equitable multilingual NLP systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19159v1,2024-04
RTF: Region-based Table Filling Method for Relational Triple Extraction,"Ning An, Lei Hei, Yong Jiang, Weiping Meng, Jingjing Hu, Boran Huang, Feiliang Ren","Relational triple extraction is crucial work for the automatic construction of knowledge graphs. Existing methods only construct shallow representations from a token or token pair-level. However, previous works ignore local spatial dependencies of relational triples, resulting in a weakness of entity pair boundary detection. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Region-based Table Filling method (RTF). We devise a novel region-based tagging scheme and bi-directional decoding strategy, which regard each relational triple as a region on the relation-specific table, and identifies triples by determining two endpoints of each region. We also introduce convolution to construct region-level table representations from a spatial perspective which makes triples easier to be captured. In addition, we share partial tagging scores among different relations to improve learning efficiency of relation classifier. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art with better generalization capability on three variants of two widely used benchmark datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19154v2,2024-04
Q-GroundCAM: Quantifying Grounding in Vision Language Models via GradCAM,"Navid Rajabi, Jana Kosecka","Vision and Language Models (VLMs) continue to demonstrate remarkable zero-shot (ZS) performance across various tasks. However, many probing studies have revealed that even the best-performing VLMs struggle to capture aspects of compositional scene understanding, lacking the ability to properly ground and localize linguistic phrases in images. Recent VLM advancements include scaling up both model and dataset sizes, additional training objectives and levels of supervision, and variations in the model architectures. To characterize the grounding ability of VLMs, such as phrase grounding, referring expressions comprehension, and relationship understanding, Pointing Game has been used as an evaluation metric for datasets with bounding box annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel suite of quantitative metrics that utilize GradCAM activations to rigorously evaluate the grounding capabilities of pre-trained VLMs like CLIP, BLIP, and ALBEF. These metrics offer an explainable and quantifiable approach for a more detailed comparison of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs and enable measuring models' grounding uncertainty. This characterization reveals interesting tradeoffs between the size of the model, the dataset size, and their performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19128v1,2024-04
Accelerating Production LLMs with Combined Token/Embedding Speculators,"Davis Wertheimer, Joshua Rosenkranz, Thomas Parnell, Sahil Suneja, Pavithra Ranganathan, Raghu Ganti, Mudhakar Srivatsa","This technical report describes the design and training of novel speculative decoding draft models, for accelerating the inference speeds of large language models in a production environment. By conditioning draft predictions on both context vectors and sampled tokens, we can train our speculators to efficiently predict high-quality n-grams, which the base model then accepts or rejects. This allows us to effectively predict multiple tokens per inference forward pass, accelerating wall-clock inference speeds of highly optimized base model implementations by a factor of 2-3x. We explore these initial results and describe next steps for further improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19124v2,2024-04
Effects of Added Emphasis and Pause in Audio Delivery of Health Information,"Arif Ahmed, Gondy Leroy, Stephen A. Rains, Philip Harber, David Kauchak, Prosanta Barai","Health literacy is crucial to supporting good health and is a major national goal. Audio delivery of information is becoming more popular for informing oneself. In this study, we evaluate the effect of audio enhancements in the form of information emphasis and pauses with health texts of varying difficulty and we measure health information comprehension and retention. We produced audio snippets from difficult and easy text and conducted the study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Our findings suggest that emphasis matters for both information comprehension and retention. When there is no added pause, emphasizing significant information can lower the perceived difficulty for difficult and easy texts. Comprehension is higher (54%) with correctly placed emphasis for the difficult texts compared to not adding emphasis (50%). Adding a pause lowers perceived difficulty and can improve retention but adversely affects information comprehension.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19119v1,2024-04
Text and Audio Simplification: Human vs. ChatGPT,"Gondy Leroy, David Kauchak, Philip Harber, Ankit Pal, Akash Shukla","Text and audio simplification to increase information comprehension are important in healthcare. With the introduction of ChatGPT, an evaluation of its simplification performance is needed. We provide a systematic comparison of human and ChatGPT simplified texts using fourteen metrics indicative of text difficulty. We briefly introduce our online editor where these simplification tools, including ChatGPT, are available. We scored twelve corpora using our metrics: six text, one audio, and five ChatGPT simplified corpora. We then compare these corpora with texts simplified and verified in a prior user study. Finally, a medical domain expert evaluated these texts and five, new ChatGPT simplified versions. We found that simple corpora show higher similarity with the human simplified texts. ChatGPT simplification moves metrics in the right direction. The medical domain expert evaluation showed a preference for the ChatGPT style, but the text itself was rated lower for content retention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01592v1,2024-04
In-Context Symbolic Regression: Leveraging Large Language Models for Function Discovery,"Matteo Merler, Katsiaryna Haitsiukevich, Nicola Dainese, Pekka Marttinen","State of the art Symbolic Regression (SR) methods currently build specialized models, while the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the first comprehensive framework that utilizes LLMs for the task of SR. We propose In-Context Symbolic Regression (ICSR), an SR method which iteratively refines a functional form with an LLM and determines its coefficients with an external optimizer. ICSR leverages LLMs' strong mathematical prior both to propose an initial set of possible functions given the observations and to refine them based on their errors. Our findings reveal that LLMs are able to successfully find symbolic equations that fit the given data, matching or outperforming the overall performance of the best SR baselines on four popular benchmarks, while yielding simpler equations with better out of distribution generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19094v2,2024-04
Blind Spots and Biases: Exploring the Role of Annotator Cognitive Biases in NLP,"Sanjana Gautam, Mukund Srinath","With the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence, there is growing concern over its potential to exacerbate existing biases and societal disparities and introduce novel ones. This issue has prompted widespread attention from academia, policymakers, industry, and civil society. While evidence suggests that integrating human perspectives can mitigate bias-related issues in AI systems, it also introduces challenges associated with cognitive biases inherent in human decision-making. Our research focuses on reviewing existing methodologies and ongoing investigations aimed at understanding annotation attributes that contribute to bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19071v1,2024-04
HELPER-X: A Unified Instructable Embodied Agent to Tackle Four Interactive Vision-Language Domains with Memory-Augmented Language Models,"Gabriel Sarch, Sahil Somani, Raghav Kapoor, Michael J. Tarr, Katerina Fragkiadaki","Recent research on instructable agents has used memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) as task planners, a technique that retrieves language-program examples relevant to the input instruction and uses them as in-context examples in the LLM prompt to improve the performance of the LLM in inferring the correct action and task plans. In this technical report, we extend the capabilities of HELPER, by expanding its memory with a wider array of examples and prompts, and by integrating additional APIs for asking questions. This simple expansion of HELPER into a shared memory enables the agent to work across the domains of executing plans from dialogue, natural language instruction following, active question asking, and commonsense room reorganization. We evaluate the agent on four diverse interactive visual-language embodied agent benchmarks: ALFRED, TEACh, DialFRED, and the Tidy Task. HELPER-X achieves few-shot, state-of-the-art performance across these benchmarks using a single agent, without requiring in-domain training, and remains competitive with agents that have undergone in-domain training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19065v1,2024-04
SuperCLUE-Fin: Graded Fine-Grained Analysis of Chinese LLMs on Diverse Financial Tasks and Applications,"Liang Xu, Lei Zhu, Yaotong Wu, Hang Xue","The SuperCLUE-Fin (SC-Fin) benchmark is a pioneering evaluation framework tailored for Chinese-native financial large language models (FLMs). It assesses FLMs across six financial application domains and twenty-five specialized tasks, encompassing theoretical knowledge and practical applications such as compliance, risk management, and investment analysis. Using multi-turn, open-ended conversations that mimic real-life scenarios, SC-Fin measures models on a range of criteria, including accurate financial understanding, logical reasoning, clarity, computational efficiency, business acumen, risk perception, and compliance with Chinese regulations.   In a rigorous evaluation involving over a thousand questions, SC-Fin identifies a performance hierarchy where domestic models like GLM-4 and MoonShot-v1-128k outperform others with an A-grade, highlighting the potential for further development in transforming theoretical knowledge into pragmatic financial solutions. This benchmark serves as a critical tool for refining FLMs in the Chinese context, directing improvements in financial knowledge databases, standardizing financial interpretations, and promoting models that prioritize compliance, risk management, and secure practices.   We create a contextually relevant and comprehensive benchmark that drives the development of AI in the Chinese financial sector. SC-Fin facilitates the advancement and responsible deployment of FLMs, offering valuable insights for enhancing model performance and usability for both individual and institutional users in the Chinese market..~\footnote{Our benchmark can be found at \url{https://www.CLUEbenchmarks.com}}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19063v1,2024-04
Plan of Thoughts: Heuristic-Guided Problem Solving with Large Language Models,Houjun Liu,"While language models (LMs) offer significant capability in zero-shot reasoning tasks across a wide range of domains, they do not perform satisfactorily in problems which requires multi-step reasoning. Previous approaches to mitigate this involves breaking a larger, multi-step task into sub-tasks and asking the language model to generate proposals (""thoughts"") for each sub-task and using exhaustive planning approaches such as DFS to compose a solution. In this work, we leverage this idea to introduce two new contributions: first, we formalize a planning-based approach to perform multi-step problem solving with LMs via Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), with the LM's own reflections about the value of a state used as a search heuristic; second, leveraging the online POMDP solver POMCP, we demonstrate a superior success rate of 89.4% on the Game of 24 task as compared to existing approaches while also offering better anytime performance characteristics than fixed tree-search which is used previously. Taken together, these contributions allow modern LMs to decompose and solve larger-scale reasoning tasks more effectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19055v1,2024-04
A Framework for Real-time Safeguarding the Text Generation of Large Language Model,"Ximing Dong, Dayi Lin, Shaowei Wang, Ahmed E. Hassan","Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks but also pose ethical and societal risks due to their propensity to generate harmful content. To address this, various approaches have been developed to safeguard LLMs from producing unsafe content. However, existing methods have limitations, including the need for training specific control models and proactive intervention during text generation, that lead to quality degradation and increased computational overhead. To mitigate those limitations, we propose LLMSafeGuard, a lightweight framework to safeguard LLM text generation in real-time. LLMSafeGuard integrates an external validator into the beam search algorithm during decoding, rejecting candidates that violate safety constraints while allowing valid ones to proceed. We introduce a similarity based validation approach, simplifying constraint introduction and eliminating the need for control model training. Additionally, LLMSafeGuard employs a context-wise timing selection strategy, intervening LLMs only when necessary. We evaluate LLMSafeGuard on two tasks, detoxification and copyright safeguarding, and demonstrate its superior performance over SOTA baselines. For instance, LLMSafeGuard reduces the average toxic score of. LLM output by 29.7% compared to the best baseline meanwhile preserving similar linguistic quality as natural output in detoxification task. Similarly, in the copyright task, LLMSafeGuard decreases the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) by 56.2% compared to baselines. Moreover, our context-wise timing selection strategy reduces inference time by at least 24% meanwhile maintaining comparable effectiveness as validating each time step. LLMSafeGuard also offers tunable parameters to balance its effectiveness and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19048v2,2024-04
How Did We Get Here? Summarizing Conversation Dynamics,"Yilun Hua, Nicholas Chernogor, Yuzhe Gu, Seoyeon Julie Jeong, Miranda Luo, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil","Throughout a conversation, the way participants interact with each other is in constant flux: their tones may change, they may resort to different strategies to convey their points, or they might alter their interaction patterns. An understanding of these dynamics can complement that of the actual facts and opinions discussed, offering a more holistic view of the trajectory of the conversation: how it arrived at its current state and where it is likely heading.   In this work, we introduce the task of summarizing the dynamics of conversations, by constructing a dataset of human-written summaries, and exploring several automated baselines. We evaluate whether such summaries can capture the trajectory of conversations via an established downstream task: forecasting whether an ongoing conversation will eventually derail into toxic behavior. We show that they help both humans and automated systems with this forecasting task. Humans make predictions three times faster, and with greater confidence, when reading the summaries than when reading the transcripts. Furthermore, automated forecasting systems are more accurate when constructing, and then predicting based on, summaries of conversation dynamics, compared to directly predicting on the transcripts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19007v1,2024-04
Stylus: Automatic Adapter Selection for Diffusion Models,"Michael Luo, Justin Wong, Brandon Trabucco, Yanping Huang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Zhifeng Chen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Ion Stoica","Beyond scaling base models with more data or parameters, fine-tuned adapters provide an alternative way to generate high fidelity, custom images at reduced costs. As such, adapters have been widely adopted by open-source communities, accumulating a database of over 100K adapters-most of which are highly customized with insufficient descriptions. This paper explores the problem of matching the prompt to a set of relevant adapters, built on recent work that highlight the performance gains of composing adapters. We introduce Stylus, which efficiently selects and automatically composes task-specific adapters based on a prompt's keywords. Stylus outlines a three-stage approach that first summarizes adapters with improved descriptions and embeddings, retrieves relevant adapters, and then further assembles adapters based on prompts' keywords by checking how well they fit the prompt. To evaluate Stylus, we developed StylusDocs, a curated dataset featuring 75K adapters with pre-computed adapter embeddings. In our evaluation on popular Stable Diffusion checkpoints, Stylus achieves greater CLIP-FID Pareto efficiency and is twice as preferred, with humans and multimodal models as evaluators, over the base model.

Holmes: A Benchmark to Assess the Linguistic Competence of Language Models,"Andreas Waldis, Yotam Perlitz, Leshem Choshen, Yufang Hou, Iryna Gurevych","We introduce Holmes, a new benchmark designed to assess language models (LMs) linguistic competence - their unconscious understanding of linguistic phenomena. Specifically, we use classifier-based probing to examine LMs' internal representations regarding distinct linguistic phenomena (e.g., part-of-speech tagging). As a result, we meet recent calls to disentangle LMs' linguistic competence from other cognitive abilities, such as following instructions in prompting-based evaluations. Composing Holmes, we review over 270 probing studies and include more than 200 datasets to assess syntax, morphology, semantics, reasoning, and discourse phenomena. Analyzing over 50 LMs reveals that, aligned with known trends, their linguistic competence correlates with model size. However, surprisingly, model architecture and instruction tuning also significantly influence performance, particularly in morphology and syntax. Finally, we propose FlashHolmes, a streamlined version that reduces the computation load while maintaining high-ranking precision.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18923v4,2024-04
DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF,"Han Zhong, Guhao Feng, Wei Xiong, Xinle Cheng, Li Zhao, Di He, Jiang Bian, Liwei Wang","In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of state-of-the-art closed-source large language models (LLMs), its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal, as widely reported by numerous research studies. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights that demonstrate the superiority of our MDP framework over the previous sentence-level bandit formulation. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm, dubbed as Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive real-world alignment experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18922v2,2024-04
Kangaroo: Lossless Self-Speculative Decoding via Double Early Exiting,"Fangcheng Liu, Yehui Tang, Zhenhua Liu, Yunsheng Ni, Kai Han, Yunhe Wang","Speculative decoding has demonstrated its effectiveness in accelerating the inference of large language models while maintaining a consistent sampling distribution. However, the conventional approach of training a separate draft model to achieve a satisfactory token acceptance rate can be costly. Drawing inspiration from early exiting, we propose a novel self-speculative decoding framework \emph{Kangaroo}, which uses a fixed shallow sub-network as a self-draft model, with the remaining layers serving as the larger target model. We train a lightweight and efficient adapter module on top of the sub-network to bridge the gap between the sub-network and the full model's representation ability. It is noteworthy that the inference latency of the self-draft model may no longer be negligible compared to the large model, necessitating strategies to increase the token acceptance rate while minimizing the drafting steps of the small model. To address this challenge, we introduce an additional early exiting mechanism for generating draft tokens. Specifically, we halt the small model's subsequent prediction during the drafting phase once the confidence level for the current token falls below a certain threshold. Extensive experiments on the Spec-Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of Kangaroo. Under single-sequence verification, Kangaroo achieves speedups up to $1.68\times$ on Spec-Bench, outperforming Medusa-1 with 88.7\% fewer additional parameters (67M compared to 591M). The code for Kangaroo is available at https://github.com/Equationliu/Kangaroo.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18911v1,2024-04
Markovian Transformers for Informative Language Modeling,"Scott Viteri, Max Lamparth, Peter Chatain, Clark Barrett","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning holds great promise for explaining language model outputs, but recent studies have highlighted significant challenges in its practical application for interpretability. We propose to address this issue by making CoT causally essential to prediction through two key components: factoring next-token prediction through intermediate CoT text, and training CoT to predict future tokens independently of other context. This results in ""Markovian"" language models, where CoT serves as a fixed-size state for future token prediction. Our approach optimizes for ""informativeness"" - the improvement in next-token predictions using a trained CoT compared to a baseline. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for arithmetic problems and policy gradient for GSM8K, we demonstrate effectiveness on both arithmetic problems with Mistral 7B and the GSM8K benchmark with Llama 3.1 8B, where the model learns to produce CoTs that are 33.20% more effective at predicting answers than the pre-trained baseline. The increased sensitivity of model performance to CoT perturbations provides strong evidence of CoT reliance. Furthermore, we show that CoTs trained for one model generalize to help other models predict answers, suggesting these CoTs capture reasoning patterns that transfer across different interpreters. This work advances the development of more interpretable language models, potentially enabling their extension to arbitrarily long contexts and enhancing AI reasoning capabilities across various domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18988v4,2024-04
Spivavtor: An Instruction Tuned Ukrainian Text Editing Model,"Aman Saini, Artem Chernodub, Vipul Raheja, Vivek Kulkarni","We introduce Spivavtor, a dataset, and instruction-tuned models for text editing focused on the Ukrainian language. Spivavtor is the Ukrainian-focused adaptation of the English-only CoEdIT model. Similar to CoEdIT, Spivavtor performs text editing tasks by following instructions in Ukrainian. This paper describes the details of the Spivavtor-Instruct dataset and Spivavtor models. We evaluate Spivavtor on a variety of text editing tasks in Ukrainian, such as Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), Text Simplification, Coherence, and Paraphrasing, and demonstrate its superior performance on all of them. We publicly release our best-performing models and data as resources to the community to advance further research in this space.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18880v1,2024-04
"More RLHF, More Trust? On The Impact of Preference Alignment On Trustworthiness","Aaron J. Li, Satyapriya Krishna, Himabindu Lakkaraju","The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18870v2,2024-04
Truth-value judgment in language models: belief directions are context sensitive,"Stefan F. Schouten, Peter Bloem, Ilia Markov, Piek Vossen","Recent work has demonstrated that the latent spaces of large language models (LLMs) contain directions predictive of the truth of sentences. Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as getting at a model's ""knowledge"" or ""beliefs"". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions can be described as being conditional on the preceding (related) sentences. Specifically, we quantify the responsiveness of the probes to the presence of (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences, and score the probes on their consistency. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these belief directions influences the position of the hypothesis along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the (type of) model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that belief directions are (one of the) causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18865v1,2024-04
A Comprehensive Rubric for Annotating Pathological Speech,"Mario Corrales-Astorgano, David Escudero-Mancebo, Lourdes Aguilar, Valle Flores-Lucas, Valentín Cardeñoso-Payo, Carlos Vivaracho-Pascual, César González-Ferreras","Rubrics are a commonly used tool for labeling voice corpora in speech quality assessment, although their application in the context of pathological speech remains relatively limited. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive rubric based on various dimensions of speech quality, including phonetics, fluency, and prosody. The objective is to establish standardized criteria for identifying errors within the speech of individuals with Down syndrome, thereby enabling the development of automated assessment systems. To achieve this objective, we utilized the Prautocal corpus. To assess the quality of annotations using our rubric, two experiments were conducted, focusing on phonetics and fluency. For phonetic evaluation, we employed the Goodness of Pronunciation (GoP) metric, utilizing automatic segmentation systems and correlating the results with evaluations conducted by a specialized speech therapist. While the obtained correlation values were not notably high, a positive trend was observed. In terms of fluency assessment, deep learning models like wav2vec were used to extract audio features, and we employed an SVM classifier trained on a corpus focused on identifying fluency issues to categorize Prautocal corpus samples. The outcomes highlight the complexities of evaluating such phenomena, with variability depending on the specific type of disfluency detected.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18851v1,2024-04
FeDeRA:Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models in Federated Learning Leveraging Weight Decomposition,"Yuxuan Yan, Qianqian Yang, Shunpu Tang, Zhiguo Shi","Despite their exceptional performance on various tasks after fine-tuning, pre-trained language models (PLMs) face significant challenges due to growing privacy concerns with data in centralized training methods. We consider federated learning (FL) to fine-tune PLMs in this paper. However, the substantial number of parameters in PLMs poses significant difficulties for client devices with limited communication and computational resources. One promising solution is to exploit parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) into FL, which trains a much smaller set of parameters than full parameter fine-tuning (FFT). Although remarkably improving training efficiency, PEFT methods may lead to degraded performance especially when data across different clients are non i.i.d, as revealed by experimental results. To overcome this, we propose FeDeRA, which extends and improves a widely used PEFT method, i.e., low-rank adaption (LoRA). FeDeRA follows LoRA by decomposing the weight matrices of the PLMs into low-rank matrices, which allows for more efficient computation and parameter updates during fine-tuning. Different from LoRA which simply initializes these low-rank matrices by random sampling or zeros, the proposed FeDeRA initializes these matrices by the results of performing singular value decomposition (SVD) on the pre-trained weight matrices. Extensive experiments across various tasks and datasets show that FeDeRA outperforms the considered PEFT baselines and is comparable to or even surpasses FFT method within the FL setting in terms of task performance. Moreover, FeDeRA requires only 1% trainable paramentes compared to FFT, significantly reducing training time costs by more than 90% to achieve the same task performance level. The experimental results also highlight the robustness of FeDeRA against data heterogeneity, as it maintains stable task performance even as data heterogeneity increases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18848v3,2024-04
It's Difficult to be Neutral -- Human and LLM-based Sentiment Annotation of Patient Comments,"Petter Mæhlum, David Samuel, Rebecka Maria Norman, Elma Jelin, Øyvind Andresen Bjertnæs, Lilja Øvrelid, Erik Velldal","Sentiment analysis is an important tool for aggregating patient voices, in order to provide targeted improvements in healthcare services. A prerequisite for this is the availability of in-domain data annotated for sentiment. This article documents an effort to add sentiment annotations to free-text comments in patient surveys collected by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). However, annotation can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, particularly when it requires domain expertise. We therefore also evaluate a possible alternative to human annotation, using large language models (LLMs) as annotators. We perform an extensive evaluation of the approach for two openly available pretrained LLMs for Norwegian, experimenting with different configurations of prompts and in-context learning, comparing their performance to human annotators. We find that even for zero-shot runs, models perform well above the baseline for binary sentiment, but still cannot compete with human annotators on the full dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18832v1,2024-04
Benchmarking Benchmark Leakage in Large Language Models,"Ruijie Xu, Zengzhi Wang, Run-Ze Fan, Pengfei Liu","Amid the expanding use of pre-training data, the phenomenon of benchmark dataset leakage has become increasingly prominent, exacerbated by opaque training processes and the often undisclosed inclusion of supervised data in contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue skews benchmark effectiveness and fosters potentially unfair comparisons, impeding the field's healthy development. To address this, we introduce a detection pipeline utilizing Perplexity and N-gram accuracy, two simple and scalable metrics that gauge a model's prediction precision on benchmark, to identify potential data leakages. By analyzing 31 LLMs under the context of mathematical reasoning, we reveal substantial instances of training even test set misuse, resulting in potentially unfair comparisons. These findings prompt us to offer several recommendations regarding model documentation, benchmark setup, and future evaluations. Notably, we propose the ""Benchmark Transparency Card"" to encourage clear documentation of benchmark utilization, promoting transparency and healthy developments of LLMs. we have made our leaderboard, pipeline implementation, and model predictions publicly available, fostering future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18824v1,2024-04
Unknown Script: Impact of Script on Cross-Lingual Transfer,"Wondimagegnhue Tsegaye Tufa, Ilia Markov, Piek Vossen","Cross-lingual transfer has become an effective way of transferring knowledge between languages. In this paper, we explore an often overlooked aspect in this domain: the influence of the source language of a language model on language transfer performance. We consider a case where the target language and its script are not part of the pre-trained model. We conduct a series of experiments on monolingual and multilingual models that are pre-trained on different tokenization methods to determine factors that affect cross-lingual transfer to a new language with a unique script. Our findings reveal the importance of the tokenizer as a stronger factor than the shared script, language similarity, and model size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18810v2,2024-04
Replacing Judges with Juries: Evaluating LLM Generations with a Panel of Diverse Models,"Pat Verga, Sebastian Hofstatter, Sophia Althammer, Yixuan Su, Aleksandra Piktus, Arkady Arkhangorodsky, Minjie Xu, Naomi White, Patrick Lewis","As Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more advanced, they have outpaced our abilities to accurately evaluate their quality. Not only is finding data to adequately probe particular model properties difficult, but evaluating the correctness of a model's freeform generation alone is a challenge. To address this, many evaluations now rely on using LLMs themselves as judges to score the quality of outputs from other LLMs. Evaluations most commonly use a single large model like GPT4. While this method has grown in popularity, it is costly, has been shown to introduce intramodel bias, and in this work, we find that very large models are often unnecessary. We propose instead to evaluate models using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL). Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18796v2,2024-04
Where on Earth Do Users Say They Are?: Geo-Entity Linking for Noisy Multilingual User Input,"Tessa Masis, Brendan O'Connor","Geo-entity linking is the task of linking a location mention to the real-world geographic location. In this paper we explore the challenging task of geo-entity linking for noisy, multilingual social media data. There are few open-source multilingual geo-entity linking tools available and existing ones are often rule-based, which break easily in social media settings, or LLM-based, which are too expensive for large-scale datasets. We present a method which represents real-world locations as averaged embeddings from labeled user-input location names and allows for selective prediction via an interpretable confidence score. We show that our approach improves geo-entity linking on a global and multilingual social media dataset, and discuss progress and problems with evaluating at different geographic granularities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18784v1,2024-04
Towards A Structured Overview of Use Cases for Natural Language Processing in the Legal Domain: A German Perspective,"Juraj Vladika, Stephen Meisenbacher, Martina Preis, Alexandra Klymenko, Florian Matthes","In recent years, the field of Legal Tech has risen in prevalence, as the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and legal disciplines have combined forces to digitalize legal processes. Amidst the steady flow of research solutions stemming from the NLP domain, the study of use cases has fallen behind, leading to a number of innovative technical methods without a place in practice. In this work, we aim to build a structured overview of Legal Tech use cases, grounded in NLP literature, but also supplemented by voices from legal practice in Germany. Based upon a Systematic Literature Review, we identify seven categories of NLP technologies for the legal domain, which are then studied in juxtaposition to 22 legal use cases. In the investigation of these use cases, we identify 15 ethical, legal, and social aspects (ELSA), shedding light on the potential concerns of digitally transforming the legal domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18759v2,2024-04
Computational Job Market Analysis with Natural Language Processing,Mike Zhang,"[Abridged Abstract]   Recent technological advances underscore labor market dynamics, yielding significant consequences for employment prospects and increasing job vacancy data across platforms and languages. Aggregating such data holds potential for valuable insights into labor market demands, new skills emergence, and facilitating job matching for various stakeholders. However, despite prevalent insights in the private sector, transparent language technology systems and data for this domain are lacking. This thesis investigates Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology for extracting relevant information from job descriptions, identifying challenges including scarcity of training data, lack of standardized annotation guidelines, and shortage of effective extraction methods from job ads. We frame the problem, obtaining annotated data, and introducing extraction methodologies. Our contributions include job description datasets, a de-identification dataset, and a novel active learning algorithm for efficient model training. We propose skill extraction using weak supervision, a taxonomy-aware pre-training methodology adapting multilingual language models to the job market domain, and a retrieval-augmented model leveraging multiple skill extraction datasets to enhance overall performance. Finally, we ground extracted information within a designated taxonomy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18977v1,2024-04
Foundations of Multisensory Artificial Intelligence,Paul Pu Liang,"Building multisensory AI systems that learn from multiple sensory inputs such as text, speech, video, real-world sensors, wearable devices, and medical data holds great promise for impact in many scientific areas with practical benefits, such as in supporting human health and well-being, enabling multimedia content processing, and enhancing real-world autonomous agents. By synthesizing a range of theoretical frameworks and application domains, this thesis aims to advance the machine learning foundations of multisensory AI. In the first part, we present a theoretical framework formalizing how modalities interact with each other to give rise to new information for a task. These interactions are the basic building blocks in all multimodal problems, and their quantification enables users to understand their multimodal datasets, design principled approaches to learn these interactions, and analyze whether their model has succeeded in learning. In the second part, we study the design of practical multimodal foundation models that generalize over many modalities and tasks, which presents a step toward grounding large language models to real-world sensory modalities. We introduce MultiBench, a unified large-scale benchmark across a wide range of modalities, tasks, and research areas, followed by the cross-modal attention and multimodal transformer architectures that now underpin many of today's multimodal foundation models. Scaling these architectures on MultiBench enables the creation of general-purpose multisensory AI systems, and we discuss our collaborative efforts in applying these models for real-world impact in affective computing, mental health, cancer prognosis, and robotics. Finally, we conclude this thesis by discussing how future work can leverage these ideas toward more general, interactive, and safe multisensory AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18976v1,2024-04
Towards Dog Bark Decoding: Leveraging Human Speech Processing for Automated Bark Classification,"Artem Abzaliev, Humberto Pérez Espinosa, Rada Mihalcea","Similar to humans, animals make extensive use of verbal and non-verbal forms of communication, including a large range of audio signals. In this paper, we address dog vocalizations and explore the use of self-supervised speech representation models pre-trained on human speech to address dog bark classification tasks that find parallels in human-centered tasks in speech recognition. We specifically address four tasks: dog recognition, breed identification, gender classification, and context grounding. We show that using speech embedding representations significantly improves over simpler classification baselines. Further, we also find that models pre-trained on large human speech acoustics can provide additional performance boosts on several tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18739v1,2024-04
The Constant in HATE: Analyzing Toxicity in Reddit across Topics and Languages,"Wondimagegnhue Tsegaye Tufa, Ilia Markov, Piek Vossen","Toxic language remains an ongoing challenge on social media platforms, presenting significant issues for users and communities. This paper provides a cross-topic and cross-lingual analysis of toxicity in Reddit conversations. We collect 1.5 million comment threads from 481 communities in six languages: English, German, Spanish, Turkish,Arabic, and Dutch, covering 80 topics such as Culture, Politics, and News. We thoroughly analyze how toxicity spikes within different communities in relation to specific topics. We observe consistent patterns of increased toxicity across languages for certain topics, while also noting significant variations within specific language communities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18726v1,2024-04
Improving Automatic Text Recognition with Language Models in the PyLaia Open-Source Library,"Solène Tarride, Yoann Schneider, Marie Generali-Lince, Mélodie Boillet, Bastien Abadie, Christopher Kermorvant","PyLaia is one of the most popular open-source software for Automatic Text Recognition (ATR), delivering strong performance in terms of speed and accuracy. In this paper, we outline our recent contributions to the PyLaia library, focusing on the incorporation of reliable confidence scores and the integration of statistical language modeling during decoding. Our implementation provides an easy way to combine PyLaia with n-grams language models at different levels. One of the highlights of this work is that language models are completely auto-tuned: they can be built and used easily without any expert knowledge, and without requiring any additional data. To demonstrate the significance of our contribution, we evaluate PyLaia's performance on twelve datasets, both with and without language modelling. The results show that decoding with small language models improves the Word Error Rate by 13% and the Character Error Rate by 12% in average. Additionally, we conduct an analysis of confidence scores and highlight the importance of calibration techniques. Our implementation is publicly available in the official PyLaia repository at https://gitlab.teklia.com/atr/pylaia, and twelve open-source models are released on Hugging Face.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18722v1,2024-04
Iconic Gesture Semantics,"Andy Lücking, Alexander Henlein, Alexander Mehler","The ""meaning"" of an iconic gesture is conditioned on its informational evaluation. Only informational evaluation lifts a gesture to a quasi-linguistic level that can interact with verbal content. Interaction is either vacuous or regimented by usual lexicon-driven inferences. Informational evaluation is spelled out as extended exemplification (extemplification) in terms of perceptual classification of a gesture's visual iconic model. The iconic model is derived from Frege/Montague-like truth-functional evaluation of a gesture's form within spatially extended domains. We further argue that the perceptual classification of instances of visual communication requires a notion of meaning different from Frege/Montague frameworks. Therefore, a heuristic for gesture interpretation is provided that can guide the working semanticist. In sum, an iconic gesture semantics is introduced which covers the full range from kinematic gesture representations over model-theoretic evaluation to inferential interpretation in dynamic semantic frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18708v1,2024-04
"Credible, Unreliable or Leaked?: Evidence Verification for Enhanced Automated Fact-checking","Zacharias Chrysidis, Stefanos-Iordanis Papadopoulos, Symeon Papadopoulos, Panagiotis C. Petrantonakis","Automated fact-checking (AFC) is garnering increasing attention by researchers aiming to help fact-checkers combat the increasing spread of misinformation online. While many existing AFC methods incorporate external information from the Web to help examine the veracity of claims, they often overlook the importance of verifying the source and quality of collected ""evidence"". One overlooked challenge involves the reliance on ""leaked evidence"", information gathered directly from fact-checking websites and used to train AFC systems, resulting in an unrealistic setting for early misinformation detection. Similarly, the inclusion of information from unreliable sources can undermine the effectiveness of AFC systems. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to evidence verification and filtering. We create the ""CREDible, Unreliable or LEaked"" (CREDULE) dataset, which consists of 91,632 articles classified as Credible, Unreliable and Fact checked (Leaked). Additionally, we introduce the EVidence VERification Network (EVVER-Net), trained on CREDULE to detect leaked and unreliable evidence in both short and long texts. EVVER-Net can be used to filter evidence collected from the Web, thus enhancing the robustness of end-to-end AFC systems. We experiment with various language models and show that EVVER-Net can demonstrate impressive performance of up to 91.5% and 94.4% accuracy, while leveraging domain credibility scores along with short or long texts, respectively. Finally, we assess the evidence provided by widely-used fact-checking datasets including LIAR-PLUS, MOCHEG, FACTIFY, NewsCLIPpings+ and VERITE, some of which exhibit concerning rates of leaked and unreliable evidence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18971v1,2024-04
Work Smarter...Not Harder: Efficient Minimization of Dependency Length in SOV Languages,"Sidharth Ranjan, Titus von der Malsburg","Dependency length minimization is a universally observed quantitative property of natural languages. However, the extent of dependency length minimization, and the cognitive mechanisms through which the language processor achieves this minimization remain unclear. This research offers mechanistic insights by postulating that moving a short preverbal constituent next to the main verb explains preverbal constituent ordering decisions better than global minimization of dependency length in SOV languages. This approach constitutes a least-effort strategy because it's just one operation but simultaneously reduces the length of all preverbal dependencies linked to the main verb. We corroborate this strategy using large-scale corpus evidence across all seven SOV languages that are prominently represented in the Universal Dependency Treebank. These findings align with the concept of bounded rationality, where decision-making is influenced by 'quick-yet-economical' heuristics rather than exhaustive searches for optimal solutions. Overall, this work sheds light on the role of bounded rationality in linguistic decision-making and language evolution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18684v2,2024-04
Simplifying Multimodality: Unimodal Approach to Multimodal Challenges in Radiology with General-Domain Large Language Model,"Seonhee Cho, Choonghan Kim, Jiho Lee, Chetan Chilkunda, Sujin Choi, Joo Heung Yoon","Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have attracted interest in their generalization capability with only a few samples in the prompt. This progress is particularly relevant to the medical domain, where the quality and sensitivity of data pose unique challenges for model training and application. However, the dependency on high-quality data for effective in-context learning raises questions about the feasibility of these models when encountering with the inevitable variations and errors inherent in real-world medical data. In this paper, we introduce MID-M, a novel framework that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of a general-domain Large Language Model (LLM) to process multimodal data via image descriptions. MID-M achieves a comparable or superior performance to task-specific fine-tuned LMMs and other general-domain ones, without the extensive domain-specific training or pre-training on multimodal data, with significantly fewer parameters. This highlights the potential of leveraging general-domain LLMs for domain-specific tasks and offers a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional LMM developments. Moreover, the robustness of MID-M against data quality issues demonstrates its practical utility in real-world medical domain applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01591v1,2024-04
101 Billion Arabic Words Dataset,"Manel Aloui, Hasna Chouikhi, Ghaith Chaabane, Haithem Kchaou, Chehir Dhaouadi","In recent years, Large Language Models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, showcasing an impressive rise predominantly in English-centric domains. These advancements have set a global benchmark, inspiring significant efforts toward developing Arabic LLMs capable of understanding and generating the Arabic language with remarkable accuracy. Despite these advancements, a critical challenge persists: the potential bias in Arabic LLMs, primarily attributed to their reliance on datasets comprising English data that has been translated into Arabic. This reliance not only compromises the authenticity of the generated content but also reflects a broader issue -the scarcity of original quality Arabic linguistic data. This study aims to address the data scarcity in the Arab world and to encourage the development of Arabic Language Models that are true to both the linguistic and nuances of the region. We undertook a large-scale data mining project, extracting a substantial volume of text from the Common Crawl WET files, specifically targeting Arabic content. The extracted data underwent a rigorous cleaning and deduplication process, using innovative techniques to ensure the integrity and uniqueness of the dataset. The result is the 101 Billion Arabic Words Dataset, the largest Arabic dataset available to date, which can significantly contribute to the development of authentic Arabic LLMs. This study not only highlights the potential for creating linguistically and culturally accurate Arabic LLMs but also sets a precedent for future research in enhancing the authenticity of Arabic language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01590v1,2024-04
Revealing the Parametric Knowledge of Language Models: A Unified Framework for Attribution Methods,"Haeun Yu, Pepa Atanasova, Isabelle Augenstein","Language Models (LMs) acquire parametric knowledge from their training process, embedding it within their weights. The increasing scalability of LMs, however, poses significant challenges for understanding a model's inner workings and further for updating or correcting this embedded knowledge without the significant cost of retraining. This underscores the importance of unveiling exactly what knowledge is stored and its association with specific model components. Instance Attribution (IA) and Neuron Attribution (NA) offer insights into this training-acquired knowledge, though they have not been compared systematically. Our study introduces a novel evaluation framework to quantify and compare the knowledge revealed by IA and NA. To align the results of the methods we introduce the attribution method NA-Instances to apply NA for retrieving influential training instances, and IA-Neurons to discover important neurons of influential instances discovered by IA. We further propose a comprehensive list of faithfulness tests to evaluate the comprehensiveness and sufficiency of the explanations provided by both methods. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that NA generally reveals more diverse and comprehensive information regarding the LM's parametric knowledge compared to IA. Nevertheless, IA provides unique and valuable insights into the LM's parametric knowledge, which are not revealed by NA. Our findings further suggest the potential of a synergistic approach of combining the diverse findings of IA and NA for a more holistic understanding of an LM's parametric knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18655v1,2024-04
A cost minimization approach to fix the vocabulary size in a tokenizer for an End-to-End ASR system,"Sunil Kumar Kopparapu, Ashish Panda","Unlike hybrid speech recognition systems where the use of tokens was restricted to phones, biphones or triphones the choice of tokens in the end-to-end ASR systems is derived from the text corpus of the training data. The use of tokenization algorithms like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece is popular in identifying the tokens that are used in the overall training process of the speech recognition system. Popular toolkits, like ESPNet use a pre-defined vocabulary size (number of tokens) for these tokenization algorithms, but there is no discussion on how vocabulary size was derived. In this paper, we build a cost function, assuming the tokenization process to be a black-box to enable choosing the number of tokens which might most benefit building an end-to-end ASR. We show through experiments on LibriSpeech 100 hour set that the performance of an end-to-end ASR system improves when the number of tokens are chosen carefully.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02563v1,2024-04
Reinforcement Learning Problem Solving with Large Language Models,"Sina Gholamian, Domingo Huh","Large Language Models (LLMs) encapsulate an extensive amount of world knowledge, and this has enabled their application in various domains to improve the performance of a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This has also facilitated a more accessible paradigm of conversation-based interactions between humans and AI systems to solve intended problems. However, one interesting avenue that shows untapped potential is the use of LLMs as Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to enable conversational RL problem solving. Therefore, in this study, we explore the concept of formulating Markov Decision Process-based RL problems as LLM prompting tasks. We demonstrate how LLMs can be iteratively prompted to learn and optimize policies for specific RL tasks. In addition, we leverage the introduced prompting technique for episode simulation and Q-Learning, facilitated by LLMs. We then show the practicality of our approach through two detailed case studies for ""Research Scientist"" and ""Legal Matter Intake"" workflows.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18638v1,2024-04
Do Vision & Language Decoders use Images and Text equally? How Self-consistent are their Explanations?,"Letitia Parcalabescu, Anette Frank","Vision and language model (VLM) decoders are currently the best-performing architectures on multimodal tasks. Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18624v3,2024-04

FREB-TQA: A Fine-Grained Robustness Evaluation Benchmark for Table Question Answering,"Wei Zhou, Mohsen Mesgar, Heike Adel, Annemarie Friedrich","Table Question Answering (TQA) aims at composing an answer to a question based on tabular data. While prior research has shown that TQA models lack robustness, understanding the underlying cause and nature of this issue remains predominantly unclear, posing a significant obstacle to the development of robust TQA systems. In this paper, we formalize three major desiderata for a fine-grained evaluation of robustness of TQA systems. They should (i) answer questions regardless of alterations in table structure, (ii) base their responses on the content of relevant cells rather than on biases, and (iii) demonstrate robust numerical reasoning capabilities. To investigate these aspects, we create and publish a novel TQA evaluation benchmark in English. Our extensive experimental analysis reveals that none of the examined state-of-the-art TQA systems consistently excels in these three aspects. Our benchmark is a crucial instrument for monitoring the behavior of TQA systems and paves the way for the development of robust TQA systems. We release our benchmark publicly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18585v1,2024-04
PoPE: Legendre Orthogonal Polynomials Based Position Encoding for Large Language Models,Arpit Aggarwal,"There are several improvements proposed over the baseline Absolute Positional Encoding (APE) method used in original transformer. In this study, we aim to investigate the implications of inadequately representing positional encoding in higher dimensions on crucial aspects of the attention mechanism, the model's capacity to learn relative positional information, and the convergence of models, all stemming from the choice of sinusoidal basis functions. Through a combination of theoretical insights and empirical analyses, we elucidate how these challenges extend beyond APEs and may adversely affect the performance of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) methods, such as Rotatory Positional Encoding (RoPE).   Subsequently, we introduce an innovative solution termed Orthogonal Polynomial Based Positional Encoding (PoPE) to address some of the limitations associated with existing methods. The PoPE method encodes positional information by leveraging Orthogonal Legendre polynomials. Legendre polynomials as basis functions offers several desirable properties for positional encoding, including improved correlation structure, non-periodicity, orthogonality, and distinct functional forms among polynomials of varying orders. Our experimental findings demonstrate that transformer models incorporating PoPE outperform baseline transformer models on the $Multi30k$ English-to-German translation task, thus establishing a new performance benchmark. Furthermore, PoPE-based transformers exhibit significantly accelerated convergence rates.   Additionally, we will present novel theoretical perspectives on position encoding based on the superior performance of PoPE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04585v1,2024-04
Analyzing Semantic Change through Lexical Replacements,"Francesco Periti, Pierluigi Cassotti, Haim Dubossarsky, Nina Tahmasebi","Modern language models are capable of contextualizing words based on their surrounding context. However, this capability is often compromised due to semantic change that leads to words being used in new, unexpected contexts not encountered during pre-training. In this paper, we model \textit{semantic change} by studying the effect of unexpected contexts introduced by \textit{lexical replacements}. We propose a \textit{replacement schema} where a target word is substituted with lexical replacements of varying relatedness, thus simulating different kinds of semantic change. Furthermore, we leverage the replacement schema as a basis for a novel \textit{interpretable} model for semantic change. We are also the first to evaluate the use of LLaMa for semantic change detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18570v1,2024-04
Injecting Salesperson's Dialogue Strategies in Large Language Models with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,"Wen-Yu Chang, Yun-Nung Chen","Recent research in dialogue systems and corpora has focused on two main categories: task-oriented (TOD) and open-domain (chit-chat) dialogues. TOD systems help users accomplish specific tasks, while open-domain systems aim to create engaging conversations. However, in real-world scenarios, user intents are often revealed during interactions. A recent study introduced SalesBot, which simulates dialogues transitioning from chit-chat to task-oriented scenarios to train sales agents. Unfortunately, the initial data lacked smooth transitions and coherent long-turn dialogues, resulting in poor naturalness in sales-customer interactions. To address these issues, this paper presents SalesBot 2.0, an improved dataset. It leverages commonsense knowledge from large language models (LLMs) through strategic prompting. Additionally, we introduce a novel model called SalesAgent, trained on salesperson's interactions, using chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This model excels in transitioning topics, understanding user intents, and selecting appropriate strategies. Experiments using diverse user simulations validate the effectiveness of our method in controlling dialogue strategies in LLMs. Furthermore, SalesBot 2.0 enhances coherence and reduces aggression, facilitating better model learning for sales-customer interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18564v1,2024-04
Can GPT-4 do L2 analytic assessment?,"Stefano Bannò, Hari Krishna Vydana, Kate M. Knill, Mark J. F.

Although holistic scoring has seen advancements in AES that match or even exceed human performance, analytic scoring still encounters issues as it inherits flaws and shortcomings from the human scoring process. The recent introduction of large language models presents new opportunities for automating the evaluation of specific aspects of L2 writing proficiency. In this paper, we perform a series of experiments using GPT-4 in a zero-shot fashion on a publicly available dataset annotated with holistic scores based on the Common European Framework of Reference and aim to extract detailed information about their underlying analytic components. We observe significant correlations between the automatically predicted analytic scores and multiple features associated with the individual proficiency components.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18557v1,2024-04
Time Machine GPT,"Felix Drinkall, Eghbal Rahimikia, Janet B.

This approach is not aligned with the evolving nature of language. Conventional methods for creating temporally adapted language models often depend on further pre-training static models on time-specific data. This paper presents a new approach: a series of point-in-time LLMs called Time Machine GPT (TiMaGPT), specifically designed to be nonprognosticative. This ensures they remain uninformed about future factual information and linguistic changes. This strategy is beneficial for understanding language evolution and is of critical importance when applying models in dynamic contexts, such as time-series forecasting, where foresight of future information can prove problematic.

Evaluating and Mitigating Linguistic Discrimination in Large Language Models,"Guoliang Dong, Haoyu Wang, Jun Sun, Xinyu Wang","By training on text in various languages, large language models (LLMs) typically possess multilingual support and demonstrate remarkable capabilities in solving tasks described in different languages. However, LLMs can exhibit linguistic discrimination due to the uneven distribution of training data across languages. That is, LLMs are hard to keep the consistency of responses when faced with the same task but depicted in different languages.   In this study, we first explore the consistency in the LLMs' outputs responding to queries in various languages from two aspects: safety and quality. We conduct this analysis with two datasets (AdvBench and NQ) based on four LLMs (Llama2-13b, Gemma-7b, GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-pro). The results show that LLMs exhibit stronger human alignment capabilities with queries in English, French, Russian, and Spanish (only 1.04\% of harmful queries successfully jailbreak on average) compared to queries in Bengali, Georgian, Nepali and Maithili (27.7\% of harmful queries jailbreak successfully on average). Moreover, for queries in English, Danish, Czech and Slovenian, LLMs tend to produce responses with a higher quality (with 0.1494 $F_1$ score on average) compared to the other languages. Upon these findings, we propose LDFighter, a similarity-based voting, to mitigate the linguistic discrimination in LLMs. LDFighter ensures consistent service for different language speakers. We evaluate LDFighter with both benign queries and harmful queries. The results show that LDFighter not only significantly reduces the jailbreak success rate but also improve the response quality on average, demonstrating its effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18534v2,2024-04
MileBench: Benchmarking MLLMs in Long Context,"Dingjie Song, Shunian Chen, Guiming Hardy Chen, Fei Yu, Xiang Wan, Benyou Wang","Despite the advancements and impressive performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on benchmarks, their effectiveness in real-world, long-context, and multi-image tasks is unclear due to the benchmarks' limited scope. Existing benchmarks often focus on single-image and short-text samples, and when assessing multi-image tasks, they either limit the image count or focus on specific task (e.g time-series captioning), potentially obscuring the performance challenges of MLLMs. To address these limitations, we introduce MileBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to test the MultImodal Long-contExt capabilities of MLLMs. This benchmark comprises not only multimodal long contexts, but also multiple tasks requiring both comprehension and generation. We establish two distinct evaluation sets, diagnostic and realistic, to systematically assess MLLMs' long-context adaptation capacity and their ability to complete tasks in long-context scenarios. Our experimental results, obtained from testing 22 models, revealed that while the closed-source GPT-4o outperforms others, most open-source MLLMs struggle in long-context situations. Interestingly, the performance gap tends to widen with an increase in the number of images. We strongly encourage an intensification of research efforts towards enhancing MLLMs' long-context capabilities, especially in scenarios involving multiple images.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18532v2,2024-04
GPT-4 passes most of the 297 written Polish Board Certification Examinations,"Jakub Pokrywka, Jeremi Kaczmarek, Edward Gorzelańczyk","Introduction: Recently, the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased rapidly, allowing them to be used in a great number of applications. However, the risks posed by the generation of false information through LLMs significantly limit their applications in sensitive areas such as healthcare, highlighting the necessity for rigorous validations to determine their utility and reliability. To date, no study has extensively compared the performance of LLMs on Polish medical examinations across a broad spectrum of specialties on a very large dataset. Objectives: This study evaluated the performance of three Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models on the Polish Board Certification Exam (Pa\'nstwowy Egzamin Specjalizacyjny, PES) dataset, which consists of 297 tests. Methods: We developed a software program to download and process PES exams and tested the performance of GPT models using OpenAI Application Programming Interface. Results: Our findings reveal that GPT-3.5 did not pass any of the analyzed exams. In contrast, the GPT-4 models demonstrated the capability to pass the majority of the exams evaluated, with the most recent model, gpt-4-0125, successfully passing 222 (75%) of them. The performance of the GPT models varied significantly, displaying excellence in exams related to certain specialties while completely failing others. Conclusions: The significant progress and impressive performance of LLM models hold great promise for the increased application of AI in the field of medicine in Poland. For instance, this advancement could lead to the development of AI-based medical assistants for healthcare professionals, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of medical services.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01589v2,2024-04

Explainability of machine learning approaches in forensic linguistics: a case study in geolinguistic authorship profiling,"Dana Roemling, Yves Scherrer, Aleksandra Miletic","Forensic authorship profiling uses linguistic markers to infer characteristics about an author of a text. This task is paralleled in dialect classification, where a prediction is made about the linguistic variety of a text based on the text itself. While there have been significant advances in recent years in variety classification, forensic linguistics rarely relies on these approaches due to their lack of transparency, among other reasons. In this paper we therefore explore the explainability of machine learning approaches considering the forensic context. We focus on variety classification as a means of geolinguistic profiling of unknown texts based on social media data from the German-speaking area.

We find that the extracted lexical features are indeed representative of their respective varieties and note that the trained models also rely on place names for classifications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18510v2,2024-04
ECC Analyzer: Extract Trading Signal from Earnings Conference Calls using Large Language Model for Stock Performance Prediction,"Yupeng Cao, Zhi Chen, Qingyun Pei, Nathan Jinseok Lee, K. P. Subbalakshmi, Papa Momar Ndiaye","In the realm of financial analytics, leveraging unstructured data, such as earnings conference calls (ECCs), to forecast stock volatility is a critical challenge that has attracted both academics and investors. While previous studies have used multimodal deep learning-based models to obtain a general view of ECCs for volatility predicting, they often fail to capture detailed, complex information. Our research introduces a novel framework: \textbf{ECC Analyzer}, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to extract richer, more predictive content from ECCs to aid the model's prediction performance. We use the pre-trained large models to extract textual and audio features from ECCs and implement a hierarchical information extraction strategy to extract more fine-grained information. This strategy first extracts paragraph-level general information by summarizing the text and then extracts fine-grained focus sentences using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These features are then fused through multimodal feature fusion to perform volatility prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional analytical benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of advanced LLM techniques in financial analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18470v2,2024-04
HFT: Half Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models,"Tingfeng Hui, Zhenyu Zhang, Shuohuan Wang, Weiran Xu, Yu Sun, Hua Wu","Large language models (LLMs) with one or more fine-tuning phases have become a necessary step to unlock various capabilities, enabling LLMs to follow natural language instructions or align with human preferences. However, it carries the risk of catastrophic forgetting during sequential training, the parametric knowledge or the ability learned in previous stages may be overwhelmed by incoming training data. In this paper, we find that by regularly resetting partial parameters, LLMs can restore some of the original knowledge. Inspired by this, we introduce Half Fine-Tuning (HFT) for LLMs, as a substitute for full fine-tuning (FFT), to mitigate the forgetting issues, where half of the parameters are selected to learn new tasks while the other half are frozen to remain previous knowledge. We provide a feasibility analysis from the perspective of optimization and interpret the parameter selection operation as a regularization term. Without changing the model architecture, HFT could be seamlessly integrated into existing fine-tuning frameworks. Extensive experiments and analysis on supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and continual learning consistently demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of HFT. Compared with FFT, HFT not only significantly alleviates the forgetting problem, but also achieves the best performance in a series of downstream benchmarks, with an approximately 30% reduction in training time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18466v1,2024-04

Ethical Reasoning and Moral Value Alignment of LLMs Depend on the Language we Prompt them in,"Utkarsh Agarwal, Kumar Tanmay, Aditi Khandelwal, Monojit Choudhury","Ethical reasoning is a crucial skill for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, moral values are not universal, but rather influenced by language and culture. This paper explores how three prominent LLMs -- GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Llama2-70B-Chat -- perform ethical reasoning in different languages and if their moral judgement depend on the language in which they are prompted. We extend the study of ethical reasoning of LLMs by Rao et al. (2023) to a multilingual setup following their framework of probing LLMs with ethical dilemmas and policies from three branches of normative ethics: deontology, virtue, and consequentialism. We experiment with six languages: English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Hindi, and Swahili. We find that GPT-4 is the most consistent and unbiased ethical reasoner across languages, while ChatGPT and Llama2-70B-Chat show significant moral value bias when we move to languages other than English. Interestingly, the nature of this bias significantly vary across languages for all LLMs, including GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18460v1,2024-04

Gemini models, with strong general capabilities in multimodal and long-context reasoning, offer exciting possibilities in medicine. Building on these core strengths of Gemini, we introduce Med-Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models that are specialized in medicine with the ability to seamlessly use web search, and that can be efficiently tailored to novel modalities using custom encoders. We evaluate Med-Gemini on 14 medical benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on 10 of them, and surpass the GPT-4 model family on every benchmark where a direct comparison is viable, often by a wide margin. On the popular MedQA (USMLE) benchmark, our best-performing Med-Gemini model achieves SoTA performance of 91.1% accuracy, using a novel uncertainty-guided search strategy. On 7 multimodal benchmarks including NEJM Image Challenges and MMMU (health & medicine), Med-Gemini improves over GPT-4V by an average relative margin of 44.5%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-Gemini's long-context capabilities through SoTA performance on a needle-in-a-haystack retrieval task from long de-identified health records and medical video question answering, surpassing prior bespoke methods using only in-context learning. Finally, Med-Gemini's performance suggests real-world utility by surpassing human experts on tasks such as medical text summarization, alongside demonstrations of promising potential for multimodal medical dialogue, medical research and education.

Mixture-of-Instructions: Comprehensive Alignment of a Large Language Model through the Mixture of Diverse System Prompting Instructions,"Bowen Xu, Shaoyu Wu, Kai Liu, Lulu Hu","With the proliferation of large language models (LLMs), the comprehensive alignment of such models across multiple tasks has emerged as a critical area of research. Existing alignment methodologies primarily address single task, such as multi-turn dialogue, coding, mathematical problem-solving, and tool usage. However, AI-driven products that leverage language models usually necessitate a fusion of these abilities to function effectively in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the considerable computational resources required for proper alignment of LLMs underscore the need for a more robust, efficient, and encompassing approach to multi-task alignment, ensuring improved generative performance. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel technique termed Mixture-of-Instructions (MoI), which employs a strategy of instruction concatenation combined with diverse system prompts to boost the alignment efficiency of language models. We have also compiled a diverse set of seven benchmark datasets to rigorously evaluate the alignment efficacy of the MoI-enhanced language model. Our methodology was applied to the open-source Qwen-7B-chat model, culminating in the development of Qwen-SFT-MoI. This enhanced model demonstrates significant advancements in generative capabilities across coding, mathematics, and tool use tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18410v1,2024-04
LLM-SR: Scientific Equation Discovery via Programming with Large Language Models,"Parshin Shojaee, Kazem Meidani, Shashank Gupta, Amir Barati Farimani, Chandan K Reddy","Mathematical equations have been unreasonably effective in describing complex natural phenomena across various scientific disciplines. However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely high-dimensional combinatorial and nonlinear hypothesis spaces. Traditional methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the rich domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data in an efficient manner. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its physical understanding, which are then optimized against data to estimate skeleton parameters. We demonstrate LLM-SR's effectiveness across three diverse scientific domains, where it discovers physically accurate equations that provide significantly better fits to in-domain and out-of-domain data compared to the well-established symbolic regression baselines. Incorporating scientific prior knowledge also enables LLM-SR to search the equation space more efficiently than baselines.

"MM-TTS: A Unified Framework for Multimodal, Prompt-Induced Emotional Text-to-Speech Synthesis","Xiang Li, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Jun-Yan He, Xiaojiang Peng, Alexander G. Hauptmann","Emotional Text-to-Speech (E-TTS) synthesis has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance human-computer interaction. However, current E-TTS approaches often struggle to capture the complexity of human emotions, primarily relying on oversimplified emotional labels or single-modality inputs. To address these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Emotional Text-to-Speech System (MM-TTS), a unified framework that leverages emotional cues from multiple modalities to generate highly expressive and emotionally resonant speech. MM-TTS consists of two key components: (1) the Emotion Prompt Alignment Module (EP-Align), which employs contrastive learning to align emotional features across text, audio, and visual modalities, ensuring a coherent fusion of multimodal information; and (2) the Emotion Embedding-Induced TTS (EMI-TTS), which integrates the aligned emotional embeddings with state-of-the-art TTS models to synthesize speech that accurately reflects the intended emotions. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MM-TTS compared to traditional E-TTS models. Objective metrics, including Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER), show significant improvements on ESD dataset, with MM-TTS achieving scores of 7.35% and 3.07%, respectively. Subjective assessments further validate that MM-TTS generates speech with emotional fidelity and naturalness comparable to human speech.

Exploring the Limits of Fine-grained LLM-based Physics Inference via Premise Removal Interventions,"Jordan Meadows, Tamsin James, Andre Freitas","Language models (LMs) can hallucinate when performing complex mathematical reasoning. Physics provides a rich domain for assessing their mathematical capabilities, where physical context requires that any symbolic manipulation satisfies complex semantics (\textit{e.g.,} units, tensorial order). In this work, we systematically remove crucial context from prompts to force instances where model inference may be algebraically coherent, yet unphysical. We assess LM capabilities in this domain using a curated dataset encompassing multiple notations and Physics subdomains. Further, we improve zero-shot scores using synthetic in-context examples, and demonstrate non-linear degradation of derivation quality with perturbation strength via the progressive omission of supporting premises. We find that the models' mathematical reasoning is not physics-informed in this setting, where physical context is predominantly ignored in favour of reverse-engineering solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18384v2,2024-04
Towards Unbiased Evaluation of Detecting Unanswerable Questions in EHRSQL,"Yongjin Yang, Sihyeon Kim, SangMook Kim, Gyubok Lee, Se-Young Yun, Edward Choi","Incorporating unanswerable questions into EHR QA systems is crucial for testing the trustworthiness of a system, as providing non-existent responses can mislead doctors in their diagnoses. The EHRSQL dataset stands out as a promising benchmark because it is the only dataset that incorporates unanswerable questions in the EHR QA system alongside practical questions. However, in this work, we identify a data bias in these unanswerable questions; they can often be discerned simply by filtering with specific N-gram patterns. Such biases jeopardize the authenticity and reliability of QA system evaluations. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple debiasing method of adjusting the split between the validation and test sets to neutralize the undue influence of N-gram filtering. By experimenting on the MIMIC-III dataset, we demonstrate both the existing data bias in EHRSQL and the effectiveness of our data split strategy in mitigating this bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01588v1,2024-04

We propose ""Question-Answering Network Analysis"" (QANA), a novel opinion mining framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate questions from users' comments, constructs a bipartite graph based on the comments' answerability to the questions, and applies centrality measures to examine the importance of opinions. We investigate the impact of question generation styles, LLM selections, and the choice of embedding model on the quality of the constructed QA networks by comparing them with annotated Key Point Analysis datasets. QANA achieves comparable performance to previous state-of-the-art supervised models in a zero-shot manner for Key Point Matching task, also reducing the computational cost from quadratic to linear. For Key Point Generation, questions with high PageRank or degree centrality align well with manually annotated key points. Notably, QANA enables analysts to assess the importance of key points from various aspects according to their selection of centrality measure. QANA's primary contribution lies in its flexibility to extract key points from a wide range of perspectives, which enhances the quality and impartiality of opinion mining.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18371v1,2024-04

In the wake of AI's expansive integration across sectors, addressing racial bias in LLMs has never been more critical. This paper introduces a novel framework called Comprehensive Bias Neutralization Framework (CBNF) which embodies an innovative approach to quantifying and mitigating biases within LLMs. Our framework combines the Large Language Model Bias Index (LLMBI) [Oketunji, A., Anas, M., Saina, D., (2023)] and Bias removaL with No Demographics (BLIND) [Orgad, H., Belinkov, Y.

Parameter-Efficient Tuning Large Language Models for Graph Representation Learning,"Qi Zhu, Da Zheng, Xiang Song, Shichang Zhang, Bowen Jin, Yizhou Sun, George Karypis","Text-rich graphs, which exhibit rich textual information on nodes and edges, are prevalent across a wide range of real-world business applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations.

Modeling Orthographic Variation Improves NLP Performance for Nigerian Pidgin,"Pin-Jie Lin, Merel Scholman, Muhammed Saeed, Vera Demberg","Nigerian Pidgin is an English-derived contact language and is traditionally an oral language, spoken by approximately 100 million people. No orthographic standard has yet been adopted, and thus the few available Pidgin datasets that exist are characterised by noise in the form of orthographic variations. This contributes to under-performance of models in critical NLP tasks. The current work is the first to describe various types of orthographic variations commonly found in Nigerian Pidgin texts, and model this orthographic variation. The variations identified in the dataset form the basis of a phonetic-theoretic framework for word editing, which is used to generate orthographic variations to augment training data. We test the effect of this data augmentation on two critical NLP tasks: machine translation and sentiment analysis. The proposed variation generation framework augments the training data with new orthographic variants which are relevant for the test set but did not occur in the training set originally. Our results demonstrate the positive effect of augmenting the training data with a combination of real texts from other corpora as well as synthesized orthographic variation, resulting in performance improvements of 2.1 points in sentiment analysis and 1.4 BLEU points in translation to English.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18264v1,2024-04
Mapping 'when'-clauses in Latin American and Caribbean languages: an experiment in subtoken-based typology,Nilo Pedrazzini,"Languages can encode temporal subordination lexically, via subordinating conjunctions, and morphologically, by marking the relation on the predicate. Systematic cross-linguistic variation among the former can be studied using well-established token-based typological approaches to token-aligned parallel corpora. Variation among different morphological means is instead much harder to tackle and therefore more poorly understood, despite being predominant in several language groups. This paper explores variation in the expression of generic temporal subordination ('when'-clauses) among the languages of Latin America and the Caribbean, where morphological marking is particularly common. It presents probabilistic semantic maps computed on the basis of the languages of the region, thus avoiding bias towards the many world's languages that exclusively use lexified connectors, incorporating associations between character $n$-grams and English $when$. The approach allows capturing morphological clause-linkage devices in addition to lexified connectors, paving the way for larger-scale, strategy-agnostic analyses of typological variation in temporal subordination.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18257v1,2024-04

In this work, we shed light on the significance of optimizer selection in LLM unlearning for the first time, establishing a clear connection between second-order optimization and influence unlearning (a classical approach using influence functions to update the model for data influence removal). This insight propels us to develop a second-order optimization-based LLM unlearning framework, termed Second-Order UnLearning (SOUL), which extends the static, one-shot model update using influence unlearning to a dynamic, iterative unlearning process. Our extensive experiments show that SOUL consistently outperforms conventional first-order methods across various unlearning tasks, models, and metrics, indicating that second-order optimization offers an effective and broadly applicable solution for LLM unlearning.

From Persona to Personalization: A Survey on Role-Playing Language Agents,"Jiangjie Chen, Xintao Wang, Rui Xu, Siyu Yuan, Yikai Zhang, Wei Shi, Jian Xie, Shuang Li, Ruihan Yang, Tinghui Zhu, Aili Chen, Nianqi Li, Lida Chen, Caiyu Hu, Siye Wu, Scott Ren, Ziquan Fu, Yanghua Xiao","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted the rise of Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs), i.e., specialized AI systems designed to simulate assigned personas. By harnessing multiple advanced abilities of LLMs, including in-context learning, instruction following, and social intelligence, RPLAs achieve a remarkable sense of human likeness and vivid role-playing performance. RPLAs can mimic a wide range of personas, ranging from historical figures and fictional characters to real-life individuals. Consequently, they have catalyzed numerous AI applications, such as emotional companions, interactive video games, personalized assistants and copilots, and digital clones. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the evolution and recent progress in RPLAs integrating with cutting-edge LLM technologies. We categorize personas into three types: 1) Demographic Persona, which leverages statistical stereotypes; 2) Character Persona, focused on well-established figures; and 3) Individualized Persona, customized through ongoing user interactions for personalized services. We begin by presenting a comprehensive overview of current methodologies for RPLAs, followed by the details for each persona type, covering corresponding data sourcing, agent construction, and evaluation. Afterward, we discuss the fundamental risks, existing limitations, and future prospects of RPLAs. Additionally, we provide a brief review of RPLAs in AI applications, which reflects practical user demands that shape and drive RPLA research. Through this work, we aim to establish a clear taxonomy of RPLA research and applications, and facilitate future research in this critical and ever-evolving field, and pave the way for a future where humans and RPLAs coexist in harmony.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18231v2,2024-04
TextGram: Towards a better domain-adaptive pretraining,"Sharayu Hiwarkhedkar, Saloni Mittal, Vidula Magdum, Omkar Dhekane, Raviraj Joshi, Geetanjali Kale, Arnav Ladkat","For green AI, it is crucial to measure and reduce the carbon footprint emitted during the training of large language models. In NLP, performing pre-training on Transformer models requires significant computational resources. This pre-training involves using a large amount of text data to gain prior knowledge for performing downstream tasks. Thus, it is important that we select the correct data in the form of domain-specific data from this vast corpus to achieve optimum results aligned with our domain-specific tasks. While training on large unsupervised data is expensive, it can be optimized by performing a data selection step before pretraining. Selecting important data reduces the space overhead and the substantial amount of time required to pre-train the model while maintaining constant accuracy. We investigate the existing selection strategies and propose our own domain-adaptive data selection method - TextGram - that effectively selects essential data from large corpora. We compare and evaluate the results of finetuned models for text classification task with and without data selection. We show that the proposed strategy works better compared to other selection methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18228v1,2024-04
L3Cube-MahaNews: News-based Short Text and Long Document Classification Datasets in Marathi,"Saloni Mittal, Vidula Magdum, Omkar Dhekane, Sharayu Hiwarkhedkar, Raviraj Joshi","The availability of text or topic classification datasets in the low-resource Marathi language is limited, typically consisting of fewer than 4 target labels, with some achieving nearly perfect accuracy. In this work, we introduce L3Cube-MahaNews, a Marathi text classification corpus that focuses on News headlines and articles. This corpus stands out as the largest supervised Marathi Corpus, containing over 1.05L records classified into a diverse range of 12 categories. To accommodate different document lengths, MahaNews comprises three supervised datasets specifically designed for short text, long documents, and medium paragraphs. The consistent labeling across these datasets facilitates document length-based analysis. We provide detailed data statistics and baseline results on these datasets using state-of-the-art pre-trained BERT models. We conduct a comparative analysis between monolingual and multilingual BERT models, including MahaBERT, IndicBERT, and MuRIL. The monolingual MahaBERT model outperforms all others on every dataset.

Tabular Embedding Model (TEM): Finetuning Embedding Models For Tabular RAG Applications,"Sujit Khanna, Shishir Subedi","In recent times Large Language Models have exhibited tremendous capabilities, especially in the areas of mathematics, code generation and general-purpose reasoning. However for specialized domains especially in applications that require parsing and analyzing large chunks of numeric or tabular data even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to solving domain-specific tabular data analysis tasks by presenting a unique RAG workflow that mitigates the scalability issues of existing tabular LLM solutions. Specifically, we present Tabular Embedding Model (TEM), a novel approach to fine-tune embedding models for tabular Retrieval-Augmentation Generation (RAG) applications. Embedding models form a crucial component in the RAG workflow and even current SOTA embedding models struggle as they are predominantly trained on textual datasets and thus underperform in scenarios involving complex tabular data. The evaluation results showcase that our approach not only outperforms current SOTA embedding models in this domain but also does so with a notably smaller and more efficient model structure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01585v1,2024-04
Learnable Linguistic Watermarks for Tracing Model Extraction Attacks on Large Language Models,"Minhao Bai, Kaiyi Pang, Yongfeng Huang","In the rapidly evolving domain of artificial intelligence, safeguarding the intellectual property of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly crucial. Current watermarking techniques against model extraction attacks, which rely on signal insertion in model logits or post-processing of generated text, remain largely heuristic. We propose a novel method for embedding learnable linguistic watermarks in LLMs, aimed at tracing and preventing model extraction attacks. Our approach subtly modifies the LLM's output distribution by introducing controlled noise into token frequency distributions, embedding an statistically identifiable controllable watermark.We leverage statistical hypothesis testing and information theory, particularly focusing on Kullback-Leibler Divergence, to differentiate between original and modified distributions effectively. Our watermarking method strikes a delicate well balance between robustness and output quality, maintaining low false positive/negative rates and preserving the LLM's original performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01509v1,2024-04
Exploring the Robustness of In-Context Learning with Noisy Labels,"Chen Cheng, Xinzhi Yu, Haodong Wen, Jingsong Sun, Guanzhang Yue, Yihao Zhang, Zeming Wei","Recently, the mysterious In-Context Learning (ICL) ability exhibited by Transformer architectures, especially in large language models (LLMs), has sparked significant research interest. However, the resilience of Transformers' in-context learning capabilities in the presence of noisy samples, prevalent in both training corpora and prompt demonstrations, remains underexplored. In this paper, inspired by prior research that studies ICL ability using simple function classes, we take a closer look at this problem by investigating the robustness of Transformers against noisy labels. Specifically, we first conduct a thorough evaluation and analysis of the robustness of Transformers against noisy labels during in-context learning and show that they exhibit notable resilience against diverse types of noise in demonstration labels. Furthermore, we delve deeper into this problem by exploring whether introducing noise into the training set, akin to a form of data augmentation, enhances such robustness during inference, and find that such noise can indeed improve the robustness of ICL. Overall, our fruitful analysis and findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the resilience of Transformer models against label noises during ICL and provide valuable insights into the research on Transformers in natural language processing.

Ranked List Truncation for Large Language Model-based Re-Ranking,"Chuan Meng, Negar Arabzadeh, Arian Askari, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Maarten de Rijke","We study ranked list truncation (RLT) from a novel ""retrieve-then-re-rank"" perspective, where we optimize re-ranking by truncating the retrieved list (i.e., trim re-ranking candidates). RLT is crucial for re-ranking as it can improve re-ranking efficiency by sending variable-length candidate lists to a re-ranker on a per-query basis. It also has the potential to improve re-ranking effectiveness. Despite its importance, there is limited research into applying RLT methods to this new perspective. To address this research gap, we reproduce existing RLT methods in the context of re-ranking, especially newly emerged large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking. In particular, we examine to what extent established findings on RLT for retrieval are generalizable to the ""retrieve-then-re-rank"" setup from three perspectives: (i) assessing RLT methods in the context of LLM-based re-ranking with lexical first-stage retrieval, (ii) investigating the impact of different types of first-stage retrievers on RLT methods, and (iii) investigating the impact of different types of re-rankers on RLT methods. We perform experiments on the TREC 2019 and 2020 deep learning tracks, investigating 8 RLT methods for pipelines involving 3 retrievers and 2 re-rankers. We reach new insights into RLT methods in the context of re-ranking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18185v1,2024-04

Alabi, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Firdous Damilola Bakare, Oluwatoyin Bunmi Abiola, Oluwaseyi Adesina Adeyemo","Nigerians have a notable online presence and actively discuss political and topical matters. This was particularly evident throughout the 2023 general election, where Twitter was used for campaigning, fact-checking and verification, and even positive and negative discourse. However, little or none has been done in the detection of abusive language and hate speech in Nigeria. In this paper, we curated code-switched Twitter data directed at three musketeers of the governorship election on the most populous and economically vibrant state in Nigeria; Lagos state, with the view to detect offensive speech in political discussions. We developed EkoHate -- an abusive language and hate speech dataset for political discussions between the three candidates and their followers using a binary (normal vs offensive) and fine-grained four-label annotation scheme. We analysed our dataset and provided an empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art methods across both supervised and cross-lingual transfer learning settings. In the supervised setting, our evaluation results in both binary and four-label annotation schemes show that we can achieve 95.1 and 70.3 F1 points respectively. Furthermore, we show that our dataset adequately transfers very well to three publicly available offensive datasets (OLID, HateUS2020, and FountaHate), generalizing to political discussions in other regions like the US.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18180v1,2024-04
Explaining vague language,"Paul Égré, Benjamin Spector","Why is language vague? Vagueness may be explained and rationalized if it can be shown that vague language is more useful to speaker and hearer than precise language. In a well-known paper, Lipman proposes a game-theoretic account of vagueness in terms of mixed strategy that leads to a puzzle: vagueness cannot be strictly better than precision at equilibrium. More recently, \'Egr\'e, Spector, Mortier and Verheyen have put forward a Bayesian account of vagueness establishing that using vague words can be strictly more informative than using precise words. This paper proposes to compare both results and to explain why they are not in contradiction. Lipman's definition of vagueness relies exclusively on a property of signaling strategies, without making any assumptions about the lexicon, whereas \'Egr\'e et al.'s involves a layer of semantic content. We argue that the semantic account of vagueness is needed, and more adequate and explanatory of vagueness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18154v1,2024-04
Lightweight Conceptual Dictionary Learning for Text Classification Using Information Compression,"Li Wan, Tansu Alpcan, Margreta Kuijper, Emanuele Viterbo","We propose a novel, lightweight supervised dictionary learning framework for text classification based on data compression and representation. This two-phase algorithm initially employs the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm to construct a dictionary from text datasets, focusing on the conceptual significance of dictionary elements. Subsequently, dictionaries are refined considering label data, optimizing dictionary atoms to enhance discriminative power based on mutual information and class distribution. This process generates discriminative numerical representations, facilitating the training of simple classifiers such as SVMs and neural networks. We evaluate our algorithm's information-theoretic performance using information bottleneck principles and introduce the information plane area rank (IPAR) as a novel metric to quantify the information-theoretic performance. Tested on six benchmark text datasets, our algorithm competes closely with top models, especially in limited-vocabulary contexts, using significantly fewer parameters. \review{Our algorithm closely matches top-performing models, deviating by only ~2\% on limited-vocabulary datasets, using just 10\% of their parameters. However, it falls short on diverse-vocabulary datasets, likely due to the LZW algorithm's constraints with low-repetition data. This contrast highlights its efficiency and limitations across different dataset types.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01584v1,2024-04
Logic Agent: Enhancing Validity with Logic Rule Invocation,"Hanmeng Liu, Zhiyang Teng, Chaoli Zhang, Yue Zhang","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a pivotal technique for augmenting the inferential capabilities of language models during reasoning tasks. Despite its advancements, CoT often grapples with challenges in validating reasoning validity and ensuring informativeness. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces the Logic Agent (LA), an agent-based framework aimed at enhancing the validity of reasoning processes in Large Language Models (LLMs) through strategic logic rule invocation. Unlike conventional approaches, LA transforms LLMs into logic agents that dynamically apply propositional logic rules, initiating the reasoning process by converting natural language inputs into structured logic forms. The logic agent leverages a comprehensive set of predefined functions to systematically navigate the reasoning process. This methodology not only promotes the structured and coherent generation of reasoning constructs but also significantly improves their interpretability and logical coherence. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate LA's capacity to scale effectively across various model sizes, markedly improving the precision of complex reasoning across diverse tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18130v2,2024-04
USAT: A Universal Speaker-Adaptive Text-to-Speech Approach,"Wenbin Wang, Yang Song, Sanjay Jha","Conventional text-to-speech (TTS) research has predominantly focused on enhancing the quality of synthesized speech for speakers in the training dataset. The challenge of synthesizing lifelike speech for unseen, out-of-dataset speakers, especially those with limited reference data, remains a significant and unresolved problem. While zero-shot or few-shot speaker-adaptive TTS approaches have been explored, they have many limitations. Zero-shot approaches tend to suffer from insufficient generalization performance to reproduce the voice of speakers with heavy accents. While few-shot methods can reproduce highly varying accents, they bring a significant storage burden and the risk of overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. In addition, prior approaches only provide either zero-shot or few-shot adaptation, constraining their utility across varied real-world scenarios with different demands. Besides, most current evaluations of speaker-adaptive TTS are conducted only on datasets of native speakers, inadvertently neglecting a vast portion of non-native speakers with diverse accents. Our proposed framework unifies both zero-shot and few-shot speaker adaptation strategies, which we term as ""instant"" and ""fine-grained"" adaptations based on their merits. To alleviate the insufficient generalization performance observed in zero-shot speaker adaptation, we designed two innovative discriminators and introduced a memory mechanism for the speech decoder. To prevent catastrophic forgetting and reduce storage implications for few-shot speaker adaptation, we designed two adapters and a unique adaptation procedure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18094v1,2024-04
CRE-LLM: A Domain-Specific Chinese Relation Extraction Framework with Fine-tuned Large Language Model,"Zhengpeng Shi, Haoran Luo","Domain-Specific Chinese Relation Extraction (DSCRE) aims to extract relations between entities from domain-specific Chinese text. Despite the rapid development of PLMs in recent years, especially LLMs, DSCRE still faces three core challenges: complex network structure design, poor awareness, and high consumption of fine-tuning. Given the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, we propose a new framework called CRE-LLM. This framework is based on fine-tuning open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, ChatGLM2, and Baichuan2. CRE-LLM enhances the logic-awareness and generative capabilities of the model by constructing an appropriate prompt and utilizing open-source LLMs for instruction-supervised fine-tuning. And then it directly extracts the relations of the given entities in the input textual data, which improving the CRE approach. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on two domain-specific CRE datasets, FinRE and SanWen. The experimental results show that CRE-LLM is significantly superior and robust, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the FinRE dataset. This paper introduces a novel approach to domain-specific relation extraction (DSCRE) tasks that are semantically more complex by combining LLMs with triples.

To further explore and enhance LLMs' potential in music composition by leveraging their reasoning ability and the large knowledge base in music history and theory, we propose ComposerX, an agent-based symbolic music generation framework. We find that applying a multi-agent approach significantly improves the music composition quality of GPT-4.

Further, the probabilistic error rules are extracted from the corpus in an unsupervised way to model the tendency of error happening(error model). Then the combination of LM and error model is used to develop the SC model through the well-known noisy channel framework.

Can Perplexity Predict Fine-Tuning Performance? An Investigation of Tokenization Effects on Sequential Language Models for Nepali,"Nishant Luitel, Nirajan Bekoju, Anand Kumar Sah, Subarna Shakya","Recent language models use subwording mechanisms to handle Out-of-Vocabulary(OOV) words seen during test time and, their generation capacity is generally measured using perplexity, an intrinsic metric. It is known that increasing the subword granularity results in a decrease of perplexity value. However, the study of how subwording affects the understanding capacity of language models has been very few and only limited to a handful of languages. To reduce this gap we used 6 different tokenization schemes to pretrain relatively small language models in Nepali and used the representations learned to finetune on several downstream tasks. Although byte-level BPE algorithm has been used in recent models like GPT, RoBERTa we show that on average they are sub-optimal in comparison to algorithms such as SentencePiece in finetuning performances for Nepali.

Both Node-wise Graph Neural Network (NGNN) and Hypergraph Neural Network aim to score a set of items according to the outfit compatibility of items. The data used is the Polyvore Dataset which consists of curated outfits with product images and text descriptions for each product in an outfit.

Leveraging Prompts in LLMs to Overcome Imbalances in Complex Educational Text Data,"Jeanne McClure, Machi Shimmei, Noboru Matsuda, Shiyan Jiang","In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) with assertions to mitigate imbalances in educational datasets. Traditional models often fall short in such contexts, particularly due to the complexity and nuanced nature of the data. This issue is especially prominent in the education sector, where cognitive engagement levels among students show significant variation in their open responses. To test our hypothesis, we utilized an existing technology for assertion-based prompt engineering through an 'Iterative - ICL PE Design Process' comparing traditional Machine Learning (ML) models against LLMs augmented with assertions (N=135). Further, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on a subset (n=27), examining the variance in model performance concerning classification metrics and cognitive engagement levels in each iteration. Our findings reveal that LLMs with assertions significantly outperform traditional ML models, particularly in cognitive engagement levels with minority representation, registering up to a 32% increase in F1-score. Additionally, our sensitivity study indicates that incorporating targeted assertions into the LLM tested on the subset enhances its performance by 11.94%.

Quality Estimation with $k$-nearest Neighbors and Automatic Evaluation for Model-specific Quality Estimation,"Tu Anh Dinh, Tobias Palzer, Jan Niehues","Providing quality scores along with Machine Translation (MT) output, so-called reference-free Quality Estimation (QE), is crucial to inform users about the reliability of the translation. We propose a model-specific, unsupervised QE approach, termed $k$NN-QE, that extracts information from the MT model's training data using $k$-nearest neighbors. Measuring the performance of model-specific QE is not straightforward, since they provide quality scores on their own MT output, thus cannot be evaluated using benchmark QE test sets containing human quality scores on premade MT output. Therefore, we propose an automatic evaluation method that uses quality scores from reference-based metrics as gold standard instead of human-generated ones.

Enhancing Pre-Trained Generative Language Models with Question Attended Span Extraction on Machine Reading Comprehension,"Lin Ai, Zheng Hui, Zizhou Liu, Julia Hirschberg","Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) poses a significant challenge in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). While mainstream MRC methods predominantly leverage extractive strategies using encoder-only models such as BERT, generative approaches face the issue of out-of-control generation -- a critical problem where answers generated are often incorrect, irrelevant, or unfaithful to the source text. To address these limitations in generative models for MRC, we introduce the Question-Attended Span Extraction (QASE) module. Integrated during the fine-tuning phase of pre-trained generative language models (PLMs), QASE significantly enhances their performance, allowing them to surpass the extractive capabilities of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 in few-shot settings. Notably, these gains in performance do not come with an increase in computational demands. The efficacy of the QASE module has been rigorously tested across various datasets, consistently achieving or even surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, thereby bridging the gap between generative and extractive models in extractive MRC tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17991v3,2024-04
Detection of Conspiracy Theories Beyond Keyword Bias in German-Language Telegram Using Large Language Models,"Milena Pustet, Elisabeth Steffen, Helena Mihaljević","The automated detection of conspiracy theories online typically relies on supervised learning. However, creating respective training data requires expertise, time and mental resilience, given the often harmful content. Moreover, available datasets are predominantly in English and often keyword-based, introducing a token-level bias into the models. Our work addresses the task of detecting conspiracy theories in German Telegram messages. We compare the performance of supervised fine-tuning approaches using BERT-like models with prompt-based approaches using Llama2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 which require little or no additional training data. We use a dataset of $\sim\!\! 4,000$ messages collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, without the use of keyword filters.   Our findings demonstrate that both approaches can be leveraged effectively: For supervised fine-tuning, we report an F1 score of $\sim\!\! 0.8$ for the positive class, making our model comparable to recent models trained on keyword-focused English corpora. We demonstrate our model's adaptability to intra-domain temporal shifts, achieving F1 scores of $\sim\!\! 0.7$.

TI-ASU: Toward Robust Automatic Speech Understanding through Text-to-speech Imputation Against Missing Speech Modality,"Tiantian Feng, Xuan Shi, Rahul Gupta, Shrikanth S. Narayanan","Automatic Speech Understanding (ASU) aims at human-like speech interpretation, providing nuanced intent, emotion, sentiment, and content understanding from speech and language (text) content conveyed in speech. Typically, training a robust ASU model relies heavily on acquiring large-scale, high-quality speech and associated transcriptions. However, it is often challenging to collect or use speech data for training ASU due to concerns such as privacy. To approach this setting of enabling ASU when speech (audio) modality is missing, we propose TI-ASU, using a pre-trained text-to-speech model to impute the missing speech. We report extensive experiments evaluating TI-ASU on various missing scales, both multi- and single-modality settings, and the use of LLMs. Our findings show that TI-ASU yields substantial benefits to improve ASU in scenarios where even up to 95% of training speech is missing. Moreover, we show that TI-ASU is adaptive to dropout training, improving model robustness in addressing missing speech during inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17983v1,2024-04
Automating Customer Needs Analysis: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models in the Travel Industry,"Simone Barandoni, Filippo Chiarello, Lorenzo Cascone, Emiliano Marrale, Salvatore Puccio","In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many tasks, such as extracting valuable insights from vast amounts of textual data. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of LLMs for the extraction of travel customer needs from TripAdvisor posts. Leveraging a diverse range of models, including both open-source and proprietary ones such as GPT-4 and Gemini, we aim to elucidate their strengths and weaknesses in this specialized domain. Through an evaluation process involving metrics such as BERTScore, ROUGE, and BLEU, we assess the performance of each model in accurately identifying and summarizing customer needs. Our findings highlight the efficacy of opensource LLMs, particularly Mistral 7B, in achieving comparable performance to larger closed models while offering affordability and customization benefits. Additionally, we underscore the importance of considering factors such as model size, resource requirements, and performance metrics when selecting the most suitable LLM for customer needs analysis tasks. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights for businesses seeking to leverage advanced NLP techniques to enhance customer experience and drive operational efficiency in the travel industry.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17975v1,2024-04
Usefulness of Emotional Prosody in Neural Machine Translation,"Charles Brazier, Jean-Luc Rouas","Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is the task of translating a text from one language to another with the use of a trained neural network. Several existing works aim at incorporating external information into NMT models to improve or control predicted translations (e.g. sentiment, politeness, gender). In this work, we propose to improve translation quality by adding another external source of information: the automatically recognized emotion in the voice. This work is motivated by the assumption that each emotion is associated with a specific lexicon that can overlap between emotions. Our proposed method follows a two-stage procedure. At first, we select a state-of-the-art Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model to predict dimensional emotion values from all input audio in the dataset. Then, we use these predicted emotions as source tokens added at the beginning of input texts to train our NMT model. We show that integrating emotion information, especially arousal, into NMT systems leads to better translations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17968v1,2024-04
Transfer Learning Enhanced Single-choice Decision for Multi-choice Question Answering,"Chenhao Cui, Yufan Jiang, Shuangzhi Wu, Zhoujun Li","Multi-choice Machine Reading Comprehension (MMRC) aims to select the correct answer from a set of options based on a given passage and question. The existing methods employ the pre-trained language model as the encoder, share and transfer knowledge through fine-tuning.These methods mainly focus on the design of exquisite mechanisms to effectively capture the relationships among the triplet of passage, question and answers. It is non-trivial but ignored to transfer knowledge from other MRC tasks such as SQuAD due to task specific of MMRC.In this paper, we reconstruct multi-choice to single-choice by training a binary classification to distinguish whether a certain answer is correct. Then select the option with the highest confidence score as the final answer. Our proposed method gets rid of the multi-choice framework and can leverage resources of other tasks. We construct our model based on the ALBERT-xxlarge model and evaluate it on the RACE and DREAM datasets. Experimental results show that our model performs better than multi-choice methods. In addition, by transferring knowledge from other kinds of MRC tasks, our model achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and ensemble settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17949v1,2024-04
Spatio-Temporal Side Tuning Pre-trained Foundation Models for Video-based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition,"Xiao Wang, Qian Zhu, Jiandong Jin, Jun Zhu, Futian Wang, Bo Jiang, Yaowei Wang, Yonghong Tian","Existing pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) algorithms are mainly developed based on a static image, however, the performance is unreliable in challenging scenarios, such as heavy occlusion, motion blur, etc. In this work, we propose to understand human attributes using video frames that can fully use temporal information by fine-tuning a pre-trained multi-modal foundation model efficiently. Specifically, we formulate the video-based PAR as a vision-language fusion problem and adopt a pre-trained foundation model CLIP to extract the visual features. More importantly, we propose a novel spatiotemporal side-tuning strategy to achieve parameter-efficient optimization of the pre-trained vision foundation model. To better utilize the semantic information, we take the full attribute list that needs to be recognized as another input and transform the attribute words/phrases into the corresponding sentence via split, expand, and prompt operations. Then, the text encoder of CLIP is utilized for embedding processed attribute descriptions. The averaged visual tokens and text tokens are concatenated and fed into a fusion Transformer for multi-modal interactive learning. The enhanced tokens will be fed into a classification head for pedestrian attribute prediction. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video-based PAR datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

I Have an Attention Bridge to Sell You: Generalization Capabilities of Modular Translation Architectures,"Timothee Mickus, Raúl Vázquez, Joseph Attieh","Modularity is a paradigm of machine translation with the potential of bringing forth models that are large at training time and small during inference. Within this field of study, modular approaches, and in particular attention bridges, have been argued to improve the generalization capabilities of models by fostering language-independent representations. In the present paper, we study whether modularity affects translation quality; as well as how well modular architectures generalize across different evaluation scenarios. For a given computational budget, we find non-modular architectures to be always comparable or preferable to all modular designs we study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17918v2,2024-04
SERPENT-VLM : Self-Refining Radiology Report Generation Using Vision Language Models,"Manav Nitin Kapadnis, Sohan Patnaik, Abhilash Nandy, Sourjyadip Ray, Pawan Goyal, Debdoot Sheet","Radiology Report Generation (R2Gen) demonstrates how Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can automate the creation of accurate and coherent radiological reports. Existing methods often hallucinate details in text-based reports that don't accurately reflect the image content. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel strategy, SERPENT-VLM (SElf Refining Radiology RePort GENeraTion using Vision Language Models), which improves the R2Gen task by integrating a self-refining mechanism into the MLLM framework. We employ a unique self-supervised loss that leverages similarity between pooled image representations and the contextual representations of the generated radiological text, alongside the standard Causal Language Modeling objective, to refine image-text representations. This allows the model to scrutinize and align the generated text through dynamic interaction between a given image and the generated text, therefore reducing hallucination and continuously enhancing nuanced report generation. SERPENT-VLM outperforms existing baselines such as LLaVA-Med, BiomedGPT, etc., achieving SoTA performance on the IU X-ray and Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) datasets, and also proves to be robust against noisy images. A qualitative case study emphasizes the significant advancements towards more sophisticated MLLM frameworks for R2Gen, opening paths for further research into self-supervised refinement in the medical imaging domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17912v2,2024-04
Tool Calling: Enhancing Medication Consultation via Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models,"Zhongzhen Huang, Kui Xue, Yongqi Fan, Linjie Mu, Ruoyu Liu, Tong Ruan, Shaoting Zhang, Xiaofan Zhang","Large-scale language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various language tasks but suffer from hallucinations and temporal misalignment. To mitigate these shortcomings, Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been utilized to provide external knowledge to facilitate the answer generation. However, applying such models to the medical domain faces several challenges due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge and the intricacy of real-world scenarios. In this study, we explore LLMs with RAG framework for knowledge-intensive tasks in the medical field. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs, we introduce MedicineQA, a multi-round dialogue benchmark that simulates the real-world medication consultation scenario and requires LLMs to answer with retrieved evidence from the medicine database. MedicineQA contains 300 multi-round question-answering pairs, each embedded within a detailed dialogue history, highlighting the challenge posed by this knowledge-intensive task to current LLMs. We further propose a new \textit{Distill-Retrieve-Read} framework instead of the previous \textit{Retrieve-then-Read}. Specifically, the distillation and retrieval process utilizes a tool calling mechanism to formulate search queries that emulate the keyword-based inquiries used by search engines. With experimental results, we show that our framework brings notable performance improvements and surpasses the previous counterparts in the evidence retrieval process in terms of evidence retrieval accuracy. This advancement sheds light on applying RAG to the medical domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17897v1,2024-04
PromptCL: Improving Event Representation via Prompt Template and Contrastive Learning,"Yubo Feng, Lishuang Li, Yi Xiang, Xueyang Qin","The representation of events in text plays a significant role in various NLP tasks. Recent research demonstrates that contrastive learning has the ability to improve event comprehension capabilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and enhance the performance of event representation learning. However, the efficacy of event representation learning based on contrastive learning and PLMs is limited by the short length of event texts. The length of event texts differs significantly from the text length used in the pre-training of PLMs. As a result, there is inconsistency in the distribution of text length between pre-training and event representation learning, which may undermine the learning process of event representation based on PLMs. In this study, we present PromptCL, a novel framework for event representation learning that effectively elicits the capabilities of PLMs to comprehensively capture the semantics of short event texts. PromptCL utilizes a Prompt template borrowed from prompt learning to expand the input text during Contrastive Learning. This helps in enhancing the event representation learning by providing a structured outline of the event components. Moreover, we propose Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) word order and Event-oriented Masked Language Modeling (EventMLM) to train PLMs to understand the relationships between event components. Our experimental results demonstrate that PromptCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on event related tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis and demonstrate that using a prompt results in improved generalization capabilities for event representations. Our code will be available at https://github.com/YuboFeng2023/PromptCL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17877v1,2024-04
From Languages to Geographies: Towards Evaluating Cultural Bias in Hate Speech Datasets,"Manuel Tonneau, Diyi Liu, Samuel Fraiberger, Ralph Schroeder, Scott A. Hale, Paul Röttger","Perceptions of hate can vary greatly across cultural contexts. Hate speech (HS) datasets, however, have traditionally been developed by language. This hides potential cultural biases, as one language may be spoken in different countries home to different cultures. In this work, we evaluate cultural bias in HS datasets by leveraging two interrelated cultural proxies: language and geography. We conduct a systematic survey of HS datasets in eight languages and confirm past findings on their English-language bias, but also show that this bias has been steadily decreasing in the past few years. For three geographically-widespread languages -- English, Arabic and Spanish -- we then leverage geographical metadata from tweets to approximate geo-cultural contexts by pairing language and country information. We find that HS datasets for these languages exhibit a strong geo-cultural bias, largely overrepresenting a handful of countries (e.g., US and UK for English) relative to their prominence in both the broader social media population and the general population speaking these languages. Based on these findings, we formulate recommendations for the creation of future HS datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17874v1,2024-04
Revisiting Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation from the Perspective of Graph Spectrum,"Tao Meng, Fuchen Zhang, Yuntao Shou, Wei Ai, Nan Yin, Keqin Li","Efficiently capturing consistent and complementary semantic features in a multimodal conversation context is crucial for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC). Existing methods mainly use graph structures to model dialogue context semantic dependencies and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture multimodal semantic features for emotion recognition. However, these methods are limited by some inherent characteristics of GNN, such as over-smoothing and low-pass filtering, resulting in the inability to learn long-distance consistency information and complementary information efficiently. Since consistency and complementarity information correspond to low-frequency and high-frequency information, respectively, this paper revisits the problem of multimodal emotion recognition in conversation from the perspective of the graph spectrum. Specifically, we propose a Graph-Spectrum-based Multimodal Consistency and Complementary collaborative learning framework GS-MCC. First, GS-MCC uses a sliding window to construct a multimodal interaction graph to model conversational relationships and uses efficient Fourier graph operators to extract long-distance high-frequency and low-frequency information, respectively. Then, GS-MCC uses contrastive learning to construct self-supervised signals that reflect complementarity and consistent semantic collaboration with high and low-frequency signals, thereby improving the ability of high and low-frequency information to reflect real emotions. Finally, GS-MCC inputs the collaborative high and low-frequency information into the MLP network and softmax function for emotion prediction. Extensive experiments have proven the superiority of the GS-MCC architecture proposed in this paper on two benchmark data sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17862v2,2024-04
Revisiting Multi-modal Emotion Learning with Broad State Space Models and Probability-guidance Fusion,"Yuntao Shou, Tao Meng, Fuchen Zhang, Nan Yin, Keqin Li","Multi-modal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) has received considerable attention in various fields, e.g., human-computer interaction and recommendation systems. Most existing works perform feature disentanglement and fusion to extract emotional contextual information from multi-modal features and emotion classification. After revisiting the characteristic of MERC, we argue that long-range contextual semantic information should be extracted in the feature disentanglement stage and the inter-modal semantic information consistency should be maximized in the feature fusion stage. Inspired by recent State Space Models (SSMs), Mamba can efficiently model long-distance dependencies. Therefore, in this work, we fully consider the above insights to further improve the performance of MERC. Specifically, on the one hand, in the feature disentanglement stage, we propose a Broad Mamba, which does not rely on a self-attention mechanism for sequence modeling, but uses state space models to compress emotional representation, and utilizes broad learning systems to explore the potential data distribution in broad space. Different from previous SSMs, we design a bidirectional SSM convolution to extract global context information. On the other hand, we design a multi-modal fusion strategy based on probability guidance to maximize the consistency of information between modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method can overcome the computational and memory limitations of Transformer when modeling long-distance contexts, and has great potential to become a next-generation general architecture in MERC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17858v2,2024-04
Toxicity Classification in Ukrainian,"Daryna Dementieva, Valeriia Khylenko, Nikolay Babakov, Georg Groh","The task of toxicity detection is still a relevant task, especially in the context of safe and fair LMs development. Nevertheless, labeled binary toxicity classification corpora are not available for all languages, which is understandable given the resource-intensive nature of the annotation process. Ukrainian, in particular, is among the languages lacking such resources. To our knowledge, there has been no existing toxicity classification corpus in Ukrainian. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by investigating cross-lingual knowledge transfer techniques and creating labeled corpora by: (i)~translating from an English corpus, (ii)~filtering toxic samples using keywords, and (iii)~annotating with crowdsourcing. We compare LLMs prompting and other cross-lingual transfer approaches with and without fine-tuning offering insights into the most robust and efficient baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17841v1,2024-04
VANER: Leveraging Large Language Model for Versatile and Adaptive Biomedical Named Entity Recognition,"Junyi Biana, Weiqi Zhai, Xiaodi Huang, Jiaxuan Zheng, Shanfeng Zhu","Prevalent solution for BioNER involves using representation learning techniques coupled with sequence labeling. However, such methods are inherently task-specific, demonstrate poor generalizability, and often require dedicated model for each dataset. To leverage the versatile capabilities of recently remarkable large language models (LLMs), several endeavors have explored generative approaches to entity extraction. Yet, these approaches often fall short of the effectiveness of previouly sequence labeling approaches. In this paper, we utilize the open-sourced LLM LLaMA2 as the backbone model, and design specific instructions to distinguish between different types of entities and datasets. By combining the LLM's understanding of instructions with sequence labeling techniques, we use mix of datasets to train a model capable of extracting various types of entities. Given that the backbone LLMs lacks specialized medical knowledge, we also integrate external entity knowledge bases and employ instruction tuning to compel the model to densely recognize carefully curated entities. Our model VANER, trained with a small partition of parameters, significantly outperforms previous LLMs-based models and, for the first time, as a model based on LLM, surpasses the majority of conventional state-of-the-art BioNER systems, achieving the highest F1 scores across three datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17835v1,2024-04
Evaluation of Few-Shot Learning for Classification Tasks in the Polish Language,"Tsimur Hadeliya, Dariusz Kajtoch","We introduce a few-shot benchmark consisting of 7 different classification tasks native to the Polish language. We conducted an empirical comparison with 0 and 16 shots between fine-tuning, linear probing, SetFit, and in-context learning (ICL) using various pre-trained commercial and open-source models. Our findings reveal that ICL achieves the best performance, with commercial models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 attaining the best performance. However, there remains a significant 14 percentage points gap between our best few-shot learning score and the performance of HerBERT-large fine-tuned on the entire training dataset. Among the techniques, SetFit emerges as the second-best approach, closely followed by linear probing. We observed the worst and most unstable performance with non-linear head fine-tuning. Results for ICL indicate that continual pre-training of models like Mistral-7b or Llama-2-13b on Polish corpora is beneficial. This is confirmed by the improved performances of Bielik-7b and Trurl-13b, respectively. To further support experiments in few-shot learning for Polish, we are releasing handcrafted templates for the ICL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17832v1,2024-04
"Recall, Retrieve and Reason: Towards Better In-Context Relation Extraction","Guozheng Li, Peng Wang, Wenjun Ke, Yikai Guo, Ke Ji, Ziyu Shang, Jiajun Liu, Zijie Xu","Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify relations between entities mentioned in texts. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) abilities in various tasks, they still suffer from poor performances compared to most supervised fine-tuned RE methods. Utilizing ICL for RE with LLMs encounters two challenges: (1) retrieving good demonstrations from training examples, and (2) enabling LLMs exhibit strong ICL abilities in RE. On the one hand, retrieving good demonstrations is a non-trivial process in RE, which easily results in low relevance regarding entities and relations. On the other hand, ICL with an LLM achieves poor performance in RE while RE is different from language modeling in nature or the LLM is not large enough. In this work, we propose a novel recall-retrieve-reason RE framework that synergizes LLMs with retrieval corpora (training examples) to enable relevant retrieving and reliable in-context reasoning. Specifically, we distill the consistently ontological knowledge from training datasets to let LLMs generate relevant entity pairs grounded by retrieval corpora as valid queries. These entity pairs are then used to retrieve relevant training examples from the retrieval corpora as demonstrations for LLMs to conduct better ICL via instruction tuning. Extensive experiments on different LLMs and RE datasets demonstrate that our method generates relevant and valid entity pairs and boosts ICL abilities of LLMs, achieving competitive or new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-level RE compared to previous supervised fine-tuning methods and ICL-based methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17809v1,2024-04
Scaffold-BPE: Enhancing Byte Pair Encoding for Large Language Models with Simple and Effective Scaffold Token Removal,"Haoran Lian, Yizhe Xiong, Jianwei Niu, Shasha Mo, Zhenpeng Su, Zijia Lin, Hui Chen, Peng Liu, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding","Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) serves as a foundation method for text tokenization in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. Despite its wide adoption, the original BPE algorithm harbors an inherent flaw: it inadvertently introduces a frequency imbalance for tokens in the text corpus. Since BPE iteratively merges the most frequent token pair in the text corpus to generate a new token and keeps all generated tokens in the vocabulary, it unavoidably holds tokens that primarily act as components of a longer token and appear infrequently on their own. We term such tokens as Scaffold Tokens. Due to their infrequent occurrences in the text corpus, Scaffold Tokens pose a learning imbalance issue. To address that issue, we propose Scaffold-BPE, which incorporates a dynamic scaffold token removal mechanism by parameter-free, computation-light, and easy-to-implement modifications to the original BPE method. This novel approach ensures the exclusion of low-frequency Scaffold Tokens from the token representations for given texts, thereby mitigating the issue of frequency imbalance and facilitating model training. On extensive experiments across language modeling and even machine translation, Scaffold-BPE consistently outperforms the original BPE, well demonstrating its effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17808v3,2024-04
Meta In-Context Learning Makes Large Language Models Better Zero and Few-Shot Relation Extractors,"Guozheng Li, Peng Wang, Jiajun Liu, Yikai Guo, Ke Ji, Ziyu Shang, Zijie Xu","Relation extraction (RE) is an important task that aims to identify the relationships between entities in texts. While large language models (LLMs) have revealed remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capability for general zero and few-shot learning, recent studies indicate that current LLMs still struggle with zero and few-shot RE. Previous studies are mainly dedicated to design prompt formats and select good examples for improving ICL-based RE. Although both factors are vital for ICL, if one can fundamentally boost the ICL capability of LLMs in RE, the zero and few-shot RE performance via ICL would be significantly improved. To this end, we introduce \textsc{Micre} (\textbf{M}eta \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext learning of LLMs for \textbf{R}elation \textbf{E}xtraction), a new meta-training framework for zero and few-shot RE where an LLM is tuned to do ICL on a diverse collection of RE datasets (i.e., learning to learn in context for RE). Through meta-training, the model becomes more effectively to learn a new RE task in context by conditioning on a few training examples with no parameter updates or task-specific templates at inference time, enabling better zero and few-shot task generalization. We experiment \textsc{Micre} on various LLMs with different model scales and 12 public RE datasets, and then evaluate it on unseen RE benchmarks under zero and few-shot settings. \textsc{Micre} delivers comparable or superior performance compared to a range of baselines including supervised fine-tuning and typical in-context learning methods. We find that the gains are particular significant for larger model scales, and using a diverse set of the meta-training RE datasets is key to improvements. Empirically, we show that \textsc{Micre} can transfer the relation semantic knowledge via relation label name during inference on target RE datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17807v1,2024-04

However, current CLAP struggles to capture temporal information within audio and text features, presenting substantial limitations for tasks such as audio retrieval and generation. To address this gap, we introduce T-CLAP, a temporal-enhanced CLAP model. We use Large Language Models~(LLMs) and mixed-up strategies to generate temporal-contrastive captions for audio clips from extensive audio-text datasets. Subsequently, a new temporal-focused contrastive loss is designed to fine-tune the CLAP model by incorporating these synthetic data. We conduct comprehensive experiments and analysis in multiple downstream tasks. T-CLAP shows improved capability in capturing the temporal relationship of sound events and outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17806v1,2024-04
Empirical Analysis of Dialogue Relation Extraction with Large Language Models,"Guozheng Li, Zijie Xu, Ziyu Shang, Jiajun Liu, Ke Ji, Yikai Guo","Dialogue relation extraction (DRE) aims to extract relations between two arguments within a dialogue, which is more challenging than standard RE due to the higher person pronoun frequency and lower information density in dialogues. However, existing DRE methods still suffer from two serious issues: (1) hard to capture long and sparse multi-turn information, and (2) struggle to extract golden relations based on partial dialogues, which motivates us to discover more effective methods that can alleviate the above issues. We notice that the rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked considerable interest in evaluating their performance across diverse tasks. To this end, we initially investigate the capabilities of different LLMs in DRE, considering both proprietary models and open-source models. Interestingly, we discover that LLMs significantly alleviate two issues in existing DRE methods. Generally, we have following findings: (1) scaling up model size substantially boosts the overall DRE performance and achieves exceptional results, tackling the difficulty of capturing long and sparse multi-turn information; (2) LLMs encounter with much smaller performance drop from entire dialogue setting to partial dialogue setting compared to existing methods; (3) LLMs deliver competitive or superior performances under both full-shot and few-shot settings compared to current state-of-the-art; (4) LLMs show modest performances on inverse relations but much stronger improvements on general relations, and they can handle dialogues of various lengths especially for longer sequences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17802v1,2024-04

In this study, we constructed Swallow, an LLM with enhanced Japanese capability, by extending the vocabulary of Llama 2 to include Japanese characters and conducting continual pre-training on a large Japanese web corpus. Experimental results confirmed that the performance on Japanese tasks drastically improved through continual pre-training, and the performance monotonically increased with the amount of training data up to 100B tokens. Consequently, Swallow achieved superior performance compared to other LLMs that were trained from scratch in English and Japanese. An analysis of the effects of continual pre-training revealed that it was particularly effective for Japanese question answering tasks. Furthermore, to elucidate effective methodologies for cross-lingual continual pre-training from English to Japanese, we investigated the impact of vocabulary expansion and the effectiveness of incorporating parallel corpora. The results showed that the efficiency gained through vocabulary expansion had no negative impact on performance, except for the summarization task, and that the combined use of parallel corpora enhanced translation ability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17790v1,2024-04
Temporal Scaling Law for Large Language Models,"Yizhe Xiong, Xiansheng Chen, Xin Ye, Hui Chen, Zijia Lin, Haoran Lian, Zhenpeng Su, Jianwei Niu, Guiguang Ding","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in a wide range of tasks, leading to increasing attention towards the research on how scaling LLMs affects their performance. Existing works, termed Scaling Laws, have discovered that the final test loss of LLMs scales as power-laws with model size, computational budget, and dataset size. However, the temporal change of the test loss of an LLM throughout its pre-training process remains unexplored, though it is valuable in many aspects, such as selecting better hyperparameters \textit{directly} on the target LLM. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of Temporal Scaling Law, studying how the test loss of an LLM evolves as the training steps scale up. In contrast to modeling the test loss as a whole in a coarse-grained manner, we break it down and dive into the fine-grained test loss of each token position, and further develop a dynamic hyperbolic-law. Afterwards, we derive the much more precise temporal scaling law by studying the temporal patterns of the parameters in the dynamic hyperbolic-law. Results on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) validation datasets demonstrate that our temporal scaling law accurately predicts the test loss of LLMs across training steps. Our temporal scaling law has broad practical applications. First, it enables direct and efficient hyperparameter selection on the target LLM, such as data mixture proportions. Secondly, viewing the LLM pre-training dynamics from the token position granularity provides some insights to enhance the understanding of LLM pre-training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17785v2,2024-04
Medical Vision-Language Pre-Training for Brain Abnormalities,"Masoud Monajatipoor, Zi-Yi Dou, Aichi Chien, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang","Vision-language models have become increasingly powerful for tasks that require an understanding of both visual and linguistic elements, bridging the gap between these modalities.

In this paper, we take brain abnormalities as an example to demonstrate how to automatically collect medical image-text aligned data for pretraining from public resources such as PubMed. In particular, we present a pipeline that streamlines the pre-training process by initially collecting a large brain image-text dataset from case reports and published journals and subsequently constructing a high-performance vision-language model tailored to specific medical tasks.

This paper introduces MRScore, an automatic evaluation metric tailored for radiology report generation by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Conventional NLG (natural language generation) metrics like BLEU are inadequate for accurately assessing the generated radiology reports, as systematically demonstrated by our observations within this paper. To address this challenge, we collaborated with radiologists to develop a framework that guides LLMs for radiology report evaluation, ensuring alignment with human analysis. Our framework includes two key components: i) utilizing GPT to generate large amounts of training data, i.e., reports with different qualities, and ii) pairing GPT-generated reports as accepted and rejected samples and training LLMs to produce MRScore as the model reward. Our experiments demonstrate MRScore's higher correlation with human judgments and superior performance in model selection compared to traditional metrics.

Evaluating the Application of ChatGPT in Outpatient Triage Guidance: A Comparative Study,"Dou Liu, Ying Han, Xiandi Wang, Xiaomei Tan, Di Liu, Guangwu Qian, Kang Li, Dan Pu, Rong Yin","The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare presents a transformative potential for enhancing operational efficiency and health outcomes. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have shown their capabilities in supporting medical decision-making. Embedding LLMs in medical systems is becoming a promising trend in healthcare development. The potential of ChatGPT to address the triage problem in emergency departments has been examined, while few studies have explored its application in outpatient departments. With a focus on streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency for outpatient triage, this study specifically aims to evaluate the consistency of responses provided by ChatGPT in outpatient guidance, including both within-version response analysis and between-version comparisons. For within-version, the results indicate that the internal response consistency for ChatGPT-4.0 is significantly higher than ChatGPT-3.5 (p=0.03) and both have a moderate consistency (71.2% for 4.0 and 59.6% for 3.5) in their top recommendation. However, the between-version consistency is relatively low (mean consistency score=1.43/3, median=1), indicating few recommendations match between the two versions. Also, only 50% top recommendations match perfectly in the comparisons. Interestingly, ChatGPT-3.5 responses are more likely to be complete than those from ChatGPT-4.0 (p=0.02), suggesting possible differences in information processing and response generation between the two versions. The findings offer insights into AI-assisted outpatient operations, while also facilitating the exploration of potentials and limitations of LLMs in healthcare utilization. Future research may focus on carefully optimizing LLMs and AI integration in healthcare systems based on ergonomic and human factors principles, precisely aligning with the specific needs of effective outpatient triage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00728v1,2024-04
UMass-BioNLP at MEDIQA-M3G 2024: DermPrompt -- A Systematic Exploration of Prompt Engineering with GPT-4V for Dermatological Diagnosis,"Parth Vashisht, Abhilasha Lodha, Mukta Maddipatla, Zonghai Yao, Avijit Mitra, Zhichao Yang, Junda Wang, Sunjae Kwon, Hong Yu","This paper presents our team's participation in the MEDIQA-ClinicalNLP2024 shared task B. We present a novel approach to diagnosing clinical dermatology cases by integrating large multimodal models, specifically leveraging the capabilities of GPT-4V under a retriever and a re-ranker framework. Our investigation reveals that GPT-4V, when used as a retrieval agent, can accurately retrieve the correct skin condition 85% of the time using dermatological images and brief patient histories. Additionally, we empirically show that Naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) works well for retrieval while Medical Guidelines Grounded CoT is required for accurate dermatological diagnosis. Further, we introduce a Multi-Agent Conversation (MAC) framework and show its superior performance and potential over the best CoT strategy. The experiments suggest that using naive CoT for retrieval and multi-agent conversation for critique-based diagnosis, GPT-4V can lead to an early and accurate diagnosis of dermatological conditions. The implications of this work extend to improving diagnostic workflows, supporting dermatological education, and enhancing patient care by providing a scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic tool.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17749v2,2024-04
Building a Large Japanese Web Corpus for Large Language Models,"Naoaki Okazaki, Kakeru Hattori, Hirai Shota, Hiroki Iida, Masanari Ohi, Kazuki Fujii, Taishi Nakamura, Mengsay Loem, Rio Yokota, Sakae Mizuki","Open Japanese large language models (LLMs) have been trained on the Japanese portions of corpora such as CC-100, mC4, and OSCAR. However, these corpora were not created for the quality of Japanese texts. This study builds a large Japanese web corpus by extracting and refining text from the Common Crawl archive (21 snapshots of approximately 63.4 billion pages crawled between 2020 and 2023). This corpus consists of approximately 312.1 billion characters (approximately 173 million pages), which is the largest of all available training corpora for Japanese LLMs, surpassing CC-100 (approximately 25.8 billion characters), mC4 (approximately 239.7 billion characters) and OSCAR 23.10 (approximately 74 billion characters). To confirm the quality of the corpus, we performed continual pre-training on Llama 2 7B, 13B, 70B, Mistral 7B v0.1, and Mixtral 8x7B Instruct as base LLMs and gained consistent (6.6-8.1 points) improvements on Japanese benchmark datasets.

Bridging the Social & Technical Divide in Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Applications for Autistic Adults,"Lara J. Martin, Malathy Nagalakshmi","Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are being used more frequently to improve high-tech Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), but many of these techniques are integrated without the inclusion of the users' perspectives. Autistic adults are particularly neglected in the design of AAC tools. We conducted in-depth interviews with 12 autistic adults to find the pain points of current AAC and determine what technological advances they might find helpful. We found that in addition to technological issues, there are many societal issues as well. We found 9 different categories of themes from our interviews: input flexibility, output flexibility, selecting or adapting AAC for a good fit, when to start or swap AAC, benefits, access as an adult, stumbling blocks for continued use, social concerns, and control of communication. In this paper, we go through these categories in depth and then suggest possible guidelines for developers, NLP researchers, and policy makers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17730v2,2024-04
"CoMM: Collaborative Multi-Agent, Multi-Reasoning-Path Prompting for Complex Problem Solving","Pei Chen, Boran Han, Shuai Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great ability in solving traditional natural language tasks and elementary reasoning tasks with appropriate prompting techniques. However, their ability is still limited in solving complicated science problems. In this work, we aim to push the upper bound of the reasoning capability of LLMs by proposing a collaborative multi-agent, multi-reasoning-path (CoMM) prompting framework. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to play different roles in a problem-solving team, and encourage different role-play agents to collaboratively solve the target task. In particular, we discover that applying different reasoning paths for different roles is an effective strategy to implement few-shot prompting approaches in the multi-agent scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on two college-level science problems over competitive baselines. Our further analysis shows the necessity of prompting LLMs to play different roles or experts independently.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Knowledge Graphs for Customer Service Question Answering,"Zhentao Xu, Mark Jerome Cruz, Matthew Guevara, Tie Wang, Manasi Deshpande, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Li","In customer service technical support, swiftly and accurately retrieving relevant past issues is critical for efficiently resolving customer inquiries. The conventional retrieval methods in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs) treat a large corpus of past issue tracking tickets as plain text, ignoring the crucial intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations, which limits performance. We introduce a novel customer service question-answering method that amalgamates RAG with a knowledge graph (KG). Our method constructs a KG from historical issues for use in retrieval, retaining the intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations. During the question-answering phase, our method parses consumer queries and retrieves related sub-graphs from the KG to generate answers. This integration of a KG not only improves retrieval accuracy by preserving customer service structure information but also enhances answering quality by mitigating the effects of text segmentation. Empirical assessments on our benchmark datasets, utilizing key retrieval (MRR, Recall@K, NDCG@K) and text generation (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR) metrics, reveal that our method outperforms the baseline by 77.6% in MRR and by 0.32 in BLEU. Our method has been deployed within LinkedIn's customer service team for approximately six months and has reduced the median per-issue resolution time by 28.6%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17723v2,2024-04
Questioning the Unknown: Optimising Multi-Agent Collaboration in Narrative-Driven Games,"Qinglin Zhu, Runcong Zhao, Jinhua Du, Lin Gui, Yulan He","We present Questum, a novel framework for Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents in Murder Mystery Games (MMGs). MMGs pose unique challenges, including undefined state spaces, absent intermediate rewards, and the need for strategic interaction in a continuous language domain. Questum addresses these complexities through a sensor-based representation of agent states, a question-targeting mechanism guided by information gain, and a pruning strategy to refine suspect lists and enhance decision-making efficiency. To enable systematic evaluation, we propose WellPlay, a dataset comprising 1,482 inferential questions across 12 games, categorised into objectives, reasoning, and relationships. Experiments demonstrate Questum's capacity to achieve superior performance in reasoning accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches, while also significantly improving the quality of agent-human interactions in MMGs.

Empowering Large Language Models for Textual Data Augmentation,"Yichuan Li, Kaize Ding, Jianling Wang, Kyumin Lee","With the capabilities of understanding and executing natural language instructions, Large language models (LLMs) can potentially act as a powerful tool for textual data augmentation. However, the quality of augmented data depends heavily on the augmentation instructions provided, and the effectiveness can fluctuate across different downstream tasks. While manually crafting and selecting instructions can offer some improvement, this approach faces scalability and consistency issues in practice due to the diversity of downstream tasks. In this work, we address these limitations by proposing a new solution, which can automatically generate a large pool of augmentation instructions and select the most suitable task-informed instructions, thereby empowering LLMs to create high-quality augmented data for different downstream tasks. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently generates augmented data with better quality compared to non-LLM and LLM-based data augmentation methods, leading to the best performance on 26 few-shot learning tasks sourced from a wide range of application domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17642v1,2024-04

In this paper we propose a novel method for numerically evaluating text quality in large unlabelled NLP datasets in a model agnostic manner to assign the text instances a ""quality score"".   By proposing the text quality metric, the paper establishes a framework to identify and eliminate low-quality text instances, leading to improved training efficiency for LM models. Experimental results over multiple models and datasets demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, showcasing substantial gains in training effectiveness and highlighting the potential for resource-efficient LM training.   For example, we observe an absolute accuracy improvement of 0.9% averaged over 14 downstream evaluation tasks for multiple LM models while using 40% lesser data and training 42% faster when training on the OpenWebText dataset and 0.8% average absolute accuracy improvement while using 20% lesser data and training 21% faster on the Wikipedia dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01582v3,2024-04
A Semi-Automatic Approach to Create Large Gender- and Age-Balanced Speaker Corpora: Usefulness of Speaker Diarization & Identification,"Rémi Uro, David Doukhan, Albert Rilliard, Laëtitia Larcher, Anissa-Claire Adgharouamane, Marie Tahon, Antoine Laurent","This paper presents a semi-automatic approach to create a diachronic corpus of voices balanced for speaker's age, gender, and recording period, according to 32 categories (2 genders, 4 age ranges and 4 recording periods). Corpora were selected at French National Institute of Audiovisual (INA) to obtain at least 30 speakers per category (a total of 960 speakers; only 874 have be found yet). For each speaker, speech excerpts were extracted from audiovisual documents using an automatic pipeline consisting of speech detection, background music and overlapped speech removal and speaker diarization, used to present clean speaker segments to human annotators identifying target speakers. This pipeline proved highly effective, cutting down manual processing by a factor of ten. Evaluation of the quality of the automatic processing and of the final output is provided. It shows the automatic processing compare to up-to-date process, and that the output provides high quality speech for most of the selected excerpts. This method shows promise for creating large corpora of known target speakers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17552v1,2024-04
Probabilistic Inference in Language Models via Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,"Stephen Zhao, Rob Brekelmans, Alireza Makhzani, Roger Grosse","Numerous capability and safety techniques of Large Language Models (LLMs), including RLHF, automated red-teaming, prompt engineering, and infilling, can be cast as sampling from an unnormalized target distribution defined by a given reward or potential function over the full sequence. In this work, we leverage the rich toolkit of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for these probabilistic inference problems. In particular, we use learned twist functions to estimate the expected future value of the potential at each timestep, which enables us to focus inference-time computation on promising partial sequences. We propose a novel contrastive method for learning the twist functions, and establish connections with the rich literature of soft reinforcement learning. As a complementary application of our twisted SMC framework, we present methods for evaluating the accuracy of language model inference techniques using novel bidirectional SMC bounds on the log partition function. These bounds can be used to estimate the KL divergence between the inference and target distributions in both directions. We apply our inference evaluation techniques to show that twisted SMC is effective for sampling undesirable outputs from a pretrained model (a useful component of harmlessness training and automated red-teaming), generating reviews with varied sentiment, and performing infilling tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17546v1,2024-04
The Mercurial Top-Level Ontology of Large Language Models,"Nele Köhler, Fabian Neuhaus","In our work, we systematize and analyze implicit ontological commitments in the responses generated by large language models (LLMs), focusing on ChatGPT 3.5 as a case study. We investigate how LLMs, despite having no explicit ontology, exhibit implicit ontological categorizations that are reflected in the texts they generate. The paper proposes an approach to understanding the ontological commitments of LLMs by defining ontology as a theory that provides a systematic account of the ontological commitments of some text. We investigate the ontological assumptions of ChatGPT and present a systematized account, i.e., GPT's top-level ontology. This includes a taxonomy, which is available as an OWL file, as well as a discussion about ontological assumptions (e.g., about its mereology or presentism). We show that in some aspects GPT's top-level ontology is quite similar to existing top-level ontologies. However, there are significant challenges arising from the flexible nature of LLM-generated texts, including ontological overload, ambiguity, and inconsistency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01581v1,2024-04
Large Language Model Agent as a Mechanical Designer,"Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani","Conventional mechanical design paradigms rely on experts systematically refining concepts through experience-guided modification and FEA to meet specific requirements. However, this approach can be time-consuming and heavily dependent on prior knowledge and experience. While numerous machine learning models have been developed to streamline this intensive and expert-driven iterative process, these methods typically demand extensive training data and considerable computational resources. Furthermore, methods based on deep learning are usually restricted to the specific domains and tasks for which they were trained, limiting their applicability across different tasks. This creates a trade-off between the efficiency of automation and the demand for resources. In this study, we present a novel approach that integrates pre-trained LLMs with a FEM module. The FEM module evaluates each design and provides essential feedback, guiding the LLMs to continuously learn, plan, generate, and optimize designs without the need for domain-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in managing the iterative optimization of truss structures, showcasing its capability to reason about and refine designs according to structured feedback and criteria. Our results reveal that these LLM-based agents can successfully generate truss designs that comply with natural language specifications with a success rate of up to 90%, which varies according to the applied constraints. By employing prompt-based optimization techniques we show that LLM based agents exhibit optimization behavior when provided with solution-score pairs to iteratively refine designs to meet specifications. This ability of LLM agents to produce viable designs and optimize them based on their inherent reasoning capabilities highlights their potential to develop and implement effective design strategies autonomously.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17525v2,2024-04
On the Use of Large Language Models to Generate Capability Ontologies,"Luis Miguel Vieira da Silva, Aljosha Köcher, Felix Gehlhoff, Alexander Fay","Capability ontologies are increasingly used to model functionalities of systems or machines. The creation of such ontological models with all properties and constraints of capabilities is very complex and can only be done by ontology experts. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that they can generate machine-interpretable models from natural language text input and thus support engineers / ontology experts. Therefore, this paper investigates how LLMs can be used to create capability ontologies. We present a study with a series of experiments in which capabilities with varying complexities are generated using different prompting techniques and with different LLMs. Errors in the generated ontologies are recorded and compared. To analyze the quality of the generated ontologies, a semi-automated approach based on RDF syntax checking, OWL reasoning, and SHACL constraints is used. The results of this study are very promising because even for complex capabilities, the generated ontologies are almost free of errors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17524v4,2024-04
A Comprehensive Evaluation on Event Reasoning of Large Language Models,"Zhengwei Tao, Zhi Jin, Yifan Zhang, Xiancai Chen, Haiyan Zhao, Jia Li, Bing Liang, Chongyang Tao, Qun Liu, Kam-Fai Wong","Event reasoning is a fundamental ability that underlies many applications. It requires event schema knowledge to perform global reasoning and needs to deal with the diversity of the inter-event relations and the reasoning paradigms. How well LLMs accomplish event reasoning on various relations and reasoning paradigms remains unknown. To mitigate this disparity, we comprehensively evaluate the abilities of event reasoning of LLMs. We introduce a novel benchmark EV2 for EValuation of EVent reasoning. EV2 consists of two levels of evaluation of schema and instance and is comprehensive in relations and reasoning paradigms. We conduct extensive experiments on EV2. We find that LLMs have abilities to accomplish event reasoning but their performances are far from satisfactory. We also notice the imbalance of event reasoning abilities in LLMs. Besides, LLMs have event schema knowledge, however, they're not aligned with humans on how to utilize the knowledge. Based on these findings, we guide the LLMs in utilizing the event schema knowledge as memory leading to improvements on event reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17513v2,2024-04

CEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Counterfactual Text Generation,"Van Bach Nguyen, Jörg Schlötterer, Christin Seifert","Counterfactual text generation aims to minimally change a text, such that it is classified differently. Judging advancements in method development for counterfactual text generation is hindered by a non-uniform usage of data sets and metrics in related work. We propose CEval, a benchmark for comparing counterfactual text generation methods. CEval unifies counterfactual and text quality metrics, includes common counterfactual datasets with human annotations, standard baselines (MICE, GDBA, CREST) and the open-source language model LLAMA-2. Our experiments found no perfect method for generating counterfactual text. Methods that excel at counterfactual metrics often produce lower-quality text while LLMs with simple prompts generate high-quality text but struggle with counterfactual criteria. By making CEval available as an open-source Python library, we encourage the community to contribute more methods and maintain consistent evaluation in future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17475v2,2024-04
Ruffle&Riley: Insights from Designing and Evaluating a Large Language Model-Based Conversational Tutoring System,"Robin Schmucker, Meng Xia, Amos Azaria, Tom Mitchell","Conversational tutoring systems (CTSs) offer learning experiences through interactions based on natural language. They are recognized for promoting cognitive engagement and improving learning outcomes, especially in reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, the cost associated with authoring CTS content is a major obstacle to widespread adoption and to research on effective instructional design. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate a novel type of CTS that leverages recent advances in large language models (LLMs) in two ways: First, the system enables AI-assisted content authoring by inducing an easily editable tutoring script automatically from a lesson text. Second, the system automates the script orchestration in a learning-by-teaching format via two LLM-based agents (Ruffle&Riley) acting as a student and a professor. The system allows for free-form conversations that follow the ITS-typical inner and outer loop structure. We evaluate Ruffle&Riley's ability to support biology lessons in two between-subject online user studies (N = 200) comparing the system to simpler QA chatbots and reading activity. Analyzing system usage patterns, pre/post-test scores and user experience surveys, we find that Ruffle&Riley users report high levels of engagement, understanding and perceive the offered support as helpful. Even though Ruffle&Riley users require more time to complete the activity, we did not find significant differences in short-term learning gains over the reading activity. Our system architecture and user study provide various insights for designers of future CTSs. We further open-source our system to support ongoing research on effective instructional design of LLM-based learning technologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17460v1,2024-04
Language Interaction Network for Clinical Trial Approval Estimation,"Chufan Gao, Tianfan Fu, Jimeng Sun","Clinical trial outcome prediction seeks to estimate the likelihood that a clinical trial will successfully reach its intended endpoint. This process predominantly involves the development of machine learning models that utilize a variety of data sources such as descriptions of the clinical trials, characteristics of the drug molecules, and specific disease conditions being targeted. Accurate predictions of trial outcomes are crucial for optimizing trial planning and prioritizing investments in a drug portfolio. While previous research has largely concentrated on small-molecule drugs, there is a growing need to focus on biologics-a rapidly expanding category of therapeutic agents that often lack the well-defined molecular properties associated with traditional drugs. Additionally, applying conventional methods like graph neural networks to biologics data proves challenging due to their complex nature. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language Interaction Network (LINT), a novel approach that predicts trial outcomes using only the free-text descriptions of the trials. We have rigorously tested the effectiveness of LINT across three phases of clinical trials, where it achieved ROC-AUC scores of 0.770, 0.740, and 0.748 for phases I, II, and III, respectively, specifically concerning trials involving biologic interventions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06662v1,2024-04
Evaluation of Geographical Distortions in Language Models: A Crucial Step Towards Equitable Representations,"Rémy Decoupes, Roberto Interdonato, Mathieu Roche, Maguelonne Teisseire, Sarah Valentin","Language models now constitute essential tools for improving efficiency for many professional tasks such as writing, coding, or learning. For this reason, it is imperative to identify inherent biases. In the field of Natural Language Processing, five sources of bias are well-identified: data, annotation, representation, models, and research design. This study focuses on biases related to geographical knowledge. We explore the connection between geography and language models by highlighting their tendency to misrepresent spatial information, thus leading to distortions in the representation of geographical distances. This study introduces four indicators to assess these distortions, by comparing geographical and semantic distances. Experiments are conducted from these four indicators with ten widely used language models. Results underscore the critical necessity of inspecting and rectifying spatial biases in language models to ensure accurate and equitable representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17401v1,2024-04
Child Speech Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction: Problem Solved?,"Ruben Janssens, Eva Verhelst, Giulio Antonio Abbo, Qiaoqiao Ren, Maria Jose Pinto Bernal, Tony Belpaeme","Automated Speech Recognition shows superhuman performance for adult English speech on a range of benchmarks, but disappoints when fed children's speech. This has long sat in the way of child-robot interaction. Recent evolutions in data-driven speech recognition, including the availability of Transformer architectures and unprecedented volumes of training data, might mean a breakthrough for child speech recognition and social robot applications aimed at children. We revisit a study on child speech recognition from 2017 and show that indeed performance has increased, with newcomer OpenAI Whisper doing markedly better than leading commercial cloud services. Performance improves even more in highly structured interactions when priming models with specific phrases. While transcription is not perfect yet, the best model recognises 60.3% of sentences correctly barring small grammatical differences, with sub-second transcription time running on a local GPU, showing potential for usable autonomous child-robot speech interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17394v2,2024-04
LLMs for Generating and Evaluating Counterfactuals: A Comprehensive Study,"Van Bach Nguyen, Paul Youssef, Christin Seifert, Jörg Schlötterer","As NLP models become more complex, understanding their decisions becomes more crucial. Counterfactuals (CFs), where minimal changes to inputs flip a model's prediction, offer a way to explain these models. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in NLP tasks, their efficacy in generating high-quality CFs remains uncertain. This work fills this gap by investigating how well LLMs generate CFs for two NLU tasks. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of several common LLMs, and evaluate their CFs, assessing both intrinsic metrics, and the impact of these CFs on data augmentation. Moreover, we analyze differences between human and LLM-generated CFs, providing insights for future research directions. Our results show that LLMs generate fluent CFs, but struggle to keep the induced changes minimal. Generating CFs for Sentiment Analysis (SA) is less challenging than NLI where LLMs show weaknesses in generating CFs that flip the original label. This also reflects on the data augmentation performance, where we observe a large gap between augmenting with human and LLMs CFs. Furthermore, we evaluate LLMs' ability to assess CFs in a mislabelled data setting, and show that they have a strong bias towards agreeing with the provided labels. GPT4 is more robust against this bias and its scores correlate well with automatic metrics. Our findings reveal several limitations and point to potential future work directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00722v2,2024-04
A Bionic Natural Language Parser Equivalent to a Pushdown Automaton,"Zhenghao Wei, Kehua Lin, Jianlin Feng","Assembly Calculus (AC), proposed by Papadimitriou et al., aims to reproduce advanced cognitive functions through simulating neural activities, with several applications based on AC having been developed, including a natural language parser proposed by Mitropolsky et al. However, this parser lacks the ability to handle Kleene closures, preventing it from parsing all regular languages and rendering it weaker than Finite Automata (FA). In this paper, we propose a new bionic natural language parser (BNLP) based on AC and integrates two new biologically rational structures, Recurrent Circuit and Stack Circuit which are inspired by RNN and short-term memory mechanism. In contrast to the original parser, the BNLP can fully handle all regular languages and Dyck languages. Therefore, leveraging the Chomsky-Sch \H{u}tzenberger theorem, the BNLP which can parse all Context-Free Languages can be constructed. We also formally prove that for any PDA, a Parser Automaton corresponding to BNLP can always be formed, ensuring that BNLP has a description ability equal to that of PDA and addressing the deficiencies of the original parser.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17343v1,2024-04

This is especially evident in the context of data annotation, a task whose importance cannot be underestimated, but which is time-consuming and costly. Thus, any dataset for resource-poor languages is precious, in particular when it is task-specific. Here, we explore the feasibility of repurposing existing datasets for a new NLP task: we repurposed the Belebele dataset (Bandarkar et al., 2023), which was designed for multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), to enable extractive QA (EQA) in the style of machine reading comprehension. We present annotation guidelines and a parallel EQA dataset for English and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We also present QA evaluation results for several monolingual and cross-lingual QA pairs including English, MSA, and five Arabic dialects. Our aim is to enable others to adapt our approach for the 120+ other language variants in Belebele, many of which are deemed under-resourced. We also conduct a thorough analysis and share our insights from the process, which we hope will contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and the opportunities associated with task reformulation in NLP research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17342v1,2024-04
Metronome: tracing variation in poetic meters via local sequence alignment,"Ben Nagy, Artjoms Šeļa, Mirella De Sisto, Petr Plecháč","All poetic forms come from somewhere. Prosodic templates can be copied for generations, altered by individuals, imported from foreign traditions, or fundamentally changed under the pressures of language evolution. Yet these relationships are notoriously difficult to trace across languages and times. This paper introduces an unsupervised method for detecting structural similarities in poems using local sequence alignment. The method relies on encoding poetic texts as strings of prosodic features using a four-letter alphabet; these sequences are then aligned to derive a distance measure based on weighted symbol (mis)matches. Local alignment allows poems to be clustered according to emergent properties of their underlying prosodic patterns. We evaluate method performance on a meter recognition tasks against strong baselines and show its potential for cross-lingual and historical research using three short case studies: 1) mutations in quantitative meter in classical Latin, 2) European diffusion of the Renaissance hendecasyllable, and 3) comparative alignment of modern meters in 18--19th century Czech, German and Russian.

Then, we introduce new finetune datasets for basic language models to fulfill user requests and new evaluation datasets for measuring the capabilities of Turkish language models.

When to Trust LLMs: Aligning Confidence with Response Quality,"Shuchang Tao, Liuyi Yao, Hanxing Ding, Yuexiang Xie, Qi Cao, Fei Sun, Jinyang Gao, Huawei Shen, Bolin Ding","Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language generation, much evidence shows that LLMs may produce incorrect or nonsensical text. This limitation highlights the importance of discerning when to trust LLMs, especially in safety-critical domains. Existing methods often express reliability by confidence level, however, their effectiveness is limited by the lack of objective guidance. To address this, we propose CONfidence-Quality-ORDer-preserving alignment approach (CONQORD), which leverages reinforcement learning guided by a tailored dual-component reward function. This function integrates quality reward and order-preserving alignment reward functions. Specifically, the order-preserving reward incentivizes the model to verbalize greater confidence for responses of higher quality to align the order of confidence and quality. Experiments demonstrate that CONQORD significantly improves the alignment performance between confidence and response accuracy, without causing over-cautious. Furthermore, the aligned confidence provided by CONQORD informs when to trust LLMs, and acts as a determinant for initiating the retrieval process of external knowledge. Aligning confidence with response quality ensures more transparent and reliable responses, providing better trustworthiness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17287v3,2024-04
Reinforcement Retrieval Leveraging Fine-grained Feedback for Fact Checking News Claims with Black-Box LLM,"Xuan Zhang, Wei Gao","Retrieval-augmented language models have exhibited promising performance across various areas of natural language processing (NLP), including fact-critical tasks. However, due to the black-box nature of advanced large language models (LLMs) and the non-retrieval-oriented supervision signal of specific tasks, the training of retrieval model faces significant challenges under the setting of black-box LLM. We propose an approach leveraging Fine-grained Feedback with Reinforcement Retrieval (FFRR) to enhance fact-checking on news claims by using black-box LLM. FFRR adopts a two-level strategy to gather fine-grained feedback from the LLM, which serves as a reward for optimizing the retrieval policy, by rating the retrieved documents based on the non-retrieval ground truth of the task. We evaluate our model on two public datasets for real-world news claim verification, and the results demonstrate that FFRR achieves significant improvements over strong LLM-enabled and non-LLM baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17283v1,2024-04
Prompting Techniques for Reducing Social Bias in LLMs through System 1 and System 2 Cognitive Processes,"Mahammed Kamruzzaman, Gene Louis Kim","Dual process theory posits that human cognition arises via two systems. System 1, which is a quick, emotional, and intuitive process, which is subject to cognitive biases, and System 2, is a slow, onerous, and deliberate process. NLP researchers often compare zero-shot prompting in LLMs to System 1 reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to System 2. In line with this interpretation, prior research has found that using CoT prompting in LLMs leads to reduced gender bias. We investigate the relationship between bias, CoT prompting, a debiasing prompt, and dual process theory in LLMs directly. We compare zero-shot CoT, debiasing, and a variety of dual process theory-based prompting strategies on two bias datasets spanning nine different social bias categories. We incorporate human and machine personas to determine whether the effects of dual process theory in LLMs exist independent of explicit persona models or are based on modeling human cognition. We find that a human persona, debiasing, System 2, and CoT prompting all tend to reduce social biases in LLMs, though the best combination of features depends on the exact model and bias category -- resulting in up to a 19 percent drop in stereotypical judgments by an LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17218v3,2024-04
Prompting Towards Alleviating Code-Switched Data Scarcity in Under-Resourced Languages with GPT as a Pivot,"Michelle Terblanche, Kayode Olaleye, Vukosi Marivate","Many multilingual communities, including numerous in Africa, frequently engage in code-switching during conversations. This behaviour stresses the need for natural language processing technologies adept at processing code-switched text. However, data scarcity, particularly in African languages, poses a significant challenge, as many are low-resourced and under-represented. In this study, we prompted GPT 3.5 to generate Afrikaans--English and Yoruba--English code-switched sentences, enhancing diversity using topic-keyword pairs, linguistic guidelines, and few-shot examples. Our findings indicate that the quality of generated sentences for languages using non-Latin scripts, like Yoruba, is considerably lower when compared with the high Afrikaans-English success rate. There is therefore a notable opportunity to refine prompting guidelines to yield sentences suitable for the fine-tuning of language models. We propose a framework for augmenting the diversity of synthetically generated code-switched data using GPT and propose leveraging this technology to mitigate data scarcity in low-resourced languages, underscoring the essential role of native speakers in this process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17216v1,2024-04
TIGQA:An Expert Annotated Question Answering Dataset in Tigrinya,"Hailay Teklehaymanot, Dren Fazlija, Niloy Ganguly, Gourab K. Patro, Wolfgang Nejdl","The absence of explicitly tailored, accessible annotated datasets for educational purposes presents a notable obstacle for NLP tasks in languages with limited resources.This study initially explores the feasibility of using machine translation (MT) to convert an existing dataset into a Tigrinya dataset in SQuAD format. As a result, we present TIGQA, an expert annotated educational dataset consisting of 2.68K question-answer pairs covering 122 diverse topics such as climate, water, and traffic. These pairs are from 537 context paragraphs in publicly accessible Tigrinya and Biology books. Through comprehensive analyses, we demonstrate that the TIGQA dataset requires skills beyond simple word matching, requiring both single-sentence and multiple-sentence inference abilities. We conduct experiments using state-of-the art MRC methods, marking the first exploration of such models on TIGQA. Additionally, we estimate human performance on the dataset and juxtapose it with the results obtained from pretrained models.The notable disparities between human performance and best model performance underscore the potential for further enhancements to TIGQA through continued research.

Prevalent Frequency of Emotional and Physical Symptoms in Social Anxiety using Zero Shot Classification: An Observational Study,"Muhammad Rizwan, Jure Demšar","Social anxiety represents a prevalent challenge in modern society, affecting individuals across personal and professional spheres. Left unaddressed, this condition can yield substantial negative consequences, impacting social interactions and performance. Further understanding its diverse physical and emotional symptoms becomes pivotal for comprehensive diagnosis and tailored therapeutic interventions. This study analyze prevalence and frequency of social anxiety symptoms taken from Mayo Clinic, exploring diverse human experiences from utilizing a large Reddit dataset dedicated to this issue. Leveraging these platforms, the research aims to extract insights and examine a spectrum of physical and emotional symptoms linked to social anxiety disorder. Upholding ethical considerations, the study maintains strict user anonymity within the dataset. By employing a novel approach, the research utilizes BART-based multi-label zero-shot classification to identify and measure symptom prevalence and significance in the form of probability score for each symptom under consideration. Results uncover distinctive patterns: ""Trembling"" emerges as a prevalent physical symptom, while emotional symptoms like ""Fear of being judged negatively"" exhibit high frequencies. These findings offer insights into the multifaceted nature of social anxiety, aiding clinical practices and interventions tailored to its diverse expressions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17183v1,2024-04
A Unified Label-Aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition,"Haojie Zhang, Yimeng Zhuang","Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to extract named entities using only a limited number of labeled examples. Existing contrastive learning methods often suffer from insufficient distinguishability in context vector representation because they either solely rely on label semantics or completely disregard them. To tackle this issue, we propose a unified label-aware token-level contrastive learning framework. Our approach enriches the context by utilizing label semantics as suffix prompts. Additionally, it simultaneously optimizes context-context and context-label contrastive learning objectives to enhance generalized discriminative contextual representations.Extensive experiments on various traditional test domains (OntoNotes, CoNLL'03, WNUT'17, GUM, I2B2) and the large-scale few-shot NER dataset (FEWNERD) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. It outperforms prior state-of-the-art models by a significant margin, achieving an average absolute gain of 7% in micro F1 scores across most scenarios. Further analysis reveals that our model benefits from its powerful transfer capability and improved contextual representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17178v2,2024-04
HateTinyLLM : Hate Speech Detection Using Tiny Large Language Models,"Tanmay Sen, Ansuman Das, Mrinmay Sen","Hate speech encompasses verbal, written, or behavioral communication that targets derogatory or discriminatory language against individuals or groups based on sensitive characteristics. Automated hate speech detection plays a crucial role in curbing its propagation, especially across social media platforms. Various methods, including recent advancements in deep learning, have been devised to address this challenge. In this study, we introduce HateTinyLLM, a novel framework based on fine-tuned decoder-only tiny large language models (tinyLLMs) for efficient hate speech detection. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the fine-tuned HateTinyLLM outperforms the pretrained mixtral-7b model by a significant margin. We explored various tiny LLMs, including PY007/TinyLlama-1.1B-step-50K-105b, Microsoft/phi-2, and facebook/opt-1.3b, and fine-tuned them using LoRA and adapter methods.

Quantifying Memorization and Detecting Training Data of Pre-trained Language Models using Japanese Newspaper,"Shotaro Ishihara, Hiromu Takahashi","Dominant pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated the potential risk of memorizing and outputting the training data. While this concern has been discussed mainly in English, it is also practically important to focus on domain-specific PLMs. In this study, we pre-trained domain-specific GPT-2 models using a limited corpus of Japanese newspaper articles and evaluated their behavior. Experiments replicated the empirical finding that memorization of PLMs is related to the duplication in the training data, model size, and prompt length, in Japanese the same as in previous English studies. Furthermore, we attempted membership inference attacks, demonstrating that the training data can be detected even in Japanese, which is the same trend as in English. The study warns that domain-specific PLMs, sometimes trained with valuable private data, can ''copy and paste'' on a large scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17143v2,2024-04
Small Language Models Need Strong Verifiers to Self-Correct Reasoning,"Yunxiang Zhang, Muhammad Khalifa, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Jaekyeom Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Lu Wang","Self-correction has emerged as a promising solution to boost the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), where LLMs refine their solutions using self-generated critiques that pinpoint the errors. This work explores whether small (<= 13B) language models (LMs) have the ability of self-correction on reasoning tasks with minimal inputs from stronger LMs. We propose a novel pipeline that prompts smaller LMs to collect self-correction data that supports the training of self-refinement abilities. First, we leverage correct solutions to guide the model in critiquing their incorrect responses. Second, the generated critiques, after filtering, are used for supervised fine-tuning of the self-correcting reasoner through solution refinement. Our experimental results show improved self-correction abilities of two models on five datasets spanning math and commonsense reasoning, with notable performance gains when paired with a strong GPT-4-based verifier, though limitations are identified when using a weak self-verifier for determining when to correct.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17140v2,2024-04
Automated Data Visualization from Natural Language via Large Language Models: An Exploratory Study,"Yang Wu, Yao Wan, Hongyu Zhang, Yulei Sui, Wucai Wei, Wei Zhao, Guandong Xu, Hai Jin","The Natural Language to Visualization (NL2Vis) task aims to transform natural-language descriptions into visual representations for a grounded table, enabling users to gain insights from vast amounts of data. Recently, many deep learning-based approaches have been developed for NL2Vis. Despite the considerable efforts made by these approaches, challenges persist in visualizing data sourced from unseen databases or spanning multiple tables. Taking inspiration from the remarkable generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper conducts an empirical study to evaluate their potential in generating visualizations, and explore the effectiveness of in-context learning prompts for enhancing this task. In particular, we first explore the ways of transforming structured tabular data into sequential text prompts, as to feed them into LLMs and analyze which table content contributes most to the NL2Vis. Our findings suggest that transforming structured tabular data into programs is effective, and it is essential to consider the table schema when formulating prompts. Furthermore, we evaluate two types of LLMs: finetuned models (e.g., T5-Small) and inference-only models (e.g., GPT-3.5), against state-of-the-art methods, using the NL2Vis benchmarks (i.e., nvBench). The experimental results reveal that LLMs outperform baselines, with inference-only models consistently exhibiting performance improvements, at times even surpassing fine-tuned models when provided with certain few-shot demonstrations through in-context learning. Finally, we analyze when the LLMs fail in NL2Vis, and propose to iteratively update the results using strategies such as chain-of-thought, role-playing, and code-interpreter. The experimental results confirm the efficacy of iterative updates and hold great potential for future study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17136v1,2024-04
Text Sentiment Analysis and Classification Based on Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) Model,"Wei Xu, Jianlong Chen, Zhicheng Ding, Jinyin Wang","This paper explores the importance of text sentiment analysis and classification in the field of natural language processing, and proposes a new approach to sentiment analysis and classification based on the bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) model. The study firstly analyses the word cloud model of the text with six sentiment labels, and then carries out data preprocessing, including the steps of removing special symbols, punctuation marks, numbers, stop words and non-alphabetic parts. Subsequently, the data set is divided into training set and test set, and through model training and testing, it is found that the accuracy of the validation set is increased from 85% to 93% with training, which is an increase of 8%; at the same time, the loss value of the validation set decreases from 0.7 to 0.1 and tends to be stable, and the model is gradually close to the actual value, which can effectively classify the text emotions. The confusion matrix shows that the accuracy of the model on the test set reaches 94.8%, the precision is 95.9%, the recall is 99.1%, and the F1 score is 97.4%, which proves that the model has good generalisation ability and classification effect. Overall, the study demonstrated an effective method for text sentiment analysis and classification with satisfactory results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17123v2,2024-04
2M-NER: Contrastive Learning for Multilingual and Multimodal NER with Language and Modal Fusion,"Dongsheng Wang, Xiaoqin Feng, Zeming Liu, Chuan Wang","Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying and classifying entities in sentences into pre-defined types. It plays a crucial role in various research fields, including entity linking, question answering, and online product recommendation. Recent studies have shown that incorporating multilingual and multimodal datasets can enhance the effectiveness of NER. This is due to language transfer learning and the presence of shared implicit features across different modalities. However, the lack of a dataset that combines multilingualism and multimodality has hindered research exploring the combination of these two aspects, as multimodality can help NER in multiple languages simultaneously. In this paper, we aim to address a more challenging task: multilingual and multimodal named entity recognition (MMNER), considering its potential value and influence. Specifically, we construct a large-scale MMNER dataset with four languages (English, French, German and Spanish) and two modalities (text and image). To tackle this challenging MMNER task on the dataset, we introduce a new model called 2M-NER, which aligns the text and image representations using contrastive learning and integrates a multimodal collaboration module to effectively depict the interactions between the two modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the highest F1 score in multilingual and multimodal NER tasks compared to some comparative and representative baselines. Additionally, in a challenging analysis, we discovered that sentence-level alignment interferes a lot with NER models, indicating the higher level of difficulty in our dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17122v1,2024-04
Talking Nonsense: Probing Large Language Models' Understanding of Adversarial Gibberish Inputs,"Valeriia Cherepanova, James Zou","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit excellent ability to understand human languages, but do they also understand their own language that appears gibberish to us? In this work we delve into this question, aiming to uncover the mechanisms underlying such behavior in LLMs. We employ the Greedy Coordinate Gradient optimizer to craft prompts that compel LLMs to generate coherent responses from seemingly nonsensical inputs. We call these inputs LM Babel and this work systematically studies the behavior of LLMs manipulated by these prompts. We find that the manipulation efficiency depends on the target text's length and perplexity, with the Babel prompts often located in lower loss minima compared to natural prompts. We further examine the structure of the Babel prompts and evaluate their robustness. Notably, we find that guiding the model to generate harmful texts is not more difficult than into generating benign texts, suggesting lack of alignment for out-of-distribution prompts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17120v2,2024-04
CoSD: Collaborative Stance Detection with Contrastive Heterogeneous Topic Graph Learning,"Yinghan Cheng, Qi Zhang, Chongyang Shi, Liang Xiao, Shufeng Hao, Liang Hu","Stance detection seeks to identify the viewpoints of individuals either in favor or against a given target or a controversial topic. Current advanced neural models for stance detection typically employ fully parametric softmax classifiers. However, these methods suffer from several limitations, including lack of explainability, insensitivity to the latent data structure, and unimodality, which greatly restrict their performance and applications. To address these challenges, we present a novel collaborative stance detection framework called (CoSD) which leverages contrastive heterogeneous topic graph learning to learn topic-aware semantics and collaborative signals among texts, topics, and stance labels for enhancing stance detection. During training, we construct a heterogeneous graph to structurally organize texts and stances through implicit topics via employing latent Dirichlet allocation. We then perform contrastive graph learning to learn heterogeneous node representations, aggregating informative multi-hop collaborative signals via an elaborate Collaboration Propagation Aggregation (CPA) module. During inference, we introduce a hybrid similarity scoring module to enable the comprehensive incorporation of topic-aware semantics and collaborative signals for stance detection. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art detection performance of CoSD, verifying the effectiveness and explainability of our collaborative framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17609v2,2024-04

Our testbed is a text-adventure game in which players attempt to solve a mystery under a fixed narrative premise, but can freely interact with non-player characters generated by GPT-4, a large language model. We recruit 28 gamers to play the game and use GPT-4 to automatically convert the game logs into a node-graph representing the narrative in the player's gameplay. We find that through their interactions with the non-deterministic behavior of the LLM, players are able to discover interesting new emergent nodes that were not a part of the original narrative but have potential for being fun and engaging. Players that created the most emergent nodes tended to be those that often enjoy games that facilitate discovery, exploration and experimentation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17027v3,2024-04
Türkçe Dil Modellerinin Performans Karşılaştırması Performance Comparison of Turkish Language Models,"Eren Dogan, M. Egemen Uzun, Atahan Uz, H. Emre Seyrek, Ahmed Zeer, Ezgi Sevi, H. Toprak Kesgin, M. Kaan Yuce, M. Fatih Amasyali","The developments that language models have provided in fulfilling almost all kinds of tasks have attracted the attention of not only researchers but also the society and have enabled them to become products. There are commercially successful language models available. However, users may prefer open-source language models due to cost, data privacy, or regulations. Yet, despite the increasing number of these models, there is no comprehensive comparison of their performance for Turkish. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature. A comparison is made among seven selected language models based on their contextual learning and question-answering abilities. Turkish datasets for contextual learning and question-answering were prepared, and both automatic and human evaluations were conducted. The results show that for question-answering, continuing pretraining before fine-tuning with instructional datasets is more successful in adapting multilingual models to Turkish and that in-context learning performances do not much related to question-answering performances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17010v1,2024-04
Evaluating Class Membership Relations in Knowledge Graphs using Large Language Models,"Bradley P. Allen, Paul T. Groth","A backbone of knowledge graphs are their class membership relations, which assign entities to a given class. As part of the knowledge engineering process, we propose a new method for evaluating the quality of these relations by processing descriptions of a given entity and class using a zero-shot chain-of-thought classifier that uses a natural language intensional definition of a class. We evaluate the method using two publicly available knowledge graphs, Wikidata and CaLiGraph, and 7 large language models. Using the gpt-4-0125-preview large language model, the method's classification performance achieves a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.830 on data from Wikidata and 0.893 on data from CaLiGraph. Moreover, a manual analysis of the classification errors shows that 40.9% of errors were due to the knowledge graphs, with 16.0% due to missing relations and 24.9% due to incorrectly asserted relations. These results show how large language models can assist knowledge engineers in the process of knowledge graph refinement.

GuideWalk: A Novel Graph-Based Word Embedding for Enhanced Text Classification,"Sarmad N. Mohammed, Semra Gündüç","One of the prime problems of computer science and machine learning is to extract information efficiently from large-scale, heterogeneous data. Text data, with its syntax, semantics, and even hidden information content, possesses an exceptional place among the data types in concern. The processing of the text data requires embedding, a method of translating the content of the text to numeric vectors. A correct embedding algorithm is the starting point for obtaining the full information content of the text data. In this work, a new text embedding approach, namely the Guided Transition Probability Matrix (GTPM) model is proposed. The model uses the graph structure of sentences to capture different types of information from text data, such as syntactic, semantic, and hidden content. Using random walks on a weighted word graph, GTPM calculates transition probabilities to derive text embedding vectors. The proposed method is tested with real-world data sets and eight well-known and successful embedding algorithms. GTPM shows significantly better classification performance for binary and multi-class datasets than well-known algorithms. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates superior robustness, maintaining performance with limited (only $10\%$) training data, showing an $8\%$ decline compared to $15-20\%$ for baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18942v2,2024-04
Examining the robustness of LLM evaluation to the distributional assumptions of benchmarks,"Melissa Ailem, Katerina Marazopoulou, Charlotte Siska, James Bono","Benchmarks have emerged as the central approach for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). The research community often relies on a model's average performance across the test prompts of a benchmark to evaluate the model's performance. This is consistent with the assumption that the test prompts within a benchmark represent a random sample from a real-world distribution of interest. We note that this is generally not the case; instead, we hold that the distribution of interest varies according to the specific use case. We find that (1) the correlation in model performance across test prompts is non-random, (2) accounting for correlations across test prompts can change model rankings on major benchmarks, (3) explanatory factors for these correlations include semantic similarity and common LLM failure points.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16966v2,2024-04
A Closer Look at Classification Evaluation Metrics and a Critical Reflection of Common Evaluation Practice,Juri Opitz,"Classification systems are evaluated in a countless number of papers. However, we find that evaluation practice is often nebulous. Frequently, metrics are selected without arguments, and blurry terminology invites misconceptions. For instance, many works use so-called 'macro' metrics to rank systems (e.g., 'macro F1') but do not clearly specify what they would expect from such a `macro' metric. This is problematic, since picking a metric can affect research findings, and thus any clarity in the process should be maximized.   Starting from the intuitive concepts of bias and prevalence, we perform an analysis of common evaluation metrics. The analysis helps us understand the metrics' underlying properties, and how they align with expectations as found expressed in papers. Then we reflect on the practical situation in the field, and survey evaluation practice in recent shared tasks. We find that metric selection is often not supported with convincing arguments, an issue that can make a system ranking seem arbitrary. Our work aims at providing overview and guidance for more informed and transparent metric selection, fostering meaningful evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16958v2,2024-04

A Survey of Generative Search and Recommendation in the Era of Large Language Models,"Yongqi Li, Xinyu Lin, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Liang Pang, Wenjie Li, Liqiang Nie, Xiangnan He, Tat-Seng Chua","With the information explosion on the Web, search and recommendation are foundational infrastructures to satisfying users' information needs. As the two sides of the same coin, both revolve around the same core research problem, matching queries with documents or users with items. In the recent few decades, search and recommendation have experienced synchronous technological paradigm shifts, including machine learning-based and deep learning-based paradigms. Recently, the superintelligent generative large language models have sparked a new paradigm in search and recommendation, i.e., generative search (retrieval) and recommendation, which aims to address the matching problem in a generative manner. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging paradigm in information systems and summarize the developments in generative search and recommendation from a unified perspective. Rather than simply categorizing existing works, we abstract a unified framework for the generative paradigm and break down the existing works into different stages within this framework to highlight the strengths and weaknesses. And then, we distinguish generative search and recommendation with their unique challenges, identify open problems and future directions, and envision the next information-seeking paradigm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16924v1,2024-04
IndicGenBench: A Multilingual Benchmark to Evaluate Generation Capabilities of LLMs on Indic Languages,"Harman Singh, Nitish Gupta, Shikhar Bharadwaj, Dinesh Tewari, Partha Talukdar","As large language models (LLMs) see increasing adoption across the globe, it is imperative for LLMs to be representative of the linguistic diversity of the world. India is a linguistically diverse country of 1.4 Billion people. To facilitate research on multilingual LLM evaluation, we release IndicGenBench - the largest benchmark for evaluating LLMs on user-facing generation tasks across a diverse set 29 of Indic languages covering 13 scripts and 4 language families. IndicGenBench is composed of diverse generation tasks like cross-lingual summarization, machine translation, and cross-lingual question answering. IndicGenBench extends existing benchmarks to many Indic languages through human curation providing multi-way parallel evaluation data for many under-represented Indic languages for the first time. We evaluate a wide range of proprietary and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM-2, mT5, Gemma, BLOOM and LLaMA on IndicGenBench in a variety of settings. The largest PaLM-2 models performs the best on most tasks, however, there is a significant performance gap in all languages compared to English showing that further research is needed for the development of more inclusive multilingual language models.

Make Your LLM Fully Utilize the Context,"Shengnan An, Zexiong Ma, Zeqi Lin, Nanning Zheng, Jian-Guang Lou","While many contemporary large language models (LLMs) can process lengthy input, they still struggle to fully utilize information within the long context, known as the lost-in-the-middle challenge. We hypothesize that it stems from insufficient explicit supervision during the long-context training, which fails to emphasize that any position in a long context can hold crucial information. Based on this intuition, our study presents information-intensive (IN2) training, a purely data-driven solution to overcome lost-in-the-middle. Specifically, IN2 training leverages a synthesized long-context question-answer dataset, where the answer requires (1) fine-grained information awareness on a short segment (~128 tokens) within a synthesized long context (4K-32K tokens), and (2) the integration and reasoning of information from two or more short segments. Through applying this information-intensive training on Mistral-7B, we present FILM-7B (FILl-in-the-Middle). To thoroughly assess the ability of FILM-7B for utilizing long contexts, we design three probing tasks that encompass various context styles (document, code, and structured-data context) and information retrieval patterns (forward, backward, and bi-directional retrieval). The probing results demonstrate that FILM-7B can robustly retrieve information from different positions in its 32K context window. Beyond these probing tasks, FILM-7B significantly improves the performance on real-world long-context tasks (e.g., 23.5->26.9 F1 score on NarrativeQA), while maintaining a comparable performance on short-context tasks (e.g., 59.3->59.2 accuracy on MMLU).

Improving Diversity of Commonsense Generation by Large Language Models via In-Context Learning,"Tianhui Zhang, Bei Peng, Danushka Bollegala","Generative Commonsense Reasoning (GCR) requires a model to reason about a situation using commonsense knowledge, while generating coherent sentences. Although the quality of the generated sentences is crucial, the diversity of the generation is equally important because it reflects the model's ability to use a range of commonsense knowledge facts. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in enhancing the generation quality across various tasks through in-context learning (ICL) using given examples without the need for any fine-tuning. However, the diversity aspect in LLM outputs has not been systematically studied before. To address this, we propose a simple method that diversifies the LLM generations, while preserving their quality. Experimental results on three benchmark GCR datasets show that our method achieves an ideal balance between the quality and diversity. Moreover, the sentences generated by our proposed method can be used as training data to improve diversity in existing commonsense generators.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16807v2,2024-04

Weak-to-Strong Extrapolation Expedites Alignment,"Chujie Zheng, Ziqi Wang, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Nanyun Peng","The open-source community is experiencing a surge in the release of large language models (LLMs) that are trained to follow instructions and align with human preference. However, further training to improve them still requires expensive computational resources and data annotations. Is it possible to bypass additional training and cost-effectively acquire better-aligned models? Inspired by the literature on model interpolation, we propose a simple method called ExPO to boost LLMs' alignment with human preference. Utilizing a model that has undergone alignment training (e.g., via DPO or RLHF) and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO directly obtains a better-aligned model by extrapolating from the weights of the initial and the aligned models, which implicitly optimizes the alignment objective via first-order approximation. Through experiments with twelve open-source LLMs on HuggingFace, we demonstrate that ExPO consistently improves off-the-shelf DPO/RLHF models, as evaluated on the mainstream LLM benchmarks AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench. Moreover, ExPO exhibits remarkable scalability across various model sizes (from 1.8B to 70B) and capabilities. Through controlled experiments and further empirical analyses, we shed light on the essence of ExPO amplifying the reward signal learned during alignment training. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of model extrapolation in expediting the alignment of LLMs with human preference, suggesting a promising direction for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16792v2,2024-04
Continual Learning of Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey,"Haizhou Shi, Zihao Xu, Hengyi Wang, Weiyi Qin, Wenyuan Wang, Yibin Wang, Zifeng Wang, Sayna Ebrahimi, Hao Wang","The recent success of large language models (LLMs) trained on static, pre-collected, general datasets has sparked numerous research directions and applications. One such direction addresses the non-trivial challenge of integrating pre-trained LLMs into dynamic data distributions, task structures, and user preferences. Pre-trained LLMs, when tailored for specific needs, often experience significant performance degradation in previous knowledge domains -- a phenomenon known as ""catastrophic forgetting"". While extensively studied in the continual learning (CL) community, it presents new manifestations in the realm of LLMs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress on LLMs within the context of CL. This survey is structured into four main sections: we first describe an overview of continually learning LLMs, consisting of two directions of continuity: vertical continuity (or vertical continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation from general to specific capabilities, and horizontal continuity (or horizontal continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation across time and domains (Section 3). We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of modern CL: Continual Pre-Training (CPT), Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP), and Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) (Section 4). Then we provide an overview of evaluation protocols for continual learning with LLMs, along with the current available data sources (Section 5). Finally, we discuss intriguing questions pertaining to continual learning for LLMs (Section 6). The full list of papers examined in this survey is available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/llm-continual-learning-survey.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16789v3,2024-04
Uncovering Deceptive Tendencies in Language Models: A Simulated Company AI Assistant,"Olli Järviniemi, Evan Hubinger","We study the tendency of AI systems to deceive by constructing a realistic simulation setting of a company AI assistant. The simulated company employees provide tasks for the assistant to complete, these tasks spanning writing assistance, information retrieval and programming. We then introduce situations where the model might be inclined to behave deceptively, while taking care to not instruct or otherwise pressure the model to do so. Across different scenarios, we find that Claude 3 Opus   1) complies with a task of mass-generating comments to influence public perception of the company, later deceiving humans about it having done so,   2) lies to auditors when asked questions, and   3) strategically pretends to be less capable than it is during capability evaluations.   Our work demonstrates that even models trained to be helpful, harmless and honest sometimes behave deceptively in realistic scenarios, without notable external pressure to do so.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01576v1,2024-04
Modeling Selective Feature Attention for Representation-based Siamese Text Matching,"Jianxiang Zang, Hui Liu","Representation-based Siamese networks have risen to popularity in lightweight text matching due to their low deployment and inference costs. While word-level attention mechanisms have been implemented within Siamese networks to improve performance, we propose Feature Attention (FA), a novel downstream block designed to enrich the modeling of dependencies among embedding features. Employing ""squeeze-and-excitation"" techniques, the FA block dynamically adjusts the emphasis on individual features, enabling the network to concentrate more on features that significantly contribute to the final classification. Building upon FA, we introduce a dynamic ""selection"" mechanism called Selective Feature Attention (SFA), which leverages a stacked BiGRU Inception structure. The SFA block facilitates multi-scale semantic extraction by traversing different stacked BiGRU layers, encouraging the network to selectively concentrate on semantic information and embedding features across varying levels of abstraction. Both the FA and SFA blocks offer a seamless integration capability with various Siamese networks, showcasing a plug-and-play characteristic. Experimental evaluations conducted across diverse text matching baselines and benchmarks underscore the indispensability of modeling feature attention and the superiority of the ""selection"" mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16776v1,2024-04

This paper introduces a domain-specific Cant dataset and CantCounter evaluation framework, employing Fine-Tuning, Co-Tuning, Data-Diffusion, and Data-Analysis stages. Experiments reveal LLMs, including ChatGPT, are susceptible to cant bypassing filters, with varying recognition accuracy influenced by question types, setups, and prompt clues. Updated models exhibit higher acceptance rates for cant queries. Moreover, LLM reactions differ across domains, e.g., reluctance to engage in racism versus LGBT topics. These findings underscore LLMs' understanding of cant and reflect training data characteristics and vendor approaches to sensitive topics. Additionally, we assess LLMs' ability to demonstrate reasoning capabilities.

Exploring News Summarization and Enrichment in a Highly Resource-Scarce Indian Language: A Case Study of Mizo,"Abhinaba Bala, Ashok Urlana, Rahul Mishra, Parameswari Krishnamurthy","Obtaining sufficient information in one's mother tongue is crucial for satisfying the information needs of the users. While high-resource languages have abundant online resources, the situation is less than ideal for very low-resource languages. Moreover, the insufficient reporting of vital national and international events continues to be a worry, especially in languages with scarce resources, like \textbf{Mizo}. In this paper, we conduct a study to investigate the effectiveness of a simple methodology designed to generate a holistic summary for Mizo news articles, which leverages English-language news to supplement and enhance the information related to the corresponding news events. Furthermore, we make available 500 Mizo news articles and corresponding enriched holistic summaries.

REBEL: Reinforcement Learning via Regressing Relative Rewards,"Zhaolin Gao, Jonathan D. Chang, Wenhao Zhan, Owen Oertell, Gokul Swamy, Kianté Brantley, Thorsten Joachims, J. Andrew Bagnell, Jason D. Lee, Wen Sun","While originally developed for continuous control problems, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as the work-horse of a variety of reinforcement learning (RL) applications, including the fine-tuning of generative models. Unfortunately, PPO requires multiple heuristics to enable stable convergence (e.g. value networks, clipping), and is notorious for its sensitivity to the precise implementation of these components. In response, we take a step back and ask what a minimalist RL algorithm for the era of generative models would look like. We propose REBEL, an algorithm that cleanly reduces the problem of policy optimization to regressing the relative reward between two completions to a prompt in terms of the policy, enabling strikingly lightweight implementation. In theory, we prove that fundamental RL algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient can be seen as variants of REBEL, which allows us to match the strongest known theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence and sample complexity in the RL literature. REBEL can also cleanly incorporate offline data and be extended to handle the intransitive preferences we frequently see in practice. Empirically, we find that REBEL provides a unified approach to language modeling and image generation with stronger or similar performance as PPO and DPO, all while being simpler to implement and more computationally efficient than PPO. When fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Instruct, REBEL achieves strong performance in AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and Open LLM Leaderboard.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16767v4,2024-04
Prefix Text as a Yarn: Eliciting Non-English Alignment in Foundation Language Model,"Runzhe Zhan, Xinyi Yang, Derek F. Wong, Lidia S. Chao, Yue Zhang","While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been a straightforward approach for tailoring the output of foundation large language model (LLM) to specific preferences, concerns have been raised about the depth of this alignment, with some critiques suggesting it is merely ""superficial"". We critically examine this hypothesis within the scope of cross-lingual generation tasks, proposing that the effectiveness of SFT may be constrained by its reliance on prior tokens to guide cross-lingual generation. Based on this crucial insight, and in response to the challenges posed by the costly and limited availability of non-English data for SFT, we introduce a novel training-free alignment method named PreTTY, which employs minimal task-related prior tokens to bridge the foundation LLM and the SFT LLM, achieving comparable performance without training. Experiments on machine translation and part-of-speech tagging across eight languages demonstrate the efficacy of PreTTY in cross-lingual settings. Remarkably, by initiating the decoding process with only one or two prior tokens, foundation LLMs can achieve performance comparable to their SFT counterparts. This method presents a cost-effective alternative to SFT and advances the democratization of multilingual LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16766v1,2024-04
Dataset of Quotation Attribution in German News Articles,"Fynn Petersen-Frey, Chris Biemann","Extracting who says what to whom is a crucial part in analyzing human communication in today's abundance of data such as online news articles.

Automatic Speech Recognition System-Independent Word Error Rate Estimation,"Chanho Park, Mingjie Chen, Thomas Hain","Word error rate (WER) is a metric used to evaluate the quality of transcriptions produced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. In many applications, it is of interest to estimate WER given a pair of a speech utterance and a transcript. Previous work on WER estimation focused on building models that are trained with a specific ASR system in mind (referred to as ASR system-dependent). These are also domain-dependent and inflexible in real-world applications. In this paper, a hypothesis generation method for ASR System-Independent WER estimation (SIWE) is proposed. In contrast to prior work, the WER estimators are trained using data that simulates ASR system output. Hypotheses are generated using phonetically similar or linguistically more likely alternative words. In WER estimation experiments, the proposed method reaches a similar performance to ASR system-dependent WER estimators on in-domain data and achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain data. On the out-of-domain data, the SIWE model outperformed the baseline estimators in root mean square error and Pearson correlation coefficient by relative 17.58% and 18.21%, respectively, on Switchboard and CALLHOME. The performance was further improved when the WER of the training set was close to the WER of the evaluation dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16743v2,2024-04
LayerSkip: Enabling Early Exit Inference and Self-Speculative Decoding,"Mostafa Elhoushi, Akshat Shrivastava, Diana Liskovich, Basil Hosmer, Bram Wasti, Liangzhen Lai, Anas Mahmoud, Bilge Acun, Saurabh Agarwal, Ahmed Roman, Ahmed A Aly, Beidi Chen, Carole-Jean Wu","We present LayerSkip, an end-to-end solution to speed-up inference of large language models (LLMs). First, during training we apply layer dropout, with low dropout rates for earlier layers and higher dropout rates for later layers, and an early exit loss where all transformer layers share the same exit. Second, during inference, we show that this training recipe increases the accuracy of early exit at earlier layers, without adding any auxiliary layers or modules to the model. Third, we present a novel self-speculative decoding solution where we exit at early layers and verify and correct with remaining layers of the model. Our proposed self-speculative decoding approach has less memory footprint than other speculative decoding approaches and benefits from shared compute and activations of the draft and verification stages. We run experiments on different Llama model sizes on different types of training: pretraining from scratch, continual pretraining, finetuning on specific data domain, and finetuning on specific task. We implement our inference solution and show speedups of up to 2.16x on summarization for CNN/DM documents, 1.82x on coding, and 2.0x on TOPv2 semantic parsing task.

Cooperate or Collapse: Emergence of Sustainable Cooperation in a Society of LLM Agents,"Giorgio Piatti, Zhijing Jin, Max Kleiman-Weiner, Bernhard Schölkopf, Mrinmaya Sachan, Rada Mihalcea","As AI systems pervade human life, ensuring that large language models (LLMs) make safe decisions remains a significant challenge. We introduce the Governance of the Commons Simulation (GovSim), a generative simulation platform designed to study strategic interactions and cooperative decision-making in LLMs. In GovSim, a society of AI agents must collectively balance exploiting a common resource with sustaining it for future use. This environment enables the study of how ethical considerations, strategic planning, and negotiation skills impact cooperative outcomes. We develop an LLM-based agent architecture and test it with the leading open and closed LLMs. We find that all but the most powerful LLM agents fail to achieve a sustainable equilibrium in GovSim, with the highest survival rate below 54%. Ablations reveal that successful multi-agent communication between agents is critical for achieving cooperation in these cases. Furthermore, our analyses show that the failure to achieve sustainable cooperation in most LLMs stems from their inability to formulate and analyze hypotheses about the long-term effects of their actions on the equilibrium of the group. Finally, we show that agents that leverage ""Universalization""-based reasoning, a theory of moral thinking, are able to achieve significantly better sustainability. Taken together, GovSim enables us to study the mechanisms that underlie sustainable self-government with specificity and scale.

Influence of Solution Efficiency and Valence of Instruction on Additive and Subtractive Solution Strategies in Humans and GPT-4,"Lydia Uhler, Verena Jordan, Jürgen Buder, Markus Huff, Frank Papenmeier","Generative artificial intelligences, particularly large language models (LLMs), play an increasingly prominent role in human decision-making contexts, necessitating transparency about their capabilities. While prior studies have shown addition biases in humans (Adams et al., 2021) and OpenAI's GPT-3 (Winter et al., 2023), this study extends the research by comparing human and GPT-4 problem-solving across both spatial and linguistic tasks, with variations in solution efficiency and valence of task instruction. Four preregistered experiments with 588 participants from the U.S. and 680 GPT-4 iterations revealed a stronger tendency towards additive transformations in GPT-4 than in humans. Human participants were less likely to use additive strategies when subtraction was relatively more efficient than when addition and subtraction were equally efficient. GPT-4 exhibited the opposite behavior, with a strong addition bias when subtraction was more efficient. In terms of valence of task instruction, GPT-4's use of additive strategies increased when instructed to ""improve"" (positive) rather than ""edit"" (neutral). These findings demonstrate that biases in human problem-solving are amplified in GPT-4, and that LLM behavior differs from human efficiency-based strategies. This highlights the limitations of LLMs and the need for caution when using them in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16692v3,2024-04

Prediction Is All MoE Needs: Expert Load Distribution Goes from Fluctuating to Stabilizing,"Peizhuang Cong, Aomufei Yuan, Shimao Chen, Yuxuan Tian, Bowen Ye, Tong Yang","MoE facilitates the development of large models by making the computational complexity of the model no longer scale linearly with increasing parameters. The learning sparse gating network selects a set of experts for each token to be processed; however, this may lead to differences in the number of tokens processed by each expert over several successive iterations, i.e., the expert load fluctuations, which reduces computational parallelization and resource utilization. To this end, we traced and analyzed loads of each expert in the training iterations for several large language models in this work, and defined the transient state with ""obvious load fluctuation"" and the stable state with ""temporal locality"". Moreover, given the characteristics of these two states and the computational overhead, we deployed three classical prediction algorithms that achieve accurate expert load prediction results. For the GPT3 350M model, the average error rates for predicting the expert load proportion over the next 1,000 and 2,000 steps are approximately 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. This work can provide valuable guidance for expert placement or resource allocation for MoE model training.

The GPT Surprise: Offering Large Language Model Chat in a Massive Coding Class Reduced Engagement but Increased Adopters Exam Performances,"Allen Nie, Yash Chandak, Miroslav Suzara, Malika Ali, Juliette Woodrow, Matt Peng, Mehran Sahami, Emma Brunskill, Chris Piech","Large language models (LLMs) are quickly being adopted in a wide range of learning experiences, especially via ubiquitous and broadly accessible chat interfaces like ChatGPT and Copilot. This type of interface is readily available to students and teachers around the world, yet relatively little research has been done to assess the impact of such generic tools on student learning. Coding education is an interesting test case, both because LLMs have strong performance on coding tasks, and because LLM-powered support tools are rapidly becoming part of the workflow of professional software engineers. To help understand the impact of generic LLM use on coding education, we conducted a large-scale randomized control trial with 5,831 students from 146 countries in an online coding class in which we provided some students with access to a chat interface with GPT-4. We estimate positive benefits on exam performance for adopters, the students who used the tool, but over all students, the advertisement of GPT-4 led to a significant average decrease in exam participation. We observe similar decreases in other forms of course engagement. However, this decrease is modulated by the student's country of origin. Offering access to LLMs to students from low human development index countries increased their exam participation rate on average. Our results suggest there may be promising benefits to using LLMs in an introductory coding class, but also potential harms for engagement, which makes their longer term impact on student success unclear. Our work highlights the need for additional investigations to help understand the potential impact of future adoption and integration of LLMs into classrooms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09975v1,2024-04

Our process incorporates continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback. We introduced a new approach, DistillDirect, for performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini 1.0 Pro as the teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, can generate clinical notes comparable in quality to those authored by physicians.

Incorporating Lexical and Syntactic Knowledge for Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Transfer,"Jianyu Zheng, Fengfei Fan, Jianquan Li","Unsupervised cross-lingual transfer involves transferring knowledge between languages without explicit supervision. Although numerous studies have been conducted to improve performance in such tasks by focusing on cross-lingual knowledge, particularly lexical and syntactic knowledge, current approaches are limited as they only incorporate syntactic or lexical information. Since each type of information offers unique advantages and no previous attempts have combined both, we attempt to explore the potential of this approach. In this paper, we present a novel framework called ""Lexicon-Syntax Enhanced Multilingual BERT"" that combines both lexical and syntactic knowledge. Specifically, we use Multilingual BERT (mBERT) as the base model and employ two techniques to enhance its learning capabilities. The code-switching technique is used to implicitly teach the model lexical alignment information, while a syntactic-based graph attention network is designed to help the model encode syntactic structure. To integrate both types of knowledge, we input code-switched sequences into both the syntactic module and the mBERT base model simultaneously. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate this framework can consistently outperform all baselines of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, with the gains of 1.0~3.7 points on text classification, named entity recognition (ner), and semantic parsing tasks.

Understanding Privacy Risks of Embeddings Induced by Large Language Models,"Zhihao Zhu, Ninglu Shao, Defu Lian, Chenwang Wu, Zheng Liu, Yi Yang, Enhong Chen","Large language models (LLMs) show early signs of artificial general intelligence but struggle with hallucinations. One promising solution to mitigate these hallucinations is to store external knowledge as embeddings, aiding LLMs in retrieval-augmented generation. However, such a solution risks compromising privacy, as recent studies experimentally showed that the original text can be partially reconstructed from text embeddings by pre-trained language models. The significant advantage of LLMs over traditional pre-trained models may exacerbate these concerns. To this end, we investigate the effectiveness of reconstructing original knowledge and predicting entity attributes from these embeddings when LLMs are employed. Empirical findings indicate that LLMs significantly improve the accuracy of two evaluated tasks over those from pre-trained models, regardless of whether the texts are in-distribution or out-of-distribution. This underscores a heightened potential for LLMs to jeopardize user privacy, highlighting the negative consequences of their widespread use. We further discuss preliminary strategies to mitigate this risk.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16587v1,2024-04
Exploring Internal Numeracy in Language Models: A Case Study on ALBERT,"Ulme Wennberg, Gustav Eje Henter","It has been found that Transformer-based language models have the ability to perform basic quantitative reasoning. In this paper, we propose a method for studying how these models internally represent numerical data, and use our proposal to analyze the ALBERT family of language models. Specifically, we extract the learned embeddings these models use to represent tokens that correspond to numbers and ordinals, and subject these embeddings to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA results reveal that ALBERT models of different sizes, trained and initialized separately, consistently learn to use the axes of greatest variation to represent the approximate ordering of various numerical concepts. Numerals and their textual counterparts are represented in separate clusters, but increase along the same direction in 2D space. Our findings illustrate that language models, trained purely to model text, can intuit basic mathematical concepts, opening avenues for NLP applications that intersect with quantitative reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16574v1,2024-04
Evaluating Large Language Models on Time Series Feature Understanding: A Comprehensive Taxonomy and Benchmark,"Elizabeth Fons, Rachneet Kaur, Soham Palande, Zhen Zeng, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso, Svitlana Vyetrenko","Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential for automatic time series analysis and reporting, which is a critical task across many domains, spanning healthcare, finance, climate, energy, and many more. In this paper, we propose a framework for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of LLMs on time series understanding, encompassing both univariate and multivariate forms. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of time series features, a critical framework that delineates various characteristics inherent in time series data. Leveraging this taxonomy, we have systematically designed and synthesized a diverse dataset of time series, embodying the different outlined features, each accompanied by textual descriptions. This dataset acts as a solid foundation for assessing the proficiency of LLMs in comprehending time series. Our experiments shed light on the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in time series understanding, revealing which features these models readily comprehend effectively and where they falter. In addition, we uncover the sensitivity of LLMs to factors including the formatting of the data, the position of points queried within a series and the overall time series length.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16563v2,2024-04
To what extent is ChatGPT useful for language teacher lesson plan creation?,"Alex Dornburg, Kristin Davin","The advent of generative AI models holds tremendous potential for aiding teachers in the generation of pedagogical materials. However, numerous knowledge gaps concerning the behavior of these models obfuscate the generation of research-informed guidance for their effective usage. Here we assess trends in prompt specificity, variability, and weaknesses in foreign language teacher lesson plans generated by zero-shot prompting in ChatGPT. Iterating a series of prompts that increased in complexity, we found that output lesson plans were generally high quality, though additional context and specificity to a prompt did not guarantee a concomitant increase in quality. Additionally, we observed extreme cases of variability in outputs generated by the same prompt. In many cases, this variability reflected a conflict between 20th century versus 21st century pedagogical practices. These results suggest that the training of generative AI models on classic texts concerning pedagogical practices may represent a currently underexplored topic with the potential to bias generated content towards teaching practices that have been long refuted by research. Collectively, our results offer immediate translational implications for practicing and training foreign language teachers on the use of AI tools. More broadly, these findings reveal the existence of generative AI output trends that have implications for the generation of pedagogical materials across a diversity of content areas.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09974v1,2024-04
Samsung Research China-Beijing at SemEval-2024 Task 3: A multi-stage framework for Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations,"Shen Zhang, Haojie Zhang, Jing Zhang, Xudong Zhang, Yimeng Zhuang, Jinting Wu","In human-computer interaction, it is crucial for agents to respond to human by understanding their emotions. Unraveling the causes of emotions is more challenging. A new task named Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations is responsible for recognizing emotion and identifying causal expressions. In this study, we propose a multi-stage framework to generate emotion and extract the emotion causal pairs given the target emotion. In the first stage, Llama-2-based InstructERC is utilized to extract the emotion category of each utterance in a conversation. After emotion recognition, a two-stream attention model is employed to extract the emotion causal pairs given the target emotion for subtask 2 while MuTEC is employed to extract causal span for subtask 1. Our approach achieved first place for both of the two subtasks in the competition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16905v1,2024-04
Building a Japanese Document-Level Relation Extraction Dataset Assisted by Cross-Lingual Transfer,"Youmi Ma, An Wang, Naoaki Okazaki","Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) is the task of extracting all semantic relationships from a document. While studies have been conducted on English DocRE, limited attention has been given to DocRE in non-English languages. This work delves into effectively utilizing existing English resources to promote DocRE studies in non-English languages, with Japanese as the representative case. As an initial attempt, we construct a dataset by transferring an English dataset to Japanese. However, models trained on such a dataset suffer from low recalls. We investigate the error cases and attribute the failure to different surface structures and semantics of documents translated from English and those written by native speakers. We thus switch to explore if the transferred dataset can assist human annotation on Japanese documents. In our proposal, annotators edit relation predictions from a model trained on the transferred dataset. Quantitative analysis shows that relation recommendations suggested by the model help reduce approximately 50% of the human edit steps compared with the previous approach. Experiments quantify the performance of existing DocRE models on our collected dataset, portraying the challenges of Japanese and cross-lingual DocRE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16506v1,2024-04
Evaluating Consistency and Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models,"Yash Saxena, Sarthak Chopra, Arunendra Mani Tripathi","Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used today across various sectors, including academia, research, business, and finance, for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation. Despite their widespread adoption, these models often produce incorrect and misleading information, exhibiting a tendency to hallucinate. This behavior can be attributed to several factors, with consistency and reasoning capabilities being significant contributors. LLMs frequently lack the ability to generate explanations and engage in coherent reasoning, leading to inaccurate responses. Moreover, they exhibit inconsistencies in their outputs. This paper aims to evaluate and compare the consistency and reasoning capabilities of both public and proprietary LLMs. The experiments utilize the Boolq dataset as the ground truth, comprising questions, answers, and corresponding explanations. Queries from the dataset are presented as prompts to the LLMs, and the generated responses are evaluated against the ground truth answers. Additionally, explanations are generated to assess the models' reasoning abilities. Consistency is evaluated by repeatedly presenting the same query to the models and observing for variations in their responses. For measuring reasoning capabilities, the generated explanations are compared to the ground truth explanations using metrics such as BERT, BLEU, and F-1 scores. The findings reveal that proprietary models generally outperform public models in terms of both consistency and reasoning capabilities. However, even when presented with basic general knowledge questions, none of the models achieved a score of 90\% in both consistency and reasoning. This study underscores the direct correlation between consistency and reasoning abilities in LLMs and highlights the inherent reasoning challenges present in current language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16478v1,2024-04
Large Language Models Perform on Par with Experts Identifying Mental Health Factors in Adolescent Online Forums,"Isabelle Lorge, Dan W. Joyce, Andrey Kormilitzin","Mental health in children and adolescents has been steadily deteriorating over the past few years. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers much hope for cost and time efficient scaling of monitoring and intervention, yet despite specifically prevalent issues such as school bullying and eating disorders, previous studies on have not investigated performance in this domain or for open information extraction where the set of answers is not predetermined. We create a new dataset of Reddit posts from adolescents aged 12-19 annotated by expert psychiatrists for the following categories: TRAUMA, PRECARITY, CONDITION, SYMPTOMS, SUICIDALITY and TREATMENT and compare expert labels to annotations from two top performing LLMs (GPT3.5 and GPT4). In addition, we create two synthetic datasets to assess whether LLMs perform better when annotating data as they generate it. We find GPT4 to be on par with human inter-annotator agreement and performance on synthetic data to be substantially higher, however we find the model still occasionally errs on issues of negation and factuality and higher performance on synthetic data is driven by greater complexity of real data rather than inherent advantage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16461v2,2024-04
Contextual Categorization Enhancement through LLMs Latent-Space,"Zineddine Bettouche, Anas Safi, Andreas Fischer","Managing the semantic quality of the categorization in large textual datasets, such as Wikipedia, presents significant challenges in terms of complexity and cost. In this paper, we propose leveraging transformer models to distill semantic information from texts in the Wikipedia dataset and its associated categories into a latent space. We then explore different approaches based on these encodings to assess and enhance the semantic identity of the categories. Our graphical approach is powered by Convex Hull, while we utilize Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSWs) for the hierarchical approach. As a solution to the information loss caused by the dimensionality reduction, we modulate the following mathematical solution: an exponential decay function driven by the Euclidean distances between the high-dimensional encodings of the textual categories. This function represents a filter built around a contextual category and retrieves items with a certain Reconsideration Probability (RP). Retrieving high-RP items serves as a tool for database administrators to improve data groupings by providing recommendations and identifying outliers within a contextual framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16442v1,2024-04
Instruction Matters: A Simple yet Effective Task Selection for Optimized Instruction Tuning of Specific Tasks,"Changho Lee, Janghoon Han, Seonghyeon Ye, Stanley Jungkyu Choi, Honglak Lee, Kyunghoon Bae","Instruction tuning has been proven effective in enhancing zero-shot generalization across various tasks and in improving the performance of specific tasks. For task-specific improvements, strategically selecting and training on related tasks that provide meaningful supervision is crucial, as this approach enhances efficiency and prevents performance degradation from learning irrelevant tasks. In this light, we introduce a simple yet effective task selection method that leverages instruction information alone to identify relevant tasks, optimizing instruction tuning for specific tasks. Our method is significantly more efficient than traditional approaches, which require complex measurements of pairwise transferability between tasks or the creation of data samples for the target task. Additionally, by aligning the model with the unique instructional template style of the meta-dataset, we enhance its ability to granularly discern relevant tasks, leading to improved overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that training on a small set of tasks, chosen solely based on the instructions, results in substantial improvements in performance on benchmarks such as P3, Big-Bench, NIV2, and Big-Bench Hard. Significantly, these improvements surpass those achieved by prior task selection methods, highlighting the superiority of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16418v2,2024-04
Asking and Answering Questions to Extract Event-Argument Structures,"Md Nayem Uddin, Enfa Rose George, Eduardo Blanco, Steven Corman","This paper presents a question-answering approach to extract document-level event-argument structures. We automatically ask and answer questions for each argument type an event may have. Questions are generated using manually defined templates and generative transformers. Template-based questions are generated using predefined role-specific wh-words and event triggers from the context document. Transformer-based questions are generated using large language models trained to formulate questions based on a passage and the expected answer. Additionally, we develop novel data augmentation strategies specialized in inter-sentential event-argument relations. We use a simple span-swapping technique, coreference resolution, and large language models to augment the training instances. Our approach enables transfer learning without any corpora-specific modifications and yields competitive results with the RAMS dataset. It outperforms previous work, and it is especially beneficial to extract arguments that appear in different sentences than the event trigger. We also present detailed quantitative and qualitative analyses shedding light on the most common errors made by our best model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16413v1,2024-04
U2++ MoE: Scaling 4.7x parameters with minimal impact on RTF,"Xingchen Song, Di Wu, Binbin Zhang, Dinghao Zhou, Zhendong Peng, Bo Dang, Fuping Pan, Chao Yang","Scale has opened new frontiers in natural language processing, but at a high cost. In response, by learning to only activate a subset of parameters in training and inference, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have been proposed as an energy efficient path to even larger and more capable language models and this shift towards a new generation of foundation models is gaining momentum, particularly within the field of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Recent works that incorporating MoE into ASR models have complex designs such as routing frames via supplementary embedding network, improving multilingual ability for the experts, and utilizing dedicated auxiliary losses for either expert load balancing or specific language handling. We found that delicate designs are not necessary, while an embarrassingly simple substitution of MoE layers for all Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers is competent for the ASR task. To be more specific, we benchmark our proposed model on a large scale inner-source dataset (160k hours), the results show that we can scale our baseline Conformer (Dense-225M) to its MoE counterparts (MoE-1B) and achieve Dense-1B level Word Error Rate (WER) while maintaining a Dense-225M level Real Time Factor (RTF). Furthermore, by applying Unified 2-pass framework with bidirectional attention decoders (U2++), we achieve the streaming and non-streaming decoding modes in a single MoE based model, which we call U2++ MoE. We hope that our study can facilitate the research on scaling speech foundation models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16407v2,2024-04
Lost in Recursion: Mining Rich Event Semantics in Knowledge Graphs,"Florian Plötzky, Niklas Kiehne, Wolf-Tilo Balke","Our world is shaped by events of various complexity. This includes both small-scale local events like local farmer markets and large complex events like political and military conflicts. The latter are typically not observed directly but through the lenses of intermediaries like newspapers or social media. In other words, we do not witness the unfolding of such events directly but are confronted with narratives surrounding them. Such narratives capture different aspects of a complex event and may also differ with respect to the narrator. Thus, they provide a rich semantics concerning real-world events. In this paper, we show how narratives concerning complex events can be constructed and utilized. We provide a formal representation of narratives based on recursive nodes to represent multiple levels of detail and discuss how narratives can be bound to event-centric knowledge graphs. Additionally, we provide an algorithm based on incremental prompting techniques that mines such narratives from texts to account for different perspectives on complex events. Finally, we show the effectiveness and future research directions in a proof of concept.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16405v1,2024-04
List Items One by One: A New Data Source and Learning Paradigm for Multimodal LLMs,"An Yan, Zhengyuan Yang, Junda Wu, Wanrong Zhu, Jianwei Yang, Linjie Li, Kevin Lin, Jianfeng Wang, Julian McAuley, Jianfeng Gao, Lijuan Wang","Set-of-Mark (SoM) Prompting unleashes the visual grounding capability of GPT-4V, by enabling the model to associate visual objects with tags inserted on the image. These tags, marked with alphanumerics, can be indexed via text tokens for easy reference. Despite the extraordinary performance from GPT-4V, we observe that other Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to understand these visual tags. To promote the learning of SoM prompting for open-source models, we propose a new learning paradigm: ""list items one by one,"" which asks the model to enumerate and describe all visual tags placed on the image following the alphanumeric orders of tags. By integrating our curated dataset with other visual instruction tuning datasets, we are able to equip existing MLLMs with the SoM prompting ability. Furthermore, we evaluate our finetuned SoM models on five MLLM benchmarks. We find that this new dataset, even in a relatively small size (10k-30k images with tags), significantly enhances visual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations for MLLMs. Perhaps surprisingly, these improvements persist even when the visual tags are omitted from input images during inference. This suggests the potential of ""list items one by one"" as a new paradigm for training MLLMs, which strengthens the object-text alignment through the use of visual tags in the training stage. Finally, we conduct analyses by probing trained models to understand the working mechanism of SoM.

Don't Say No: Jailbreaking LLM by Suppressing Refusal,"Yukai Zhou, Zhijie Huang, Feiyang Lu, Zhan Qin, Wenjie Wang","Ensuring the safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial to generating responses consistent with human values. Despite their ability to recognize and avoid harmful queries, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts seduce them to produce toxic content. One category of jailbreak attacks is reformulating the task as an optimization by eliciting the LLM to generate affirmative responses. However, such optimization objective has its own limitations, such as the restriction on the predefined objectionable behaviors, leading to suboptimal attack performance. In this study, we first uncover the reason why vanilla target loss is not optimal, then we explore and enhance the loss objective and introduce the DSN (Don't Say No) attack, which achieves successful attack by suppressing refusal. Another challenge in studying jailbreak attacks is the evaluation, as it is difficult to directly and accurately assess the harmfulness of the responses. The existing evaluation such as refusal keyword matching reveals numerous false positive and false negative instances. To overcome this challenge, we propose an Ensemble Evaluation pipeline that novelly incorporates Natural Language Inference (NLI) contradiction assessment and two external LLM evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the potential of the DSN and effectiveness of Ensemble Evaluation compared to baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16369v2,2024-04
Learning Syntax Without Planting Trees: Understanding When and Why Transformers Generalize Hierarchically,"Kabir Ahuja, Vidhisha Balachandran, Madhur Panwar, Tianxing He, Noah A. Smith, Navin Goyal, Yulia Tsvetkov","Transformers trained on natural language data have been shown to learn its hierarchical structure and generalize to sentences with unseen syntactic structures without explicitly encoding any structural bias. In this work, we investigate sources of inductive bias in transformer models and their training that could cause such generalization behavior to emerge. We extensively experiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and with different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g. sequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead to hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling objective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct pruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language modeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint existence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization behaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear order). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover transformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a correlation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset and whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a hierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16367v2,2024-04
VISLA Benchmark: Evaluating Embedding Sensitivity to Semantic and Lexical Alterations,"Sri Harsha Dumpala, Aman Jaiswal, Chandramouli Sastry, Evangelos Milios, Sageev Oore, Hassan Sajjad","Despite their remarkable successes, state-of-the-art language models face challenges in grasping certain important semantic details. This paper introduces the VISLA (Variance and Invariance to Semantic and Lexical Alterations) benchmark, designed to evaluate the semantic and lexical understanding of language models. VISLA presents a 3-way semantic (in)equivalence task with a triplet of sentences associated with an image, to evaluate both vision-language models (VLMs) and unimodal language models (ULMs). An evaluation involving 34 VLMs and 20 ULMs reveals surprising difficulties in distinguishing between lexical and semantic variations. Spatial semantics encoded by language models also appear to be highly sensitive to lexical information. Notably, text encoders of VLMs demonstrate greater sensitivity to semantic and lexical variations than unimodal text encoders. Our contributions include the unification of image-to-text and text-to-text retrieval tasks, an off-the-shelf evaluation without fine-tuning, and assessing LMs' semantic (in)variance in the presence of lexical alterations. The results highlight strengths and weaknesses across diverse vision and unimodal language models, contributing to a deeper understanding of their capabilities. % VISLA enables a rigorous evaluation, shedding light on language models' capabilities in handling semantic and lexical nuances.

PILA: A Historical-Linguistic Dataset of Proto-Italic and Latin,"Stephen Bothwell, Brian DuSell, David Chiang, Brian Krostenko","Computational historical linguistics seeks to systematically understand processes of sound change, including during periods at which little to no formal recording of language is attested. At the same time, few computational resources exist which deeply explore phonological and morphological connections between proto-languages and their descendants. This is particularly true for the family of Italic languages. To assist historical linguists in the study of Italic sound change, we introduce the Proto-Italic to Latin (PILA) dataset, which consists of roughly 3,000 pairs of forms from Proto-Italic and Latin. We provide a detailed description of how our dataset was created and organized. Then, we exhibit PILA's value in two ways. First, we present baseline results for PILA on a pair of traditional computational historical linguistics tasks.

Digital ASIC Design with Ongoing LLMs: Strategies and Prospects,"Maoyang Xiang, Emil Goh, T. Hui Teo","The escalating complexity of modern digital systems has imposed significant challenges on integrated circuit (IC) design, necessitating tools that can simplify the IC design flow. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been seen as a promising development, with the potential to automate the generation of Hardware Description Language (HDL) code, thereby streamlining digital IC design. However, the practical application of LLMs in this area faces substantial hurdles. Notably, current LLMs often generate HDL code with small but critical syntax errors and struggle to accurately convey the high-level semantics of circuit designs. These issues significantly undermine the utility of LLMs for IC design, leading to misinterpretations and inefficiencies.   In response to these challenges, this paper presents targeted strategies to harness the capabilities of LLMs for digital ASIC design. We outline approaches that improve the reliability and accuracy of HDL code generation by LLMs. As a practical demonstration of these strategies, we detail the development of a simple three-phase Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) generator. This project, part of the ""Efabless AI-Generated Open-Source Chip Design Challenge,"" successfully passed the Design Rule Check (DRC) and was fabricated, showcasing the potential of LLMs to enhance digital ASIC design. This work underscores the feasibility and benefits of integrating LLMs into the IC design process, offering a novel approach to overcoming the complexities of modern digital systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02329v1,2024-04

WorldValuesBench: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Multi-Cultural Value Awareness of Language Models,"Wenlong Zhao, Debanjan Mondal, Niket Tandon, Danica Dillion, Kurt Gray, Yuling Gu","The awareness of multi-cultural human values is critical to the ability of language models (LMs) to generate safe and personalized responses. However, this awareness of LMs has been insufficiently studied, since the computer science community lacks access to the large-scale real-world data about multi-cultural values. In this paper, we present WorldValuesBench, a globally diverse, large-scale benchmark dataset for the multi-cultural value prediction task, which requires a model to generate a rating response to a value question based on demographic contexts. Our dataset is derived from an influential social science project, World Values Survey (WVS), that has collected answers to hundreds of value questions (e.g., social, economic, ethical) from 94,728 participants worldwide. We have constructed more than 20 million examples of the type ""(demographic attributes, value question) $\rightarrow$ answer"" from the WVS responses. We perform a case study using our dataset and show that the task is challenging for strong open and closed-source models. On merely $11.1\%$, $25.0\%$, $72.2\%$, and $75.0\%$ of the questions, Alpaca-7B, Vicuna-7B-v1.5, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, and GPT-3.5 Turbo can respectively achieve $<0.2$ Wasserstein 1-distance from the human normalized answer distributions.

LLM-Based Section Identifiers Excel on Open Source but Stumble in Real World Applications,"Saranya Krishnamoorthy, Ayush Singh, Shabnam Tafreshi","Electronic health records (EHR) even though a boon for healthcare practitioners, are growing convoluted and longer every day. Sifting around these lengthy EHRs is taxing and becomes a cumbersome part of physician-patient interaction. Several approaches have been proposed to help alleviate this prevalent issue either via summarization or sectioning, however, only a few approaches have truly been helpful in the past. With the rise of automated methods, machine learning (ML) has shown promise in solving the task of identifying relevant sections in EHR. However, most ML methods rely on labeled data which is difficult to get in healthcare. Large language models (LLMs) on the other hand, have performed impressive feats in natural language processing (NLP), that too in a zero-shot manner, i.e. without any labeled data. To that end, we propose using LLMs to identify relevant section headers. We find that GPT-4 can effectively solve the task on both zero and few-shot settings as well as segment dramatically better than state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we also annotate a much harder real world dataset and find that GPT-4 struggles to perform well, alluding to further research and harder benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16294v1,2024-04

Translation of Multifaceted Data without Re-Training of Machine Translation Systems,"Hyeonseok Moon, Seungyoon Lee, Seongtae Hong, Seungjun Lee, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim","Translating major language resources to build minor language resources becomes a widely-used approach. Particularly in translating complex data points composed of multiple components, it is common to translate each component separately. However, we argue that this practice often overlooks the interrelation between components within the same data point. To address this limitation, we propose a novel MT pipeline that considers the intra-data relation in implementing MT for training data. In our MT pipeline, all the components in a data point are concatenated to form a single translation sequence and subsequently reconstructed to the data components after translation. We introduce a Catalyst Statement (CS) to enhance the intra-data relation, and Indicator Token (IT) to assist the decomposition of a translated sequence into its respective data components. Through our approach, we have achieved a considerable improvement in translation quality itself, along with its effectiveness as training data. Compared with the conventional approach that translates each data component separately, our method yields better training data that enhances the performance of the trained model by 2.690 points for the web page ranking (WPR) task, and 0.845 for the question generation (QG) task in the XGLUE benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16257v2,2024-04

Fabbri, Ben Risher, Philippe Laban, Shafiq Joty, Chien-Sheng Wu","Prompt leakage poses a compelling security and privacy threat in LLM applications. Leakage of system prompts may compromise intellectual property, and act as adversarial reconnaissance for an attacker. A systematic evaluation of prompt leakage threats and mitigation strategies is lacking, especially for multi-turn LLM interactions. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLM vulnerabilities against prompt leakage for 10 closed- and open-source LLMs, across four domains. We design a unique threat model which leverages the LLM sycophancy effect and elevates the average attack success rate (ASR) from 17.7% to 86.2% in a multi-turn setting. Our standardized setup further allows dissecting leakage of specific prompt contents such as task instructions and knowledge documents. We measure the mitigation effect of 7 black-box defense strategies, along with finetuning an open-source model to defend against leakage attempts.

Current studies are limited to specific tasks like information retrieval or semantic matching, where the claim-reference relationships are unique and fixed, while the referential knowledge linking (RKL) in real-world can be much more diverse and complex. In this paper, we propose universal referential knowledge linking (URL), which aims to resolve diversified referential knowledge linking tasks by one unified model. To this end, we propose a LLM-driven task-instructed representation compression, as well as a multi-view learning approach, in order to effectively adapt the instruction following and semantic understanding abilities of LLMs to referential knowledge linking. Furthermore, we also construct a new benchmark to evaluate ability of models on referential knowledge linking tasks across different scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that universal RKL is challenging for existing approaches, while the proposed framework can effectively resolve the task across various scenarios, and therefore outperforms previous approaches by a large margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16248v1,2024-04
Computational analysis of the language of pain: a systematic review,"Diogo A. P. Nunes, Joana Ferreira-Gomes, Fani Neto, David Martins de Matos","Objectives: This study aims to systematically review the literature on the computational processing of the language of pain, or pain narratives, whether generated by patients or physicians, identifying current trends and challenges. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted to select relevant studies on the computational processing of the language of pain and answer pre-defined research questions. Data extraction and synthesis were performed to categorize selected studies according to their primary purpose and outcome, patient and pain population, textual data, computational methodology, and outcome targets. Results: Physician-generated language of pain, specifically from clinical notes, was the most used data. Tasks included patient diagnosis and triaging, identification of pain mentions, treatment response prediction, biomedical entity extraction, correlation of linguistic features with clinical states, and lexico-semantic analysis of pain narratives. Only one study included previous linguistic knowledge on pain utterances in their experimental setup. Most studies targeted their outcomes for physicians, either directly as clinical tools or as indirect knowledge. The least targeted stage of clinical pain care was self-management, in which patients are most involved. Affective and sociocultural dimensions were the least studied domains. Only one study measured how physician performance on clinical tasks improved with the inclusion of the proposed algorithm. Discussion: This review found that future research should focus on analyzing patient-generated language of pain, developing patient-centered resources for self-management and patient-empowerment, exploring affective and sociocultural aspects of pain, and measuring improvements in physician performance when aided by the proposed tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16226v2,2024-04
Homonym Sense Disambiguation in the Georgian Language,"Davit Melikidze, Alexander Gamkrelidze","This research proposes a novel approach to the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task in the Georgian language, based on supervised fine-tuning of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) on a dataset formed by filtering the Georgian Common Crawls corpus. The dataset is used to train a classifier for words with multiple senses. Additionally, we present experimental results of using LSTM for WSD. Accurately disambiguating homonyms is crucial in natural language processing. Georgian, an agglutinative language belonging to the Kartvelian language family, presents unique challenges in this context. The aim of this paper is to highlight the specific problems concerning homonym disambiguation in the Georgian language and to present our approach to solving them. The techniques discussed in the article achieve 95% accuracy for predicting lexical meanings of homonyms using a hand-classified dataset of over 7500 sentences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00710v1,2024-04
Knowledge Graph Completion using Structural and Textual Embeddings,"Sakher Khalil Alqaaidi, Krzysztof Kochut","Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are widely employed in artificial intelligence applications, such as question-answering and recommendation systems. However, KGs are frequently found to be incomplete. While much of the existing literature focuses on predicting missing nodes for given incomplete KG triples, there remains an opportunity to complete KGs by exploring relations between existing nodes, a task known as relation prediction. In this study, we propose a relations prediction model that harnesses both textual and structural information within KGs. Our approach integrates walks-based embeddings with language model embeddings to effectively represent nodes. We demonstrate that our model achieves competitive results in the relation prediction task when evaluated on a widely used dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16206v1,2024-04
Using Artificial Intelligence to Unlock Crowdfunding Success for Small Businesses,"Teng Ye, Jingnan Zheng, Junhui Jin, Jingyi Qiu, Wei Ai, Qiaozhu Mei","While small businesses are increasingly turning to online crowdfunding platforms for essential funding, over 40% of these campaigns may fail to raise any money, especially those from low socio-economic areas. We utilize the latest advancements in AI technology to identify crucial factors that influence the success of crowdfunding campaigns and to improve their fundraising outcomes by strategically optimizing these factors. Our best-performing machine learning model accurately predicts the fundraising outcomes of 81.0% of campaigns, primarily based on their textual descriptions. Interpreting the machine learning model allows us to provide actionable suggestions on improving the textual description before launching a campaign. We demonstrate that by augmenting just three aspects of the narrative using a large language model, a campaign becomes more preferable to 83% human evaluators, and its likelihood of securing financial support increases by 11.9%. Our research uncovers the effective strategies for crafting descriptions for small business fundraising campaigns and opens up a new realm in integrating large language models into crowdfunding methodologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09480v1,2024-04
Towards Efficient Patient Recruitment for Clinical Trials: Application of a Prompt-Based Learning Model,"Mojdeh Rahmanian, Seyed Mostafa Fakhrahmad, Seyedeh Zahra Mousavi","Objective: Clinical trials are essential for advancing pharmaceutical interventions, but they face a bottleneck in selecting eligible participants. Although leveraging electronic health records (EHR) for recruitment has gained popularity, the complex nature of unstructured medical texts presents challenges in efficiently identifying participants. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have emerged as a solution with a recent focus on transformer models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a prompt-based large language model for the cohort selection task from unstructured medical notes collected in the EHR. Methods: To process the medical records, we selected the most related sentences of the records to the eligibility criteria needed for the trial. The SNOMED CT concepts related to each eligibility criterion were collected. Medical records were also annotated with MedCAT based on the SNOMED CT ontology. Annotated sentences including concepts matched with the criteria-relevant terms were extracted. A prompt-based large language model (Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) in this study) was then used with the extracted sentences as the training set. To assess its effectiveness, we evaluated the model's performance using the dataset from the 2018 n2c2 challenge, which aimed to classify medical records of 311 patients based on 13 eligibility criteria through NLP techniques. Results: Our proposed model showed the overall micro and macro F measures of 0.9061 and 0.8060 which were among the highest scores achieved by the experiments performed with this dataset. Conclusion: The application of a prompt-based large language model in this study to classify patients based on eligibility criteria received promising scores. Besides, we proposed a method of extractive summarization with the aid of SNOMED CT ontology that can be also applied to other medical texts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16198v1,2024-04
Fusion of Domain-Adapted Vision and Language Models for Medical Visual Question Answering,"Cuong Nhat Ha, Shima Asaadi, Sanjeev Kumar Karn, Oladimeji Farri, Tobias Heimann, Thomas Runkler","Vision-language models, while effective in general domains and showing strong performance in diverse multi-modal applications like visual question-answering (VQA), struggle to maintain the same level of effectiveness in more specialized domains, e.g., medical. We propose a medical vision-language model that integrates large vision and language models adapted for the medical domain. This model goes through three stages of parameter-efficient training using three separate biomedical and radiology multi-modal visual and text datasets. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SLAKE 1.0 medical VQA (MedVQA) dataset with an overall accuracy of 87.5% and demonstrates strong performance on another MedVQA dataset, VQA-RAD, achieving an overall accuracy of 73.2%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16192v1,2024-04
Lessons from the Use of Natural Language Inference (NLI) in Requirements Engineering Tasks,"Mohamad Fazelnia, Viktoria Koscinski, Spencer Herzog, Mehdi Mirakhorli","We investigate the use of Natural Language Inference (NLI) in automating requirements engineering tasks. In particular, we focus on three tasks: requirements classification, identification of requirements specification defects, and detection of conflicts in stakeholders' requirements. While previous research has demonstrated significant benefit in using NLI as a universal method for a broad spectrum of natural language processing tasks, these advantages have not been investigated within the context of software requirements engineering. Therefore, we design experiments to evaluate the use of NLI in requirements analysis. We compare the performance of NLI with a spectrum of approaches, including prompt-based models, conventional transfer learning, Large Language Models (LLMs)-powered chatbot models, and probabilistic models. Through experiments conducted under various learning settings including conventional learning and zero-shot, we demonstrate conclusively that our NLI method surpasses classical NLP methods as well as other LLMs-based and chatbot models in the analysis of requirements specifications. Additionally, we share lessons learned characterizing the learning settings that make NLI a suitable approach for automating requirements engineering tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05135v1,2024-04
Towards a Holistic Evaluation of LLMs on Factual Knowledge Recall,"Jiaqing Yuan, Lin Pan, Chung-Wei Hang, Jiang Guo, Jiarong Jiang, Bonan Min, Patrick Ng, Zhiguo Wang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on a variety of NLP tasks, and are being rapidly adopted in a wide range of use cases. It is therefore of vital importance to holistically evaluate the factuality of their generated outputs, as hallucinations remain a challenging issue.   In this work, we focus on assessing LLMs' ability to recall factual knowledge learned from pretraining, and the factors that affect this ability. To that end, we construct FACT-BENCH, a representative benchmark covering 20 domains, 134 property types, 3 answer types, and different knowledge popularity levels. We benchmark 31 models from 10 model families and provide a holistic assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. We observe that instruction-tuning hurts knowledge recall, as pretraining-only models consistently outperform their instruction-tuned counterparts, and positive effects of model scaling, as larger models outperform smaller ones for all model families. However, the best performance from GPT-4 still represents a large gap with the upper-bound. We additionally study the role of in-context exemplars using counterfactual demonstrations, which lead to significant degradation of factual knowledge recall for large models. By further decoupling model known and unknown knowledge, we find the degradation is attributed to exemplars that contradict a model's known knowledge, as well as the number of such exemplars. Lastly, we fine-tune LLaMA-7B in different settings of known and unknown knowledge. In particular, fine-tuning on a model's known knowledge is beneficial, and consistently outperforms fine-tuning on unknown and mixed knowledge. We will make our benchmark publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16164v1,2024-04
Domain-Specific Improvement on Psychotherapy Chatbot Using Assistant,"Cheng Kang, Daniel Novak, Katerina Urbanova, Yuqing Cheng, Yong Hu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities on specific tasks with human-written instruction data. However, the limited quantity, diversity, and professional expertise of such instruction data raise concerns about the performance of LLMs in psychotherapy tasks when provided with domain-specific instructions. To address this, we firstly propose Domain-Specific Assistant Instructions based on AlexanderStreet therapy, and secondly, we use an adaption fine-tuning method and retrieval augmented generation method to improve pre-trained LLMs. Through quantitative evaluation of linguistic quality using automatic and human evaluation, we observe that pre-trained LLMs on Psychotherapy Assistant Instructions outperform state-of-the-art LLMs response baselines. Our Assistant-Instruction approach offers a half-annotation method to align pre-trained LLMs with instructions and provide pre-trained LLMs with more psychotherapy knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16160v2,2024-04
Attacks on Third-Party APIs of Large Language Models,"Wanru Zhao, Vidit Khazanchi, Haodi Xing, Xuanli He, Qiongkai Xu, Nicholas Donald Lane","Large language model (LLM) services have recently begun offering a plugin ecosystem to interact with third-party API services. This innovation enhances the capabilities of LLMs, but it also introduces risks, as these plugins developed by various third parties cannot be easily trusted. This paper proposes a new attacking framework to examine security and safety vulnerabilities within LLM platforms that incorporate third-party services. Applying our framework specifically to widely used LLMs, we identify real-world malicious attacks across various domains on third-party APIs that can imperceptibly modify LLM outputs. The paper discusses the unique challenges posed by third-party API integration and offers strategic possibilities to improve the security and safety of LLM ecosystems moving forward.

From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization,"Darren Edge, Ha Trinh, Newman Cheng, Joshua Bradley, Alex Chao, Apurva Mody, Steven Truitt, Jonathan Larson","The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as ""What are the main themes in the dataset?"", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be indexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages: first to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na\""ive RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16130v1,2024-04
FairDeDup: Detecting and Mitigating Vision-Language Fairness Disparities in Semantic Dataset Deduplication,"Eric Slyman, Stefan Lee, Scott Cohen, Kushal Kafle","Recent dataset deduplication techniques have demonstrated that content-aware dataset pruning can dramatically reduce the cost of training Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models without significant performance losses compared to training on the original dataset. These results have been based on pruning commonly used image-caption datasets collected from the web -- datasets that are known to harbor harmful social biases that may then be codified in trained models. In this work, we evaluate how deduplication affects the prevalence of these biases in the resulting trained models and introduce an easy-to-implement modification to the recent SemDeDup algorithm that can reduce the negative effects that we observe. When examining CLIP-style models trained on deduplicated variants of LAION-400M, we find our proposed FairDeDup algorithm consistently leads to improved fairness metrics over SemDeDup on the FairFace and FACET datasets while maintaining zero-shot performance on CLIP benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16123v1,2024-04
Integrating LSTM and BERT for Long-Sequence Data Analysis in Intelligent Tutoring Systems,"Zhaoxing Li, Jujie Yang, Jindi Wang, Lei Shi, Sebastian Stein","The field of Knowledge Tracing aims to understand how students learn and master knowledge over time by analyzing their historical behaviour data. To achieve this goal, many researchers have proposed Knowledge Tracing models that use data from Intelligent Tutoring Systems to predict students' subsequent actions. However, with the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems, large-scale datasets containing long-sequence data began to emerge. Recent deep learning based Knowledge Tracing models face obstacles such as low efficiency, low accuracy, and low interpretability when dealing with large-scale datasets containing long-sequence data. To address these issues and promote the sustainable development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems, we propose a LSTM BERT-based Knowledge Tracing model for long sequence data processing, namely LBKT, which uses a BERT-based architecture with a Rasch model-based embeddings block to deal with different difficulty levels information and an LSTM block to process the sequential characteristic in students' actions. LBKT achieves the best performance on most benchmark datasets on the metrics of ACC and AUC. Additionally, an ablation study is conducted to analyse the impact of each component of LBKT's overall performance. Moreover, we used t-SNE as the visualisation tool to demonstrate the model's embedding strategy. The results indicate that LBKT is faster, more interpretable, and has a lower memory cost than the traditional deep learning based Knowledge Tracing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05136v1,2024-04
Classifying Human-Generated and AI-Generated Election Claims in Social Media,"Alphaeus Dmonte, Marcos Zampieri, Kevin Lybarger, Massimiliano Albanese, Genya Coulter","Politics is one of the most prevalent topics discussed on social media platforms, particularly during major election cycles, where users engage in conversations about candidates and electoral processes. Malicious actors may use this opportunity to disseminate misinformation to undermine trust in the electoral process. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) exacerbates this issue by enabling malicious actors to generate misinformation at an unprecedented scale. Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content is often indistinguishable from authentic user content, raising concerns about the integrity of information on social networks. In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy for characterizing election-related claims. This taxonomy provides an instrument for analyzing election-related claims, with granular categories related to jurisdiction, equipment, processes, and the nature of claims. We introduce ElectAI, a novel benchmark dataset that consists of 9,900 tweets, each labeled as human- or AI-generated. For AI-generated tweets, the specific LLM variant that produced them is specified. We annotated a subset of 1,550 tweets using the proposed taxonomy to capture the characteristics of election-related claims. We explored the capabilities of LLMs in extracting the taxonomy attributes and trained various machine learning models using ElectAI to distinguish between human- and AI-generated posts and identify the specific LLM variant.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16116v2,2024-04

This study introduces an innovative online method that employs neural bandit algorithms to dynamically optimize soft instruction embeddings based on user feedback, enhancing the personalization of open-ended text generation by white-box LLMs. Through rigorous experimentation on various tasks, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline strategies. NeuralTS, in particular, leads to substantial enhancements in personalized news headline generation, achieving up to a 62.9% improvement in terms of best ROUGE scores and up to 2.76% increase in LLM-agent evaluation against the baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16115v1,2024-04
Evolution of Voices in French Audiovisual Media Across Genders and Age in a Diachronic Perspective,"Albert Rilliard, David Doukhan, Rémi Uro, Simon Devauchelle","We present a diachronic acoustic analysis of the voice of 1023 speakers from French media archives. The speakers are spread across 32 categories based on four periods (years 1955/56, 1975/76, 1995/96, 2015/16), four age groups (20-35; 36-50; 51-65, >65), and two genders. The fundamental frequency ($F_0$) and the first four formants (F1-4) were estimated. Procedures used to ensure the quality of these estimations on heterogeneous data are described. From each speaker's $F_0$ distribution, the base-$F_0$ value was calculated to estimate the register. Average vocal tract length was estimated from formant frequencies. Base-$F_0$ and vocal tract length were fit by linear mixed models to evaluate how they may have changed across time periods and genders, corrected for age effects. Results show an effect of the period with a tendency to lower voices, independently of gender. A lowering of pitch is observed with age for female but not male speakers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16104v1,2024-04
Cantor: Inspiring Multimodal Chain-of-Thought of MLLM,"Timin Gao, Peixian Chen, Mengdan Zhang, Chaoyou Fu, Yunhang Shen, Yan Zhang, Shengchuan Zhang, Xiawu Zheng, Xing Sun, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji","With the advent of large language models(LLMs) enhanced by the chain-of-thought(CoT) methodology, visual reasoning problem is usually decomposed into manageable sub-tasks and tackled sequentially with various external tools. However, such a paradigm faces the challenge of the potential ""determining hallucinations"" in decision-making due to insufficient visual information and the limitation of low-level perception tools that fail to provide abstract summaries necessary for comprehensive reasoning. We argue that converging visual context acquisition and logical reasoning is pivotal for tackling visual reasoning tasks. This paper delves into the realm of multimodal CoT to solve intricate visual reasoning tasks with multimodal large language models(MLLMs) and their cognitive capability. To this end, we propose an innovative multimodal CoT framework, termed Cantor, characterized by a perception-decision architecture. Cantor first acts as a decision generator and integrates visual inputs to analyze the image and problem, ensuring a closer alignment with the actual context. Furthermore, Cantor leverages the advanced cognitive functions of MLLMs to perform as multifaceted experts for deriving higher-level information, enhancing the CoT generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, showing significant improvements in multimodal CoT performance across two complex visual reasoning datasets, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.

MoDE: CLIP Data Experts via Clustering,"Jiawei Ma, Po-Yao Huang, Saining Xie, Shang-Wen Li, Luke Zettlemoyer, Shih-Fu Chang, Wen-Tau Yih, Hu Xu","The success of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) relies on the supervision from the pairing between images and captions, which tends to be noisy in web-crawled data. We present Mixture of Data Experts (MoDE) and learn a system of CLIP data experts via clustering. Each data expert is trained on one data cluster, being less sensitive to false negative noises in other clusters. At inference time, we ensemble their outputs by applying weights determined through the correlation between task metadata and cluster conditions. To estimate the correlation precisely, the samples in one cluster should be semantically similar, but the number of data experts should still be reasonable for training and inference. As such, we consider the ontology in human language and propose to use fine-grained cluster centers to represent each data expert at a coarse-grained level. Experimental studies show that four CLIP data experts on ViT-B/16 outperform the ViT-L/14 by OpenAI CLIP and OpenCLIP on zero-shot image classification but with less ($<$35\%) training cost. Meanwhile, MoDE can train all data expert asynchronously and can flexibly include new data experts.

Universal Adversarial Triggers Are Not Universal,"Nicholas Meade, Arkil Patel, Siva Reddy","Recent work has developed optimization procedures to find token sequences, called adversarial triggers, which can elicit unsafe responses from aligned language models. These triggers are believed to be universally transferable, i.e., a trigger optimized on one model can jailbreak other models. In this paper, we concretely show that such adversarial triggers are not universal. We extensively investigate trigger transfer amongst 13 open models and observe inconsistent transfer. Our experiments further reveal a significant difference in robustness to adversarial triggers between models Aligned by Preference Optimization (APO) and models Aligned by Fine-Tuning (AFT). We find that APO models are extremely hard to jailbreak even when the trigger is optimized directly on the model. On the other hand, while AFT models may appear safe on the surface, exhibiting refusals to a range of unsafe instructions, we show that they are highly susceptible to adversarial triggers. Lastly, we observe that most triggers optimized on AFT models also generalize to new unsafe instructions from five diverse domains, further emphasizing their vulnerability. Overall, our work highlights the need for more comprehensive safety evaluations for aligned language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16020v1,2024-04

Hale","Human feedback is central to the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, open questions remain about methods (how), domains (where), people (who) and objectives (to what end) of feedback processes. To navigate these questions, we introduce PRISM, a dataset that maps the sociodemographics and stated preferences of 1,500 diverse participants from 75 countries, to their contextual preferences and fine-grained feedback in 8,011 live conversations with 21 LLMs. With PRISM, we contribute (i) wider geographic and demographic participation in feedback; (ii) census-representative samples for two countries (UK, US); and (iii) individualised ratings that link to detailed participant profiles, permitting personalisation and attribution of sample artefacts. We target subjective and multicultural perspectives on value-laden and controversial issues, where we expect interpersonal and cross-cultural disagreement.

Uncertainty Estimation and Quantification for LLMs: A Simple Supervised Approach,"Linyu Liu, Yu Pan, Xiaocheng Li, Guanting Chen","In this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty estimation and calibration for LLMs. We begin by formulating the uncertainty estimation problem, a relevant yet underexplored area in existing literature. We then propose a supervised approach that leverages labeled datasets to estimate the uncertainty in LLMs' responses. Based on the formulation, we illustrate the difference between the uncertainty estimation for LLMs and that for standard ML models and explain why the hidden neurons of the LLMs may contain uncertainty information. Our designed approach demonstrates the benefits of utilizing hidden activations to enhance uncertainty estimation across various tasks and shows robust transferability in out-of-distribution settings. We distinguish the uncertainty estimation task from the uncertainty calibration task and show that better uncertainty estimation leads to better calibration performance. Furthermore, our method is easy to implement and adaptable to different levels of model accessibility including black box, grey box, and white box.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15993v4,2024-04
CORM: Cache Optimization with Recent Message for Large Language Model Inference,"Jincheng Dai, Zhuowei Huang, Haiyun Jiang, Chen Chen, Deng Cai, Wei Bi, Shuming Shi","Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, necessitate substantial GPU memory and consume significant computational resources. Beyond the memory taken up by model weights, the memory used by the KV cache rises linearly with sequence length, becoming a primary bottleneck for inference. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method for optimizing the KV cache, which considerably minimizes its memory footprint. Upon thorough investigation, we discover that in most Transformer models, (i) there is a striking similarity between adjacent tokens' query vectors, and (ii) the attention calculation of the current query can rely exclusively on the attention information of a small fraction of preceding queries. Based on these observations, we present CORM, a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains essential key-value pairs for inference without the need for model fine-tuning. Our validation shows that CORM reduces the inference memory usage of KV cache by up to 70\% with negligible performance degradation across six tasks in LongBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CORM is compatible with GQA for further compression rate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15949v2,2024-04
Generalization Measures for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer,"Saksham Bassi, Duygu Ataman, Kyunghyun Cho","A model's capacity to generalize its knowledge to interpret unseen inputs with different characteristics is crucial to build robust and reliable machine learning systems. Language model evaluation tasks lack information metrics about model generalization and their applicability in a new setting is measured using task and language-specific downstream performance, which is often lacking in many languages and tasks. In this paper, we explore a set of efficient and reliable measures that could aid in computing more information related to the generalization capability of language models in cross-lingual zero-shot settings. In addition to traditional measures such as variance in parameters after training and distance from initialization, we also measure the effectiveness of sharpness in loss landscape in capturing the success in cross-lingual transfer and propose a novel and stable algorithm to reliably compute the sharpness of a model optimum that correlates to generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15928v2,2024-04
Inside the echo chamber: Linguistic underpinnings of misinformation on Twitter,"Xinyu Wang, Jiayi Li, Sarah Rajtmajer","Social media users drive the spread of misinformation online by sharing posts that include erroneous information or commenting on controversial topics with unsubstantiated arguments often in earnest. Work on echo chambers has suggested that users' perspectives are reinforced through repeated interactions with like-minded peers, promoted by homophily and bias in information diffusion. Building on long-standing interest in the social bases of language and linguistic underpinnings of social behavior, this work explores how conversations around misinformation are mediated through language use. We compare a number of linguistic measures, e.g., in-/out-group cues, readability, and discourse connectives, within and across topics of conversation and user communities. Our findings reveal increased presence of group identity signals and processing fluency within echo chambers during discussions of misinformation. We discuss the specific character of these broader trends across topics and examine contextual influences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15925v1,2024-04
KGValidator: A Framework for Automatic Validation of Knowledge Graph Construction,"Jack Boylan, Shashank Mangla, Dominic Thorn, Demian Gholipour Ghalandari, Parsa Ghaffari, Chris Hokamp","This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic evaluation of knowledge graph (KG) completion models. Historically, validating information in KGs has been a challenging task, requiring large-scale human annotation at prohibitive cost. With the emergence of general-purpose generative AI and LLMs, it is now plausible that human-in-the-loop validation could be replaced by a generative agent. We introduce a framework for consistency and validation when using generative models to validate knowledge graphs. Our framework is based upon recent open-source developments for structural and semantic validation of LLM outputs, and upon flexible approaches to fact checking and verification, supported by the capacity to reference external knowledge sources of any kind. The design is easy to adapt and extend, and can be used to verify any kind of graph-structured data through a combination of model-intrinsic knowledge, user-supplied context, and agents capable of external knowledge retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15923v1,2024-04
Assessing The Potential Of Mid-Sized Language Models For Clinical QA,"Elliot Bolton, Betty Xiong, Vijaytha Muralidharan, Joel Schamroth, Vivek Muralidharan, Christopher D. Manning, Roxana Daneshjou","Large language models, such as GPT-4 and Med-PaLM, have shown impressive performance on clinical tasks; however, they require access to compute, are closed-source, and cannot be deployed on device. Mid-size models such as BioGPT-large, BioMedLM, LLaMA 2, and Mistral 7B avoid these drawbacks, but their capacity for clinical tasks has been understudied. To help assess their potential for clinical use and help researchers decide which model they should use, we compare their performance on two clinical question-answering (QA) tasks: MedQA and consumer query answering. We find that Mistral 7B is the best performing model, winning on all benchmarks and outperforming models trained specifically for the biomedical domain. While Mistral 7B's MedQA score of 63.0% approaches the original Med-PaLM, and it often can produce plausible responses to consumer health queries, room for improvement still exists. This study provides the first head-to-head assessment of open source mid-sized models on clinical tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15894v1,2024-04
Effective Unsupervised Constrained Text Generation based on Perturbed Masking,"Yingwen Fu, Wenjie Ou, Zhou Yu, Yue Lin","Unsupervised constrained text generation aims to generate text under a given set of constraints without any supervised data. Current state-of-the-art methods stochastically sample edit positions and actions, which may cause unnecessary search steps. In this paper, we propose PMCTG to improve effectiveness by searching for the best edit position and action in each step. Specifically, PMCTG extends perturbed masking technique to effectively search for the most incongruent token to edit. Then it introduces four multi-aspect scoring functions to select edit action to further reduce search difficulty. Since PMCTG does not require supervised data, it could be applied to different generation tasks. We show that under the unsupervised setting, PMCTG achieves new state-of-the-art results in two representative tasks, namely keywords-to-sentence generation and paraphrasing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15877v1,2024-04
Detecting Conceptual Abstraction in LLMs,"Michaela Regneri, Alhassan Abdelhalim, Sören Laue","We present a novel approach to detecting noun abstraction within a large language model (LLM). Starting from a psychologically motivated set of noun pairs in taxonomic relationships, we instantiate surface patterns indicating hypernymy and analyze the attention matrices produced by BERT. We compare the results to two sets of counterfactuals and show that we can detect hypernymy in the abstraction mechanism, which cannot solely be related to the distributional similarity of noun pairs. Our findings are a first step towards the explainability of conceptual abstraction in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15848v2,2024-04
From Complex to Simple: Enhancing Multi-Constraint Complex Instruction Following Ability of Large Language Models,"Qianyu He, Jie Zeng, Qianxi He, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao","It is imperative for Large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions with elaborate requirements (i.e. Complex Instructions Following). Yet, it remains under-explored how to enhance the ability of LLMs to follow complex instructions with multiple constraints. To bridge the gap, we initially study what training data is effective in enhancing complex constraints following abilities. We found that training LLMs with instructions containing multiple constraints enhances their understanding of complex instructions, especially those with lower complexity levels. The improvement can even generalize to compositions of out-of-domain constraints. Additionally, we further propose methods addressing how to obtain and utilize the effective training data. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to prove the effectiveness of our methods in terms of overall performance and training efficiency. We also demonstrate that our methods improve models' ability to follow instructions generally and generalize effectively across out-of-domain, in-domain, and adversarial settings, while maintaining general capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15846v2,2024-04
Exploring LLM Prompting Strategies for Joint Essay Scoring and Feedback Generation,"Maja Stahl, Leon Biermann, Andreas Nehring, Henning Wachsmuth","Individual feedback can help students improve their essay writing skills. However, the manual effort required to provide such feedback limits individualization in practice. Automatically-generated essay feedback may serve as an alternative to guide students at their own pace, convenience, and desired frequency. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. Yet, their ability to provide helpful essay feedback is unclear. This work explores several prompting strategies for LLM-based zero-shot and few-shot generation of essay feedback. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought prompting, we study how and to what extent automated essay scoring (AES) can benefit the quality of generated feedback. We evaluate both the AES performance that LLMs can achieve with prompting only and the helpfulness of the generated essay feedback. Our results suggest that tackling AES and feedback generation jointly improves AES performance. However, while our manual evaluation emphasizes the quality of the generated essay feedback, the impact of essay scoring on the generated feedback remains low ultimately.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15845v1,2024-04
BERT vs GPT for financial engineering,"Edward Sharkey, Philip Treleaven","The paper benchmarks several Transformer models [4], to show how these models can judge sentiment from a news event. This signal can then be used for downstream modelling and signal identification for commodity trading. We find that fine-tuned BERT models outperform fine-tuned or vanilla GPT models on this task. Transformer models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art results on various tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and natural language generation. Among the most prominent transformer models are Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which differ in their architectures and objectives.   A CopBERT model training data and process overview is provided. The CopBERT model outperforms similar domain specific BERT trained models such as FinBERT. The below confusion matrices show the performance on CopBERT & CopGPT respectively. We see a ~10 percent increase in f1_score when compare CopBERT vs GPT4 and 16 percent increase vs CopGPT. Whilst GPT4 is dominant It highlights the importance of considering alternatives to GPT models for financial engineering tasks, given risks of hallucinations, and challenges with interpretability. We unsurprisingly see the larger LLMs outperform the BERT models, with predictive power. In summary BERT is partially the new XGboost, what it lacks in predictive power it provides with higher levels of interpretability. Concluding that BERT models might not be the next XGboost [2], but represent an interesting alternative for financial engineering tasks, that require a blend of interpretability and accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12990v1,2024-04
One Subgraph for All: Efficient Reasoning on Opening Subgraphs for Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion,"Zhiwen Xie, Yi Zhang, Guangyou Zhou, Jin Liu, Xinhui Tu, Jimmy Xiangji Huang","Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has garnered massive research interest recently, and most existing methods are designed following a transductive setting where all entities are observed during training. Despite the great progress on the transductive KGC, these methods struggle to conduct reasoning on emerging KGs involving unseen entities. Thus, inductive KGC, which aims to deduce missing links among unseen entities, has become a new trend. Many existing studies transform inductive KGC as a graph classification problem by extracting enclosing subgraphs surrounding each candidate triple. Unfortunately, they still face certain challenges, such as the expensive time consumption caused by the repeat extraction of enclosing subgraphs, and the deficiency of entity-independent feature learning. To address these issues, we propose a global-local anchor representation (GLAR) learning method for inductive KGC. Unlike previous methods that utilize enclosing subgraphs, we extract a shared opening subgraph for all candidates and perform reasoning on it, enabling the model to perform reasoning more efficiently. Moreover, we design some transferable global and local anchors to learn rich entity-independent features for emerging entities. Finally, a global-local graph reasoning model is applied on the opening subgraph to rank all candidates. Extensive experiments show that our GLAR outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15807v1,2024-04
BASS: Batched Attention-optimized Speculative Sampling,"Haifeng Qian, Sujan Kumar Gonugondla, Sungsoo Ha, Mingyue Shang, Sanjay Krishna Gouda, Ramesh Nallapati, Sudipta Sengupta, Xiaofei Ma, Anoop Deoras","Speculative decoding has emerged as a powerful method to improve latency and throughput in hosting large language models. However, most existing implementations focus on generating a single sequence. Real-world generative AI applications often require multiple responses and how to perform speculative decoding in a batched setting while preserving its latency benefits poses non-trivial challenges. This paper describes a system of batched speculative decoding that sets a new state of the art in multi-sequence generation latency and that demonstrates superior GPU utilization as well as quality of generations within a time budget. For example, for a 7.8B-size model on a single A100 GPU and with a batch size of 8, each sequence is generated at an average speed of 5.8ms per token, the overall throughput being 1.1K tokens per second. These results represent state-of-the-art latency and a 2.15X speed-up over optimized regular decoding. Within a time budget that regular decoding does not finish, our system is able to generate sequences with HumanEval Pass@First of 43% and Pass@All of 61%, far exceeding what's feasible with single-sequence speculative decoding. Our peak GPU utilization during decoding reaches as high as 15.8%, more than 3X the highest of that of regular decoding and around 10X of single-sequence speculative decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15778v2,2024-04
A Comprehensive Survey on Evaluating Large Language Model Applications in the Medical Industry,"Yining Huang, Keke Tang, Meilian Chen, Boyuan Wang","Since the inception of the Transformer architecture in 2017, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and BERT have evolved significantly, impacting various industries with their advanced capabilities in language understanding and generation. These models have shown potential to transform the medical field, highlighting the necessity for specialized evaluation frameworks to ensure their effective and ethical deployment.

ChEX: Interactive Localization and Region Description in Chest X-rays,"Philip Müller, Georgios Kaissis, Daniel Rueckert","Report generation models offer fine-grained textual interpretations of medical images like chest X-rays, yet they often lack interactivity (i.e. the ability to steer the generation process through user queries) and localized interpretability (i.e. visually grounding their predictions), which we deem essential for future adoption in clinical practice. While there have been efforts to tackle these issues, they are either limited in their interactivity by not supporting textual queries or fail to also offer localized interpretability. Therefore, we propose a novel multitask architecture and training paradigm integrating textual prompts and bounding boxes for diverse aspects like anatomical regions and pathologies. We call this approach the Chest X-Ray Explainer (ChEX). Evaluations across a heterogeneous set of 9 chest X-ray tasks, including localized image interpretation and report generation, showcase its competitiveness with SOTA models while additional analysis demonstrates ChEX's interactive capabilities.

Let's Think Dot by Dot: Hidden Computation in Transformer Language Models,"Jacob Pfau, William Merrill, Samuel R. Bowman","Chain-of-thought responses from language models improve performance across most benchmarks. However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance gains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater computation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use meaningless filler tokens (e.g., '......') in place of a chain of thought to solve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without intermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler tokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We also provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where filler tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order formula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens need not provide information about the intermediate computational steps involved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that additional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token choice. The fact that intermediate tokens can act as filler tokens raises concerns about large language models engaging in unauditable, hidden computations that are increasingly detached from the observed chain-of-thought tokens.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15758v1,2024-04
No Train but Gain: Language Arithmetic for training-free Language Adapters enhancement,"Mateusz Klimaszewski, Piotr Andruszkiewicz, Alexandra Birch","Modular deep learning is the state-of-the-art solution for lifting the curse of multilinguality, preventing the impact of negative interference and enabling cross-lingual performance in Multilingual Pre-trained Language Models. However, a trade-off of this approach is the reduction in positive transfer learning from closely related languages. In response, we introduce a novel method called language arithmetic, which enables training-free post-processing to address this limitation. Extending the task arithmetic framework, we apply learning via addition to the language adapters, transitioning the framework from a multi-task to a multilingual setup. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated on three downstream tasks in a MAD-X-based set of cross-lingual schemes, acting as a post-processing procedure. Language arithmetic consistently improves the baselines with significant gains, especially in the most challenging case of zero-shot application.

Annotator-Centric Active Learning for Subjective NLP Tasks,"Michiel van der Meer, Neele Falk, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah, Enrico Liscio","Active Learning (AL) addresses the high costs of collecting human annotations by strategically annotating the most informative samples. However, for subjective NLP tasks, incorporating a wide range of perspectives in the annotation process is crucial to capture the variability in human judgments. We introduce Annotator-Centric Active Learning (ACAL), which incorporates an annotator selection strategy following data sampling. Our objective is two-fold: 1) to efficiently approximate the full diversity of human judgments, and 2) to assess model performance using annotator-centric metrics, which value minority and majority perspectives equally. We experiment with multiple annotator selection strategies across seven subjective NLP tasks, employing both traditional and novel, human-centered evaluation metrics. Our findings indicate that ACAL improves data efficiency and excels in annotator-centric performance evaluations. However, its success depends on the availability of a sufficiently large and diverse pool of annotators to sample from.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15720v4,2024-04

Recently, computational models such as RNN and Transformers have been proposed to automate this process. We take three different approaches to improve upon previous methods, including data augmentation to recover missing reflexes, adding a VAE structure to the Transformer model for proto-to-language prediction, and using a neural machine translation model for the reconstruction task.

The Promise and Challenges of Using LLMs to Accelerate the Screening Process of Systematic Reviews,"Aleksi Huotala, Miikka Kuutila, Paul Ralph, Mika Mäntylä","Systematic review (SR) is a popular research method in software engineering (SE). However, conducting an SR takes an average of 67 weeks. Thus, automating any step of the SR process could reduce the effort associated with SRs. Our objective is to investigate if Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate title-abstract screening by simplifying abstracts for human screeners, and automating title-abstract screening. We performed an experiment where humans screened titles and abstracts for 20 papers with both original and simplified abstracts from a prior SR. The experiment with human screeners was reproduced with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 LLMs to perform the same screening tasks. We also studied if different prompting techniques (Zero-shot (ZS), One-shot (OS), Few-shot (FS), and Few-shot with Chain-of-Thought (FS-CoT)) improve the screening performance of LLMs. Lastly, we studied if redesigning the prompt used in the LLM reproduction of screening leads to improved performance. Text simplification did not increase the screeners' screening performance, but reduced the time used in screening. Screeners' scientific literacy skills and researcher status predict screening performance. Some LLM and prompt combinations perform as well as human screeners in the screening tasks. Our results indicate that the GPT-4 LLM is better than its predecessor, GPT-3.5. Additionally, Few-shot and One-shot prompting outperforms Zero-shot prompting. Using LLMs for text simplification in the screening process does not significantly improve human performance. Using LLMs to automate title-abstract screening seems promising, but current LLMs are not significantly more accurate than human screeners. To recommend the use of LLMs in the screening process of SRs, more research is needed. We recommend future SR studies publish replication packages with screening data to enable more conclusive experimenting with LLM screening.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15667v4,2024-04
KS-LLM: Knowledge Selection of Large Language Models with Evidence Document for Question Answering,"Xinxin Zheng, Feihu Che, Jinyang Wu, Shuai Zhang, Shuai Nie, Kang Liu, Jianhua Tao","Large language models (LLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem and face significant challenges when applied to knowledge-intensive tasks. A promising approach is to leverage evidence documents as extra supporting knowledge, which can be obtained through retrieval or generation. However, existing methods directly leverage the entire contents of the evidence document, which may introduce noise information and impair the performance of large language models. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Knowledge Selection of Large Language Models (KS-LLM) method, aiming to identify valuable information from evidence documents. The KS-LLM approach utilizes triples to effectively select knowledge snippets from evidence documents that are beneficial to answering questions. Specifically, we first generate triples based on the input question, then select the evidence sentences most similar to triples from the evidence document, and finally combine the evidence sentences and triples to assist large language models in generating answers. Experimental comparisons on several question answering datasets, such as TriviaQA, WebQ, and NQ, demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the baselines and achieves the best results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15660v1,2024-04

However, pairwise similarity computation in contrastive loss between image and text pairs poses computational challenges. This paper presents a novel weakly supervised pre-training of vision models on web-scale image-text data. The proposed method reframes pre-training on image-text data as a classification task. Consequently, it eliminates the need for pairwise similarity computations in contrastive loss, achieving a remarkable $2.7\times$ acceleration in training speed compared to contrastive learning on web-scale data. Through extensive experiments spanning diverse vision tasks, including detection and segmentation, we demonstrate that the proposed method maintains high representation quality.

However, it suffers from limited interpretability, high cost, and environmental harm. To address these, we propose to use soft EM with entity-driven answer set expansion. Our approach expands the gold answer set to include diverse surface forms, based on the observation that the surface forms often follow particular patterns depending on the entity type.

Semantic Evolvement Enhanced Graph Autoencoder for Rumor Detection,"Xiang Tao, Liang Wang, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang","Due to the rapid spread of rumors on social media, rumor detection has become an extremely important challenge. Recently, numerous rumor detection models which utilize textual information and the propagation structure of events have been proposed. However, these methods overlook the importance of semantic evolvement information of event in propagation process, which is often challenging to be truly learned in supervised training paradigms and traditional rumor detection methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic evolvement enhanced Graph Autoencoder for Rumor Detection (GARD) model in this paper. The model learns semantic evolvement information of events by capturing local semantic changes and global semantic evolvement information through specific graph autoencoder and reconstruction strategies. By combining semantic evolvement information and propagation structure information, the model achieves a comprehensive understanding of event propagation and perform accurate and robust detection, while also detecting rumors earlier by capturing semantic evolvement information in the early stages. Moreover, in order to enhance the model's ability to learn the distinct patterns of rumors and non-rumors, we introduce a uniformity regularizer to further improve the model's performance. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets confirm the superiority of our GARD method over the state-of-the-art approaches in both overall performance and early rumor detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16076v1,2024-04
CodeIP: A Grammar-Guided Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models of Code,"Batu Guan, Yao Wan, Zhangqian Bi, Zheng Wang, Hongyu Zhang, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation. It now becomes crucial to identify whether the code is AI-generated and to determine the specific model used, particularly for purposes such as protecting Intellectual Property (IP) in industry and preventing cheating in programming exercises. To this end, several attempts have been made to insert watermarks into machine-generated code. However, existing approaches are limited to inserting only a single bit of information. In this paper, we introduce CodeIP, a novel multi-bit watermarking technique that inserts additional information to preserve crucial provenance details, such as the vendor ID of an LLM, thereby safeguarding the IPs of LLMs in code generation. Furthermore, to ensure the syntactical correctness of the generated code, we propose constraining the sampling process for predicting the next token by training a type predictor. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset across five programming languages demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeIP in watermarking LLMs for code generation while maintaining the syntactical correctness of code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15639v3,2024-04

Minimal Evidence Group Identification for Claim Verification,"Xiangci Li, Sihao Chen, Rajvi Kapadia, Jessica Ouyang, Fan Zhang","Claim verification in real-world settings (e.g. against a large collection of candidate evidences retrieved from the web) typically requires identifying and aggregating a complete set of evidence pieces that collectively provide full support to the claim. The problem becomes particularly challenging when there exists distinct sets of evidence that could be used to verify the claim from different perspectives. In this paper, we formally define and study the problem of identifying such minimal evidence groups (MEGs) for claim verification. We show that MEG identification can be reduced from Set Cover problem, based on entailment inference of whether a given evidence group provides full/partial support to a claim. Our proposed approach achieves 18.4% and 34.8% absolute improvements on the WiCE and SciFact datasets over LLM prompting.

Gated Low-rank Adaptation for personalized Code-Switching Automatic Speech Recognition on the low-spec devices,"Gwantae Kim, Bokyeung Lee, Donghyeon Kim, Hanseok Ko","In recent times, there has been a growing interest in utilizing personalized large models on low-spec devices, such as mobile and CPU-only devices. However, utilizing a personalized large model in the on-device is inefficient, and sometimes limited due to computational cost. To tackle the problem, this paper presents the weights separation method to minimize on-device model weights using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Moreover, some people speak multiple languages in an utterance, as known as code-switching, the personalized ASR model is necessary to address such cases. However, current multilingual speech recognition models are limited to recognizing a single language within each utterance. To tackle this problem, we propose code-switching speech recognition models that incorporate fine-tuned monolingual and multilingual speech recognition models. Additionally, we introduce a gated low-rank adaptation(GLoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning with minimal performance degradation. Our experiments, conducted on Korean-English code-switching datasets, demonstrate that fine-tuning speech recognition models for code-switching surpasses the performance of traditional code-switching speech recognition models trained from scratch. Furthermore, GLoRA enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning performance compared to conventional LoRA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02562v1,2024-04
Can Foundational Large Language Models Assist with Conducting Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Investigations?,"Hossein Salami, Brandye Smith-Goettler, Vijay Yadav","General purpose Large Language Models (LLM) such as the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) have attracted much attention in recent years. There is strong evidence that these models can perform remarkably well in various natural language processing tasks. However, how to leverage them to approach domain-specific use cases and drive value remains an open question. In this work, we focus on a specific use case, pharmaceutical manufacturing investigations, and propose that leveraging historical records of manufacturing incidents and deviations in an organization can be beneficial for addressing and closing new cases, or de-risking new manufacturing campaigns. Using a small but diverse dataset of real manufacturing deviations selected from different product lines, we evaluate and quantify the power of three general purpose LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2) in performing tasks related to the above goal. In particular, (1) the ability of LLMs in automating the process of extracting specific information such as root cause of a case from unstructured data, as well as (2) the possibility of identifying similar or related deviations by performing semantic search on the database of historical records are examined. While our results point to the high accuracy of GPT-4 and Claude-2 in the information extraction task, we discuss cases of complex interplay between the apparent reasoning and hallucination behavior of LLMs as a risk factor. Furthermore, we show that semantic search on vector embedding of deviation descriptions can be used to identify similar records, such as those with a similar type of defect, with a high level of accuracy. We discuss further improvements to enhance the accuracy of similar record identification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15578v1,2024-04
Retrieval Head Mechanistically Explains Long-Context Factuality,"Wenhao Wu, Yizhong Wang, Guangxuan Xiao, Hao Peng, Yao Fu","Despite the recent progress in long-context language models, it remains elusive how transformer-based models exhibit the capability to retrieve relevant information from arbitrary locations within the long context. This paper aims to address this question. Our systematic investigation across a wide spectrum of models reveals that a special type of attention heads are largely responsible for retrieving information, which we dub retrieval heads. We identify intriguing properties of retrieval heads:(1) universal: all the explored models with long-context capability have a set of retrieval heads; (2) sparse: only a small portion (less than 5\%) of the attention heads are retrieval. (3) intrinsic: retrieval heads already exist in models pretrained with short context. When extending the context length by continual pretraining, it is still the same set of heads that perform information retrieval. (4) dynamically activated: take Llama-2 7B for example, 12 retrieval heads always attend to the required information no matter how the context is changed. The rest of the retrieval heads are activated in different contexts. (5) causal: completely pruning retrieval heads leads to failure in retrieving relevant information and results in hallucination, while pruning random non-retrieval heads does not affect the model's retrieval ability. We further show that retrieval heads strongly influence chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where the model needs to frequently refer back the question and previously-generated context. Conversely, tasks where the model directly generates the answer using its intrinsic knowledge are less impacted by masking out retrieval heads. These observations collectively explain which internal part of the model seeks information from the input tokens. We believe our insights will foster future research on reducing hallucination, improving reasoning, and compressing the KV cache.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15574v1,2024-04
CASPR: Automated Evaluation Metric for Contrastive Summarization,"Nirupan Ananthamurugan, Dat Duong, Philip George, Ankita Gupta, Sandeep Tata, Beliz Gunel","Summarizing comparative opinions about entities (e.g., hotels, phones) from a set of source reviews, often referred to as contrastive summarization, can considerably aid users in decision making. However, reliably measuring the contrastiveness of the output summaries without relying on human evaluations remains an open problem. Prior work has proposed token-overlap based metrics, Distinctiveness Score, to measure contrast which does not take into account the sensitivity to meaning-preserving lexical variations. In this work, we propose an automated evaluation metric CASPR to better measure contrast between a pair of summaries. Our metric is based on a simple and light-weight method that leverages natural language inference (NLI) task to measure contrast by segmenting reviews into single-claim sentences and carefully aggregating NLI scores between them to come up with a summary-level score.

Our results on a prior dataset CoCoTRIP demonstrate that CASPR can more reliably capture the contrastiveness of the summary pairs compared to the baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15565v2,2024-04
PRISM: Patient Records Interpretation for Semantic Clinical Trial Matching using Large Language Models,"Shashi Kant Gupta, Aditya Basu, Mauro Nievas, Jerrin Thomas, Nathan Wolfrath, Adhitya Ramamurthi, Bradley Taylor, Anai N. Kothari, Regina Schwind, Therica M. Miller, Sorena Nadaf-Rahrov, Yanshan Wang, Hrituraj Singh","Clinical trial matching is the task of identifying trials for which patients may be potentially eligible. Typically, this task is labor-intensive and requires detailed verification of patient electronic health records (EHRs) against the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria of clinical trials. This process is manual, time-intensive, and challenging to scale up, resulting in many patients missing out on potential therapeutic options. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have made automating patient-trial matching possible, as shown in multiple concurrent research studies. However, the current approaches are confined to constrained, often synthetic datasets that do not adequately mirror the complexities encountered in real-world medical data. In this study, we present the first, end-to-end large-scale empirical evaluation of clinical trial matching using real-world EHRs. Our study showcases the capability of LLMs to accurately match patients with appropriate clinical trials. We perform experiments with proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, as well as our custom fine-tuned model called OncoLLM and show that OncoLLM, despite its significantly smaller size, not only outperforms GPT-3.5 but also matches the performance of qualified medical doctors. All experiments were carried out on real-world EHRs that include clinical notes and available clinical trials from a single cancer center in the United States.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15549v2,2024-04
DreamCraft: Text-Guided Generation of Functional 3D Environments in Minecraft,"Sam Earle, Filippos Kokkinos, Yuhe Nie, Julian Togelius, Roberta Raileanu","Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithms enable the automatic generation of complex and diverse artifacts. However, they don't provide high-level control over the generated content and typically require domain expertise. In contrast, text-to-3D methods allow users to specify desired characteristics in natural language, offering a high amount of flexibility and expressivity. But unlike PCG, such approaches cannot guarantee functionality, which is crucial for certain applications like game design. In this paper, we present a method for generating functional 3D artifacts from free-form text prompts in the open-world game Minecraft. Our method, DreamCraft, trains quantized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to represent artifacts that, when viewed in-game, match given text descriptions. We find that DreamCraft produces more aligned in-game artifacts than a baseline that post-processes the output of an unconstrained NeRF. Thanks to the quantized representation of the environment, functional constraints can be integrated using specialized loss terms. We show how this can be leveraged to generate 3D structures that match a target distribution or obey certain adjacency rules over the block types. DreamCraft inherits a high degree of expressivity and controllability from the NeRF, while still being able to incorporate functional constraints through domain-specific objectives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15538v1,2024-04
BattleAgent: Multi-modal Dynamic Emulation on Historical Battles to Complement Historical Analysis,"Shuhang Lin, Wenyue Hua, Lingyao Li, Che-Jui Chang, Lizhou Fan, Jianchao Ji, Hang Hua, Mingyu Jin, Jiebo Luo, Yongfeng Zhang","This paper presents BattleAgent, an emulation system that combines the Large Vision-Language Model and Multi-agent System. This novel system aims to simulate complex dynamic interactions among multiple agents, as well as between agents and their environments, over a period of time. It emulates both the decision-making processes of leaders and the viewpoints of ordinary participants, such as soldiers. The emulation showcases the current capabilities of agents, featuring fine-grained multi-modal interactions between agents and landscapes. It develops customizable agent structures to meet specific situational requirements, for example, a variety of battle-related activities like scouting and trench digging. These components collaborate to recreate historical events in a lively and comprehensive manner while offering insights into the thoughts and feelings of individuals from diverse viewpoints. The technological foundations of BattleAgent establish detailed and immersive settings for historical battles, enabling individual agents to partake in, observe, and dynamically respond to evolving battle scenarios. This methodology holds the potential to substantially deepen our understanding of historical events, particularly through individual accounts. Such initiatives can also aid historical research, as conventional historical narratives often lack documentation and prioritize the perspectives of decision-makers, thereby overlooking the experiences of ordinary individuals. BattelAgent illustrates AI's potential to revitalize the human aspect in crucial social events, thereby fostering a more nuanced collective understanding and driving the progressive development of human society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15532v1,2024-04
LogicBench: Towards Systematic Evaluation of Logical Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models,"Mihir Parmar, Nisarg Patel, Neeraj Varshney, Mutsumi Nakamura, Man Luo, Santosh Mashetty, Arindam Mitra, Chitta Baral","Recently developed large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of language understanding tasks. But, can they really ""reason"" over the natural language? This question has been receiving significant research attention and many reasoning skills such as commonsense, numerical, and qualitative have been studied. However, the crucial skill pertaining to 'logical reasoning' has remained underexplored. Existing work investigating this reasoning ability of LLMs has focused only on a couple of inference rules (such as modus ponens and modus tollens) of propositional and first-order logic. Addressing the above limitation, we comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of LLMs on 25 different reasoning patterns spanning over propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic logics. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce LogicBench, a natural language question-answering dataset focusing on the use of a single inference rule. We conduct detailed analysis with a range of LLMs such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2, and Mistral using chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results show that existing LLMs do not fare well on LogicBench; especially, they struggle with instances involving complex reasoning and negations. Furthermore, they sometimes overlook contextual information necessary for reasoning to arrive at the correct conclusion. We believe that our work and findings facilitate future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning ability of LLMs. Data and code are available at https://github.com/Mihir3009/LogicBench.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15522v2,2024-04
ToM-LM: Delegating Theory of Mind Reasoning to External Symbolic Executors in Large Language Models,"Weizhi Tang, Vaishak Belle","Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability of individuals to attribute mental states to others. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown some promise with ToM ability, they still struggle with complex ToM reasoning. Our approach leverages an external symbolic executor, specifically the SMCDEL model checker, and fine-tuning to improve the ToM reasoning ability of LLMs. In our approach, an LLM is first fine-tuned through pairs of natural language and symbolic formulation representation of ToM problems and is then instructed to generate the symbolic formulation with a one-shot in-context example. The generated symbolic formulation is then executed by the SMCDEL model checker to perform transparent and verifiable ToM reasoning and give the final result. We demonstrate that our approach, ToM-LM, shows a significant improvement over all the constructed baselines. Our study proposes a novel view about externalizing a particular component of ToM reasoning, mainly reasoning about beliefs, and suggests generalizing it to other aspects of ToM reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15515v3,2024-04
Evaluating Tool-Augmented Agents in Remote Sensing Platforms,"Simranjit Singh, Michael Fore, Dimitrios Stamoulis","Tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in remote sensing (RS) applications. However, existing benchmarks assume question-answering input templates over predefined image-text data pairs. These standalone instructions neglect the intricacies of realistic user-grounded tasks. Consider a geospatial analyst: they zoom in a map area, they draw a region over which to collect satellite imagery, and they succinctly ask ""Detect all objects here"". Where is `here`, if it is not explicitly hardcoded in the image-text template, but instead is implied by the system state, e.g., the live map positioning? To bridge this gap, we present GeoLLM-QA, a benchmark designed to capture long sequences of verbal, visual, and click-based actions on a real UI platform. Through in-depth evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs over a diverse set of 1,000 tasks, we offer insights towards stronger agents for RS applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00709v1,2024-04
Killkan: The Automatic Speech Recognition Dataset for Kichwa with Morphosyntactic Information,"Chihiro Taguchi, Jefferson Saransig, Dayana Velásquez, David Chiang","This paper presents Killkan, the first dataset for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the Kichwa language, an indigenous language of Ecuador. Kichwa is an extremely low-resource endangered language, and there have been no resources before Killkan for Kichwa to be incorporated in applications of natural language processing. The dataset contains approximately 4 hours of audio with transcription, translation into Spanish, and morphosyntactic annotation in the format of Universal Dependencies. The audio data was retrieved from a publicly available radio program in Kichwa. This paper also provides corpus-linguistic analyses of the dataset with a special focus on the agglutinative morphology of Kichwa and frequent code-switching with Spanish. The experiments show that the dataset makes it possible to develop the first ASR system for Kichwa with reliable quality despite its small dataset size. This dataset, the ASR model, and the code used to develop them will be publicly available.

IryoNLP at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Tackling the Medical Error Detection & Correction Task On the Shoulders of Medical Agents,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,"In natural language processing applied to the clinical domain, utilizing large language models has emerged as a promising avenue for error detection and correction on clinical notes, a knowledge-intensive task for which annotated data is scarce. This paper presents MedReAct'N'MedReFlex, which leverages a suite of four LLM-based medical agents. The MedReAct agent initiates the process by observing, analyzing, and taking action, generating trajectories to guide the search to target a potential error in the clinical notes. Subsequently, the MedEval agent employs five evaluators to assess the targeted error and the proposed correction. In cases where MedReAct's actions prove insufficient, the MedReFlex agent intervenes, engaging in reflective analysis and proposing alternative strategies. Finally, the MedFinalParser agent formats the final output, preserving the original style while ensuring the integrity of the error correction process. One core component of our method is our RAG pipeline based on our ClinicalCorp corpora. Among other well-known sources containing clinical guidelines and information, we preprocess and release the open-source MedWiki dataset for clinical RAG application. Our results demonstrate the central role of our RAG approach with ClinicalCorp leveraged through the MedReAct'N'MedReFlex framework.

Interactive Analysis of LLMs using Meaningful Counterfactuals,"Furui Cheng, Vilém Zouhar, Robin Shing Moon Chan, Daniel Fürst, Hendrik Strobelt, Mennatallah El-Assady","Counterfactual examples are useful for exploring the decision boundaries of machine learning models and determining feature attributions. How can we apply counterfactual-based methods to analyze and explain LLMs? We identify the following key challenges. First, the generated textual counterfactuals should be meaningful and readable to users and thus can be mentally compared to draw conclusions. Second, to make the solution scalable to long-form text, users should be equipped with tools to create batches of counterfactuals from perturbations at various granularity levels and interactively analyze the results. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges and contribute 1) a novel algorithm for generating batches of complete and meaningful textual counterfactuals by removing and replacing text segments in different granularities, and 2) LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization tool to help users understand an LLM's behaviors by interactively inspecting and aggregating meaningful counterfactuals. We evaluate the proposed algorithm by the grammatical correctness of its generated counterfactuals using 1,000 samples from medical, legal, finance, education, and news datasets. In our experiments, 97.2% of the counterfactuals are grammatically correct. Through a use case, user studies, and feedback from experts, we demonstrate the usefulness and usability of the proposed interactive visualization tool.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00708v1,2024-04
Evaluating the Efficacy of Large Language Models in Identifying Phishing Attempts,"Het Patel, Umair Rehman, Farkhund Iqbal","Phishing, a prevalent cybercrime tactic for decades, remains a significant threat in today's digital world. By leveraging clever social engineering elements and modern technology, cybercrime targets many individuals, businesses, and organizations to exploit trust and security. These cyber-attackers are often disguised in many trustworthy forms to appear as legitimate sources. By cleverly using psychological elements like urgency, fear, social proof, and other manipulative strategies, phishers can lure individuals into revealing sensitive and personalized information. Building on this pervasive issue within modern technology, this paper aims to analyze the effectiveness of 15 Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting phishing attempts, specifically focusing on a randomized set of ""419 Scam"" emails. The objective is to determine which LLMs can accurately detect phishing emails by analyzing a text file containing email metadata based on predefined criteria.

Evaluating LLMs for Hardware Design and Test,"Jason Blocklove, Siddharth Garg, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities for producing code in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs). However, most of the focus remains on their abilities to write functional code, not test code. The hardware design process consists of both design and test, and so eschewing validation and verification leaves considerable potential benefit unexplored, given that a design and test framework may allow for progress towards full automation of the digital design pipeline. In this work, we perform one of the first studies exploring how a LLM can both design and test hardware modules from provided specifications. Using a suite of 8 representative benchmarks, we examined the capabilities and limitations of the state-of-the-art conversational LLMs when producing Verilog for functional and verification purposes.

Evaluating Large Language Models for Material Selection,"Daniele Grandi, Yash Patawari Jain, Allin Groom, Brandon Cramer, Christopher McComb","Material selection is a crucial step in conceptual design due to its significant impact on the functionality, aesthetics, manufacturability, and sustainability impact of the final product. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for material selection in the product design process and compares the performance of LLMs against expert choices for various design scenarios. By collecting a dataset of expert material preferences, the study provides a basis for evaluating how well LLMs can align with expert recommendations through prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning. The divergence between LLM and expert recommendations is measured across different model configurations, prompt strategies, and temperature settings. This approach allows for a detailed analysis of factors influencing the LLMs' effectiveness in recommending materials. The results from this study highlight two failure modes, and identify parallel prompting as a useful prompt-engineering method when using LLMs for material selection. The findings further suggest that, while LLMs can provide valuable assistance, their recommendations often vary significantly from those of human experts. This discrepancy underscores the need for further research into how LLMs can be better tailored to replicate expert decision-making in material selection. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on how LLMs can be integrated into the design process, offering insights into their current limitations and potential for future improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03695v1,2024-04
XC-Cache: Cross-Attending to Cached Context for Efficient LLM Inference,"João Monteiro, Étienne Marcotte, Pierre-André Noël, Valentina Zantedeschi, David Vázquez, Nicolas Chapados, Christopher Pal, Perouz Taslakian","In-context learning (ICL) approaches typically leverage prompting to condition decoder-only language model generation on reference information. Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context isn't known in advance, caching ICL can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform ICL, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of magnitude.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15420v3,2024-04

Our approach, termed Wiki-LLaVA, aims at integrating an external knowledge source of multimodal documents, which is accessed through a hierarchical retrieval pipeline. Relevant passages, using this approach, are retrieved from the external knowledge source and employed as additional context for the LLM, augmenting the effectiveness and precision of generated dialogues.

CT-GLIP: 3D Grounded Language-Image Pretraining with CT Scans and Radiology Reports for Full-Body Scenarios,"Jingyang Lin, Yingda Xia, Jianpeng Zhang, Ke Yan, Le Lu, Jiebo Luo, Ling Zhang","Medical Vision-Language Pretraining (Med-VLP) establishes a connection between visual content from medical images and the relevant textual descriptions. Existing Med-VLP methods primarily focus on 2D images depicting a single body part, notably chest X-rays. In this paper, we extend the scope of Med-VLP to encompass 3D images, specifically targeting full-body scenarios, by using a multimodal dataset of CT images and reports. Compared with the 2D counterpart, 3D VLP is required to effectively capture essential semantics from significantly sparser representation in 3D imaging. In this paper, we introduce CT-GLIP (Grounded Language-Image Pretraining with CT scans), a novel method that constructs organ-level image-text pairs to enhance multimodal contrastive learning, aligning grounded visual features with precise diagnostic text. Additionally, we developed an abnormality dictionary to augment contrastive learning with diverse contrastive pairs. Our method, trained on a multimodal CT dataset comprising 44,011 organ-level vision-text pairs from 17,702 patients across 104 organs, demonstrates it can identify organs and abnormalities in a zero-shot manner using natural languages. The performance of CT-GLIP is validated on a separate test set of 1,130 patients, focusing on the 16 most frequent abnormalities across 7 organs.

Automatic Layout Planning for Visually-Rich Documents with Instruction-Following Models,"Wanrong Zhu, Jennifer Healey, Ruiyi Zhang, William Yang Wang, Tong Sun","Recent advancements in instruction-following models have made user interactions with models more user-friendly and efficient, broadening their applicability. In graphic design, non-professional users often struggle to create visually appealing layouts due to limited skills and resources. In this work, we introduce a novel multimodal instruction-following framework for layout planning, allowing users to easily arrange visual elements into tailored layouts by specifying canvas size and design purpose, such as for book covers, posters, brochures, or menus. We developed three layout reasoning tasks to train the model in understanding and executing layout instructions. Experiments on two benchmarks show that our method not only simplifies the design process for non-professionals but also surpasses the performance of few-shot GPT-4V models, with mIoU higher by 12% on Crello. This progress highlights the potential of multimodal instruction-following models to automate and simplify the design process, providing an approachable solution for a wide range of design tasks on visually-rich documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15271v1,2024-04
Aligning LLM Agents by Learning Latent Preference from User Edits,"Ge Gao, Alexey Taymanov, Eduardo Salinas, Paul Mineiro, Dipendra Misra","We study interactive learning of LLM-based language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output. In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data. The inferred user preference descriptions are used to define prompts for generating responses in the future. This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex, subtle, and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages the LLM to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, and use a GPT-4 simulated user for evaluation. On both tasks, CIPHER outperforms several baselines by achieving the lowest edit distance cost while only having a small overhead in LLM query cost. Our analysis reports that user preferences learned by CIPHER show significant similarity to the ground truth latent preferences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15269v3,2024-04
XFT: Unlocking the Power of Code Instruction Tuning by Simply Merging Upcycled Mixture-of-Experts,"Yifeng Ding, Jiawei Liu, Yuxiang Wei, Terry Yue Zhuo, Lingming Zhang","We introduce XFT, a simple yet powerful training scheme, by simply merging upcycled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to unleash the performance limit of instruction-tuned code Large Language Models (LLMs). While vanilla sparse upcycling fails to improve instruction tuning, XFT introduces a shared expert mechanism with a novel routing weight normalization strategy into sparse upcycling, which significantly boosts instruction tuning. After fine-tuning the upcycled MoE model, XFT introduces a learnable model merging mechanism to compile the upcycled MoE model back to a dense model, achieving upcycled MoE-level performance with only dense-model compute. By applying XFT to a 1.3B model, we create a new state-of-the-art tiny code LLM (<3B) with 67.1 and 64.6 pass@1 on HumanEval and HumanEval+ respectively. With the same data and model architecture, XFT improves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by 13% on HumanEval+, along with consistent improvements from 2% to 13% on MBPP+, MultiPL-E, and DS-1000, demonstrating its generalizability.

Re-Thinking Inverse Graphics With Large Language Models,"Peter Kulits, Haiwen Feng, Weiyang Liu, Victoria Abrevaya, Michael J. Black","Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Successfully disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment. This complexity limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains. Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models to solve inverse-graphics problems. To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation. We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training. Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the application of image-space supervision. Our analysis enables new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs. We release our code and data at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15228v2,2024-04
Unsupervised End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue with LLMs: The Power of the Noisy Channel,"Brendan King, Jeffrey Flanigan","Training task-oriented dialogue systems typically requires turn-level annotations for interacting with their APIs: e.g. a dialogue state and the system actions taken at each step. These annotations can be costly to produce, error-prone, and require both domain and annotation expertise. With advances in LLMs, we hypothesize that unlabeled data and a schema definition are sufficient for building a working task-oriented dialogue system, completely unsupervised. We consider a novel unsupervised setting of only (1) a well-defined API schema (2) a set of unlabeled dialogues between a user and agent. We propose an innovative approach using expectation-maximization (EM) that infers turn-level annotations as latent variables using a noisy channel model to build an end-to-end dialogue agent. Evaluating our approach on the MultiWOZ benchmark, our method more than doubles the dialogue success rate of a strong GPT-3.5 baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15219v2,2024-04
Does Instruction Tuning Make LLMs More Consistent?,"Constanza Fierro, Jiaang Li, Anders Søgaard","The purpose of instruction tuning is enabling zero-shot performance, but instruction tuning has also been shown to improve chain-of-thought reasoning and value alignment (Si et al., 2023). Here we consider the impact on $\textit{consistency}$, i.e., the sensitivity of language models to small perturbations in the input. We compare 10 instruction-tuned LLaMA models to the original LLaMA-7b model and show that almost across-the-board they become more consistent, both in terms of their representations and their predictions in zero-shot and downstream tasks. We explain these improvements through mechanistic analyses of factual recall.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15206v3,2024-04

Student Data Paradox and Curious Case of Single Student-Tutor Model: Regressive Side Effects of Training LLMs for Personalized Learning,"Shashank Sonkar, Naiming Liu, Richard G. Baraniuk","The pursuit of personalized education has led to the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in developing intelligent tutoring systems. To better understand and adapt to individual student needs, including their misconceptions, LLMs need to be trained on extensive datasets of student-tutor dialogues. Our research uncovers a fundamental challenge in this approach: the ``Student Data Paradox.'' This paradox emerges when LLMs, trained on student data to understand learner behavior, inadvertently compromise their own factual knowledge and reasoning abilities. We investigate this paradox by training state-of-the-art language models on student-tutor dialogue datasets and evaluating their performance across multiple benchmarks. These benchmarks assess various aspects of language model capabilities, including reasoning, truthfulness, and common sense understanding. Our findings reveal significant declines in the models' performance across these diverse benchmarks, indicating a broad impact on their capabilities when trained to model student behavior. Our research makes two primary contributions: (1) empirical demonstration of the Student Data Paradox through quantitative analysis of model performance, and (2) introduction of ``hallucination tokens'' as a mitigation strategy. These tokens, while improving performance, highlight the persistent challenge of balancing accurate student behavior modeling with maintaining the LLM's integrity as an educational tool. This study emphasizes the need for innovative solutions to reconcile the conflicting goals of faithfully understanding diverse student cognition while preserving the model's ability to provide accurate information and guidance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15156v2,2024-04
Bias patterns in the application of LLMs for clinical decision support: A comprehensive study,"Raphael Poulain, Hamed Fayyaz, Rahmatollah Beheshti","Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful candidates to inform clinical decision-making processes. While these models play an increasingly prominent role in shaping the digital landscape, two growing concerns emerge in healthcare applications: 1) to what extent do LLMs exhibit social bias based on patients' protected attributes (like race), and 2) how do design choices (like architecture design and prompting strategies) influence the observed biases? To answer these questions rigorously, we evaluated eight popular LLMs across three question-answering (QA) datasets using clinical vignettes (patient descriptions) standardized for bias evaluations. We employ red-teaming strategies to analyze how demographics affect LLM outputs, comparing both general-purpose and clinically-trained models. Our extensive experiments reveal various disparities (some significant) across protected groups. We also observe several counter-intuitive patterns such as larger models not being necessarily less biased and fined-tuned models on medical data not being necessarily better than the general-purpose models. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the impact of prompt design on bias patterns and shows that specific phrasing can influence bias patterns and reflection-type approaches (like Chain of Thought) can reduce biased outcomes effectively. Consistent with prior studies, we call on additional evaluations, scrutiny, and enhancement of LLMs used in clinical decision support applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15149v1,2024-04
Rethinking LLM Memorization through the Lens of Adversarial Compression,"Avi Schwarzschild, Zhili Feng, Pratyush Maini, Zachary C. Lipton, J. Zico Kolter","Large language models (LLMs) trained on web-scale datasets raise substantial concerns regarding permissible data usage. One major question is whether these models ""memorize"" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information. The answer hinges, to a large degree, on how we define memorization. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs. A given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt (much) shorter than the string itself -- in other words, if these strings can be ""compressed"" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens. The ACR overcomes the limitations of existing notions of memorization by (i) offering an adversarial view of measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. Our definition serves as a practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15146v3,2024-04
GSCo: Towards Generalizable AI in Medicine via Generalist-Specialist Collaboration,"Sunan He, Yuxiang Nie, Hongmei Wang, Shu Yang, Yihui Wang, Zhiyuan Cai, Zhixuan Chen, Yingxue Xu, Luyang Luo, Huiling Xiang, Xi Lin, Mingxiang Wu, Yifan Peng, George Shih, Ziyang Xu, Xian Wu, Qiong Wang, Ronald Cheong Kin Chan, Varut Vardhanabhuti, Winnie Chiu Wing Chu, Yefeng Zheng, Pranav Rajpurkar, Kang Zhang, Hao Chen","Generalist foundation models (GFMs) are renowned for their exceptional capability and flexibility in effectively generalizing across diverse tasks and modalities. In the field of medicine, while GFMs exhibit superior generalizability based on their extensive intrinsic knowledge as well as proficiency in instruction following and in-context learning, specialist models excel in precision due to their domain knowledge. In this work, for the first time, we explore the synergy between the GFM and specialist models, to enable precise medical image analysis on a broader scope. Specifically, we propose a cooperative framework, Generalist-Specialist Collaboration (GSCo), which consists of two stages, namely the construction of GFM and specialists, and collaborative inference on downstream tasks. In the construction stage, we develop MedDr, the largest open-source GFM tailored for medicine, showcasing exceptional instruction-following and in-context learning capabilities. Meanwhile, a series of lightweight specialists are crafted for downstream tasks with low computational cost. In the collaborative inference stage, we introduce two cooperative mechanisms, Mixture-of-Expert Diagnosis and Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis, to harvest the generalist's in-context learning abilities alongside the specialists' domain expertise. For a comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale benchmark featuring 28 datasets and about 250,000 images. Extensive results demonstrate that MedDr consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs on downstream datasets. Furthermore, GSCo exceeds both GFMs and specialists across all out-of-domain disease diagnosis datasets. These findings indicate a significant paradigm shift in the application of GFMs, transitioning from separate models for specific tasks to a collaborative approach between GFMs and specialists, thereby advancing the frontiers of generalizable AI in medicine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15127v2,2024-04
Identifying Fairness Issues in Automatically Generated Testing Content,"Kevin Stowe, Benny Longwill, Alyssa Francis, Tatsuya Aoyama, Debanjan Ghosh, Swapna Somasundaran","Natural language generation tools are powerful and effective for generating content. However, language models are known to display bias and fairness issues, making them impractical to deploy for many use cases. We here focus on how fairness issues impact automatically generated test content, which can have stringent requirements to ensure the test measures only what it was intended to measure. Specifically, we review test content generated for a large-scale standardized English proficiency test with the goal of identifying content that only pertains to a certain subset of the test population as well as content that has the potential to be upsetting or distracting to some test takers. Issues like these could inadvertently impact a test taker's score and thus should be avoided. This kind of content does not reflect the more commonly-acknowledged biases, making it challenging even for modern models that contain safeguards. We build a dataset of 601 generated texts annotated for fairness and explore a variety of methods for classification: fine-tuning, topic-based classification, and prompting, including few-shot and self-correcting prompts. We find that combining prompt self-correction and few-shot learning performs best, yielding an F1 score of 0.79 on our held-out test set, while much smaller BERT- and topic-based models have competitive performance on out-of-domain data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15104v2,2024-04
Multi-view Content-aware Indexing for Long Document Retrieval,"Kuicai Dong, Derrick Goh Xin Deik, Yi Quan Lee, Hao Zhang, Xiangyang Li, Cong Zhang, Yong Liu","Long document question answering (DocQA) aims to answer questions from long documents over 10k words. They usually contain content structures such as sections, sub-sections, and paragraph demarcations. However, the indexing methods of long documents remain under-explored, while existing systems generally employ fixed-length chunking. As they do not consider content structures, the resultant chunks can exclude vital information or include irrelevant content. Motivated by this, we propose the Multi-view Content-aware indexing (MC-indexing) for more effective long DocQA via (i) segment structured document into content chunks, and (ii) represent each content chunk in raw-text, keywords, and summary views. We highlight that MC-indexing requires neither training nor fine-tuning. Having plug-and-play capability, it can be seamlessly integrated with any retrievers to boost their performance. Besides, we propose a long DocQA dataset that includes not only question-answer pair, but also document structure and answer scope. When compared to state-of-art chunking schemes, MC-indexing has significantly increased the recall by 42.8%, 30.0%, 23.9%, and 16.3% via top k= 1.5, 3, 5, and 10 respectively. These improved scores are the average of 8 widely used retrievers (2 sparse and 6 dense) via extensive experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15103v1,2024-04
From Complexity to Clarity: How AI Enhances Perceptions of Scientists and the Public's Understanding of Science,David M. Markowitz,"This paper evaluated the effectiveness of using generative AI to simplify science communication and enhance the public's understanding of science. By comparing lay summaries of journal articles from PNAS, yoked to those generated by AI, this work first assessed linguistic simplicity differences across such summaries and public perceptions in follow-up experiments. Specifically, Study 1a analyzed simplicity features of PNAS abstracts (scientific summaries) and significance statements (lay summaries), observing that lay summaries were indeed linguistically simpler, but effect size differences were small. Study 1b used a large language model, GPT-4, to create significance statements based on paper abstracts and this more than doubled the average effect size without fine-tuning. Study 2 experimentally demonstrated that simply-written GPT summaries facilitated more favorable perceptions of scientists (they were perceived as more credible and trustworthy, but less intelligent) than more complexly-written human PNAS summaries. Crucially, Study 3 experimentally demonstrated that participants comprehended scientific writing better after reading simple GPT summaries compared to complex PNAS summaries. In their own words, participants also summarized scientific papers in a more detailed and concrete manner after reading GPT summaries compared to PNAS summaries of the same article. AI has the potential to engage scientific communities and the public via a simple language heuristic, advocating for its integration into scientific dissemination for a more informed society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00706v3,2024-04
Enhancing Textual Personality Detection toward Social Media: Integrating Long-term and Short-term Perspectives,"Haohao Zhu, Xiaokun Zhang, Junyu Lu, Youlin Wu, Zewen Bai, Changrong Min, Liang Yang, Bo Xu, Dongyu Zhang, Hongfei Lin","Textual personality detection aims to identify personality characteristics by analyzing user-generated content toward social media platforms. Numerous psychological literature highlighted that personality encompasses both long-term stable traits and short-term dynamic states. However, existing studies often concentrate only on either long-term or short-term personality representations, without effectively combining both aspects. This limitation hinders a comprehensive understanding of individuals' personalities, as both stable traits and dynamic states are vital. To bridge this gap, we propose a Dual Enhanced Network(DEN) to jointly model users' long-term and short-term personality for textual personality detection. In DEN, a Long-term Personality Encoding is devised to effectively model long-term stable personality traits. Short-term Personality Encoding is presented to capture short-term dynamic personality states. The Bi-directional Interaction component facilitates the integration of both personality aspects, allowing for a comprehensive representation of the user's personality. Experimental results on two personality detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the DEN model and the benefits of considering both the dynamic and stable nature of personality characteristics for textual personality detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15067v1,2024-04
Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts,"Xun Wu, Shaohan Huang, Wenhui Wang, Furu Wei","Sparse Mixtures of Experts (SMoE) scales model capacity without significant increases in training and inference costs, but exhibits the following two issues: (1) Low expert activation, where only a small subset of experts are activated for optimization. (2) Lacking fine-grained analytical capabilities for multiple semantic concepts within individual tokens. We propose Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts (MH-MoE), which employs a multi-head mechanism to split each token into multiple sub-tokens. These sub-tokens are then assigned to and processed by a diverse set of experts in parallel, and seamlessly reintegrated into the original token form. The multi-head mechanism enables the model to collectively attend to information from various representation spaces within different experts, while significantly enhances expert activation, thus deepens context understanding and alleviate overfitting. Moreover, our MH-MoE is straightforward to implement and decouples from other SMoE optimization methods, making it easy to integrate with other SMoE models for enhanced performance. Extensive experimental results across three tasks: English-focused language modeling, Multi-lingual language modeling and Masked multi-modality modeling tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of MH-MoE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15045v1,2024-04
TAXI: Evaluating Categorical Knowledge Editing for Language Models,"Derek Powell, Walter Gerych, Thomas Hartvigsen","Humans rarely learn one fact in isolation. Instead, learning a new fact induces knowledge of other facts about the world. For example, in learning a korat is a type of cat, you also infer it is a mammal and has claws, ensuring your model of the world is consistent. Knowledge editing aims to inject new facts into language models to improve their factuality, but current benchmarks fail to evaluate consistency, which is critical to ensure efficient, accurate, and generalizable edits. We manually create TAXI, a new benchmark dataset specifically created to evaluate consistency in categorical knowledge edits. TAXI contains 11,120 multiple-choice queries for 976 edits spanning 41 categories (e.g., Dogs), 164 subjects (e.g., Labrador), and 183 properties (e.g., is a mammal). We then use TAXI to evaluate popular editors' categorical consistency, measuring how often editing a subject's category appropriately edits its properties. We find that 1) the editors achieve marginal, yet non-random consistency, 2) their consistency far underperforms human baselines, and 3) consistency is more achievable when editing atypical subjects Our code and data are available at https://github.com/derekpowell/taxi.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15004v2,2024-04

According to our experiments, a significantly smaller Generative model consistently outperforms the Pattern-based classification model based on EstBERT. Additionally, we observe a relatively small overlap in errors made by all three models, indicating that an ensemble of different approaches could lead to improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15003v1,2024-04
Transformers Can Represent $n$-gram Language Models,"Anej Svete, Ryan Cotterell","Existing work has analyzed the representational capacity of the transformer architecture by means of formal models of computation. However, the focus so far has been on analyzing the architecture in terms of language \emph{acceptance}. We contend that this is an ill-suited problem in the study of \emph{language models} (LMs), which are definitionally \emph{probability distributions} over strings. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between transformer LMs and $n$-gram LMs, a simple and historically relevant class of language models. We show that transformer LMs using the hard or sparse attention mechanisms can exactly represent any $n$-gram LM, giving us a concrete lower bound on their probabilistic representational capacity. This provides a first step towards understanding the mechanisms that transformer LMs can use to represent probability distributions over strings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14994v3,2024-04
A Reproducibility Study of PLAID,"Sean MacAvaney, Nicola Tonellotto","The PLAID (Performance-optimized Late Interaction Driver) algorithm for ColBERTv2 uses clustered term representations to retrieve and progressively prune documents for final (exact) document scoring. In this paper, we reproduce and fill in missing gaps from the original work. By studying the parameters PLAID introduces, we find that its Pareto frontier is formed of a careful balance among its three parameters; deviations beyond the suggested settings can substantially increase latency without necessarily improving its effectiveness. We then compare PLAID with an important baseline missing from the paper: re-ranking a lexical system. We find that applying ColBERTv2 as a re-ranker atop an initial pool of BM25 results provides better efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs in low-latency settings. However, re-ranking cannot reach peak effectiveness at higher latency settings due to limitations in recall of lexical matching and provides a poor approximation of an exhaustive ColBERTv2 search. We find that recently proposed modifications to re-ranking that pull in the neighbors of top-scoring documents overcome this limitation, providing a Pareto frontier across all operational points for ColBERTv2 when evaluated using a well-annotated dataset. Curious about why re-ranking methods are highly competitive with PLAID, we analyze the token representation clusters PLAID uses for retrieval and find that most clusters are predominantly aligned with a single token and vice versa. Given the competitive trade-offs that re-ranking baselines exhibit, this work highlights the importance of carefully selecting pertinent baselines when evaluating the efficiency of retrieval engines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14989v1,2024-04
Atomas: Hierarchical Alignment on Molecule-Text for Unified Molecule Understanding and Generation,"Yikun Zhang, Geyan Ye, Chaohao Yuan, Bo Han, Long-Kai Huang, Jianhua Yao, Wei Liu, Yu Rong","Molecule-and-text cross-modal representation learning has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the quality of molecular representation, thereby improving performance in various scientific fields, including drug discovery and materials science. Existing studies adopt a global alignment approach to learn the knowledge from different modalities. These global alignment approaches fail to capture fine-grained information, such as molecular fragments and their corresponding textual description, which is crucial for downstream tasks. Furthermore, it is incapable to model such information using a similar global alignment strategy due to data scarcity of paired local part annotated data from existing datasets. In this paper, we propose Atomas, a multi-modal molecular representation learning framework to jointly learn representations from SMILES string and text. We design a Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model to concurrently learn the fine-grained fragment correspondence between two modalities and align these representations of fragments in three levels. Additionally, Atomas's end-to-end training framework incorporates the tasks of understanding and generating molecule, thereby supporting a wider range of downstream tasks. In the retrieval task, Atomas exhibits robust generalization ability and outperforms the baseline by 30.8% of recall@1 on average. In the generation task, Atomas achieves state-of-the-art results in both molecule captioning task and molecule generation task. Moreover, the visualization of the Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model further confirms the chemical significance of our approach.

Social Media and Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Cities and Societies: A Water Quality Analysis Use-case,"Muhammad Asif Auyb, Muhammad Tayyab Zamir, Imran Khan, Hannia Naseem, Nasir Ahmad, Kashif Ahmad","This paper focuses on a very important societal challenge of water quality analysis. Being one of the key factors in the economic and social development of society, the provision of water and ensuring its quality has always remained one of the top priorities of public authorities. To ensure the quality of water, different methods for monitoring and assessing the water networks, such as offline and online surveys, are used. However, these surveys have several limitations, such as the limited number of participants and low frequency due to the labor involved in conducting such surveys. In this paper, we propose a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automatically collect and analyze water-related posts from social media for data-driven decisions. The proposed framework is composed of two components, namely (i) text classification, and (ii) topic modeling. For text classification, we propose a merit-fusion-based framework incorporating several Large Language Models (LLMs) where different weight selection and optimization methods are employed to assign weights to the LLMs. In topic modeling, we employed the BERTopic library to discover the hidden topic patterns in the water-related tweets. We also analyzed relevant tweets originating from different regions and countries to explore global, regional, and country-specific issues and water-related concerns. We also collected and manually annotated a large-scale dataset, which is expected to facilitate future research on the topic.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14977v1,2024-04
Achieving >97% on GSM8K: Deeply Understanding the Problems Makes LLMs Better Solvers for Math Word Problems,"Qihuang Zhong, Kang Wang, Ziyang Xu, Juhua Liu, Liang Ding, Bo Du","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has enhanced the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various reasoning tasks. However, CoT still falls short in dealing with complex math word problems, as it usually suffers from three pitfalls: semantic misunderstanding errors, calculation errors, and step-missing errors. Prior studies involve addressing the calculation errors and step-missing errors, but neglect the semantic misunderstanding errors, which is the major factor limiting the reasoning performance of LLMs. To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, namely Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP), to improve the LLMs' math problem-solving ability by addressing semantic misunderstanding errors. The core of our method is to encourage the LLMs to deeply understand the problems and extract the key problem-solving information used for better reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 diverse reasoning benchmarks show that our DUP method consistently outperforms the other counterparts by a large margin. More encouragingly, DUP achieves a new SOTA result on the GSM8K benchmark, with an accuracy of 97.1% under the zero-shot setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14963v4,2024-04
StoryTTS: A Highly Expressive Text-to-Speech Dataset with Rich Textual Expressiveness Annotations,"Sen Liu, Yiwei Guo, Xie Chen, Kai Yu","While acoustic expressiveness has long been studied in expressive text-to-speech (ETTS), the inherent expressiveness in text lacks sufficient attention, especially for ETTS of artistic works. In this paper, we introduce StoryTTS, a highly ETTS dataset that contains rich expressiveness both in acoustic and textual perspective, from the recording of a Mandarin storytelling show. A systematic and comprehensive labeling framework is proposed for textual expressiveness. We analyze and define speech-related textual expressiveness in StoryTTS to include five distinct dimensions through linguistics, rhetoric, etc. Then we employ large language models and prompt them with a few manual annotation examples for batch annotation. The resulting corpus contains 61 hours of consecutive and highly prosodic speech equipped with accurate text transcriptions and rich textual expressiveness annotations. Therefore, StoryTTS can aid future ETTS research to fully mine the abundant intrinsic textual and acoustic features. Experiments are conducted to validate that TTS models can generate speech with improved expressiveness when integrating with the annotated textual labels in StoryTTS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14946v1,2024-04
Does It Make Sense to Explain a Black Box With Another Black Box?,"Julien Delaunay, Luis Galárraga, Christine Largouët","Although counterfactual explanations are a popular approach to explain ML black-box classifiers, they are less widespread in NLP. Most methods find those explanations by iteratively perturbing the target document until it is classified differently by the black box. We identify two main families of counterfactual explanation methods in the literature, namely, (a) \emph{transparent} methods that perturb the target by adding, removing, or replacing words, and (b) \emph{opaque} approaches that project the target document into a latent, non-interpretable space where the perturbation is carried out subsequently. This article offers a comparative study of the performance of these two families of methods on three classical NLP tasks. Our empirical evidence shows that opaque approaches can be an overkill for downstream applications such as fake news detection or sentiment analysis since they add an additional level of complexity with no significant performance gain. These observations motivate our discussion, which raises the question of whether it makes sense to explain a black box using another black box.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14943v1,2024-04
Graph Machine Learning in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs),"Wenqi Fan, Shijie Wang, Jiani Huang, Zhikai Chen, Yu Song, Wenzhuo Tang, Haitao Mao, Hui Liu, Xiaorui Liu, Dawei Yin, Qing Li","Graphs play an important role in representing complex relationships in various domains like social networks, knowledge graphs, and molecular discovery. With the advent of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a cornerstone in Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML), facilitating the representation and processing of graph structures. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in language tasks and are widely adopted in a variety of applications such as computer vision and recommender systems. This remarkable success has also attracted interest in applying LLMs to the graph domain. Increasing efforts have been made to explore the potential of LLMs in advancing Graph ML's generalization, transferability, and few-shot learning ability. Meanwhile, graphs, especially knowledge graphs, are rich in reliable factual knowledge, which can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and potentially alleviate their limitations such as hallucinations and the lack of explainability. Given the rapid progress of this research direction, a systematic review summarizing the latest advancements for Graph ML in the era of LLMs is necessary to provide an in-depth understanding to researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this survey, we first review the recent developments in Graph ML. We then explore how LLMs can be utilized to enhance the quality of graph features, alleviate the reliance on labeled data, and address challenges such as graph heterogeneity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Afterward, we delve into how graphs can enhance LLMs, highlighting their abilities to enhance LLM pre-training and inference.

Beyond Code Generation: An Observational Study of ChatGPT Usage in Software Engineering Practice,"Ranim Khojah, Mazen Mohamad, Philipp Leitner, Francisco Gomes de Oliveira Neto","Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently discussed in academia and the general public as support tools for virtually any use case that relies on the production of text, including software engineering. Currently there is much debate, but little empirical evidence, regarding the practical usefulness of LLM-based tools such as ChatGPT for engineers in industry. We conduct an observational study of 24 professional software engineers who have been using ChatGPT over a period of one week in their jobs, and qualitatively analyse their dialogues with the chatbot as well as their overall experience (as captured by an exit survey). We find that, rather than expecting ChatGPT to generate ready-to-use software artifacts (e.g., code), practitioners more often use ChatGPT to receive guidance on how to solve their tasks or learn about a topic in more abstract terms. We also propose a theoretical framework for how (i) purpose of the interaction, (ii) internal factors (e.g., the user's personality), and (iii) external factors (e.g., company policy) together shape the experience (in terms of perceived usefulness and trust). We envision that our framework can be used by future research to further the academic discussion on LLM usage by software engineering practitioners, and to serve as a reference point for the design of future empirical LLM research in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14901v2,2024-04
Beyond the Speculative Game: A Survey of Speculative Execution in Large Language Models,"Chen Zhang, Zhuorui Liu, Dawei Song","With the increasingly giant scales of (causal) large language models (LLMs), the inference efficiency comes as one of the core concerns along the improved performance. In contrast to the memory footprint, the latency bottleneck seems to be of greater importance as there can be billions of requests to a LLM (e.g., GPT-4) per day. The bottleneck is mainly due to the autoregressive innateness of LLMs, where tokens can only be generated sequentially during decoding. To alleviate the bottleneck, the idea of speculative execution, which originates from the field of computer architecture, is introduced to LLM decoding in a \textit{draft-then-verify} style. Under this regime, a sequence of tokens will be drafted in a fast pace by utilizing some heuristics, and then the tokens shall be verified in parallel by the LLM. As the costly sequential inference is parallelized, LLM decoding speed can be significantly boosted. Driven by the success of LLMs in recent couple of years, a growing literature in this direction has emerged. Yet, there lacks a position survey to summarize the current landscape and draw a roadmap for future development of this promising area. To meet this demand, we present the very first survey paper that reviews and unifies literature of speculative execution in LLMs (e.g., blockwise parallel decoding, speculative decoding, etc.) in a comprehensive framework and a systematic taxonomy. Based on the taxonomy, we present a critical review and comparative analysis of the current arts. Finally we highlight various key challenges and future directions to further develop the area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14897v1,2024-04
Language in Vivo vs. in Silico: Size Matters but Larger Language Models Still Do Not Comprehend Language on a Par with Humans,"Vittoria Dentella, Fritz Guenther, Evelina Leivada","Understanding the limits of language is a prerequisite for Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as theories of natural language. LLM performance in some language tasks presents both quantitative and qualitative differences from that of humans, however it remains to be determined whether such differences are amenable to model size. This work investigates the critical role of model scaling, determining whether increases in size make up for such differences between humans and models. We test three LLMs from different families (Bard, 137 billion parameters; ChatGPT-3.5, 175 billion; ChatGPT-4, 1.5 trillion) on a grammaticality judgment task featuring anaphora, center embedding, comparatives, and negative polarity. N=1,200 judgments are collected and scored for accuracy, stability, and improvements in accuracy upon repeated presentation of a prompt. Results of the best performing LLM, ChatGPT-4, are compared to results of n=80 humans on the same stimuli. We find that humans are overall less accurate than ChatGPT-4 (76% vs. 80% accuracy, respectively), but that this is due to ChatGPT-4 outperforming humans only in one task condition, namely on grammatical sentences. Additionally, ChatGPT-4 wavers more than humans in its answers (12.5% vs. 9.6% likelihood of an oscillating answer, respectively). Thus, while increased model size may lead to better performance, LLMs are still not sensitive to (un)grammaticality the same way as humans are. It seems possible but unlikely that scaling alone can fix this issue. We interpret these results by comparing language learning in vivo and in silico, identifying three critical differences concerning (i) the type of evidence, (ii) the poverty of the stimulus, and (iii) the occurrence of semantic hallucinations due to impenetrable linguistic reference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14883v2,2024-04
From Matching to Generation: A Survey on Generative Information Retrieval,"Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Yujia Zhou, Yuyao Zhang, Peitian Zhang, Yutao Zhu, Zhicheng Dou","Information Retrieval (IR) systems are crucial tools for users to access information, widely applied in scenarios like search engines, question answering, and recommendation systems. Traditional IR methods, based on similarity matching to return ranked lists of documents, have been reliable means of information acquisition, dominating the IR field for years. With the advancement of pre-trained language models, generative information retrieval (GenIR) has emerged as a novel paradigm, gaining increasing attention in recent years. Currently, research in GenIR can be categorized into two aspects: generative document retrieval (GR) and reliable response generation. GR leverages the generative model's parameters for memorizing documents, enabling retrieval by directly generating relevant document identifiers without explicit indexing. Reliable response generation, on the other hand, employs language models to directly generate the information users seek, breaking the limitations of traditional IR in terms of document granularity and relevance matching, offering more flexibility, efficiency, and creativity, thus better meeting practical needs. This paper aims to systematically review the latest research progress in GenIR. We will summarize the advancements in GR regarding model training, document identifier, incremental learning, downstream tasks adaptation, multi-modal GR and generative recommendation, as well as progress in reliable response generation in aspects of internal knowledge memorization, external knowledge augmentation, generating response with citations and personal information assistant. We also review the evaluation, challenges and future prospects in GenIR systems.

As a widely applied powerful technique in natural language processing, employing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques could potentially enhance the performance of PLMs. However, the direct transfer to life science tasks is non-trivial due to the different training strategies and data forms. To address this gap, we introduce SES-Adapter, a simple, efficient, and scalable adapter method for enhancing the representation learning of PLMs. SES-Adapter incorporates PLM embeddings with structural sequence embeddings to create structure-aware representations. We show that the proposed method is compatible with different PLM architectures and across diverse tasks. Extensive evaluations are conducted on 2 types of folding structures with notable quality differences, 9 state-of-the-art baselines, and 9 benchmark datasets across distinct downstream tasks. Results show that compared to vanilla PLMs, SES-Adapter improves downstream task performance by a maximum of 11% and an average of 3%, with significantly accelerated training speed by a maximum of 1034% and an average of 362%, the convergence rate is also improved by approximately 2 times. Moreover, positive optimization is observed even with low-quality predicted structures. The source code for SES-Adapter is available at https://github.com/tyang816/SES-Adapter.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14850v1,2024-04
Towards Universal Dense Blocking for Entity Resolution,"Tianshu Wang, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Xiaoyang Chen, Boxi Cao, Le Sun","Blocking is a critical step in entity resolution, and the emergence of neural network-based representation models has led to the development of dense blocking as a promising approach for exploring deep semantics in blocking. However, previous advanced self-supervised dense blocking approaches require domain-specific training on the target domain, which limits the benefits and rapid adaptation of these methods. To address this issue, we propose UniBlocker, a dense blocker that is pre-trained on a domain-independent, easily-obtainable tabular corpus using self-supervised contrastive learning. By conducting domain-independent pre-training, UniBlocker can be adapted to various downstream blocking scenarios without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. To evaluate the universality of our entity blocker, we also construct a new benchmark covering a wide range of blocking tasks from multiple domains and scenarios. Our experiments show that the proposed UniBlocker, without any domain-specific learning, significantly outperforms previous self- and unsupervised dense blocking methods and is comparable and complementary to the state-of-the-art sparse blocking methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14831v2,2024-04
Sentence-Level or Token-Level? A Comprehensive Study on Knowledge Distillation,"Jingxuan Wei, Linzhuang Sun, Yichong Leng, Xu Tan, Bihui Yu, Ruifeng Guo","Knowledge distillation, transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, has emerged as a powerful technique in neural machine translation for compressing models or simplifying training targets. Knowledge distillation encompasses two primary methods: sentence-level distillation and token-level distillation. In sentence-level distillation, the student model is trained to align with the output of the teacher model, which can alleviate the training difficulty and give student model a comprehensive understanding of global structure. Differently, token-level distillation requires the student model to learn the output distribution of the teacher model, facilitating a more fine-grained transfer of knowledge. Studies have revealed divergent performances between sentence-level and token-level distillation across different scenarios, leading to the confusion on the empirical selection of knowledge distillation methods. In this study, we argue that token-level distillation, with its more complex objective (i.e., distribution), is better suited for ``simple'' scenarios, while sentence-level distillation excels in ``complex'' scenarios. To substantiate our hypothesis, we systematically analyze the performance of distillation methods by varying the model size of student models, the complexity of text, and the difficulty of decoding procedure. While our experimental results validate our hypothesis, defining the complexity level of a given scenario remains a challenging task. So we further introduce a novel hybrid method that combines token-level and sentence-level distillation through a gating mechanism, aiming to leverage the advantages of both individual methods. Experiments demonstrate that the hybrid method surpasses the performance of token-level or sentence-level distillation methods and the previous works by a margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14827v1,2024-04
Pattern-Aware Chain-of-Thought Prompting in Large Language Models,"Yufeng Zhang, Xuepeng Wang, Lingxiang Wu, Jinqiao Wang","Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting can guide language models to engage in complex multi-step reasoning. The quality of provided demonstrations significantly impacts the success of downstream inference tasks. While existing automated methods prioritize accuracy and semantics in these demonstrations, we show that the underlying reasoning patterns play a more crucial role in such tasks. In this paper, we propose Pattern-Aware CoT, a prompting method that considers the diversity of demonstration patterns. By incorporating patterns such as step length and reasoning process within intermediate steps, PA-CoT effectively mitigates the issue of bias induced by demonstrations and enables better generalization to diverse scenarios. We conduct experiments on nine reasoning benchmark tasks using two open-source LLMs. The results show that our method substantially enhances reasoning performance and exhibits robustness to errors. The code will be made publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14812v1,2024-04
"A Survey of Large Language Models on Generative Graph Analytics: Query, Learning, and Applications","Wenbo Shang, Xin Huang","A graph is a fundamental data model to represent various entities and their complex relationships in society and nature, such as social networks, transportation networks, financial networks, and biomedical systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have showcased a strong generalization ability to handle various NLP and multi-mode tasks to answer users' arbitrary questions and specific-domain content generation. Compared with graph learning models, LLMs enjoy superior advantages in addressing the challenges of generalizing graph tasks by eliminating the need for training graph learning models and reducing the cost of manual annotation. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of existing LLM studies on graph data, which summarizes the relevant graph analytics tasks solved by advanced LLM models and points out the existing remaining challenges and future directions. Specifically, we study the key problems of LLM-based generative graph analytics (LLM-GGA) with three categories: LLM-based graph query processing (LLM-GQP), LLM-based graph inference and learning (LLM-GIL), and graph-LLM-based applications. LLM-GQP focuses on an integration of graph analytics techniques and LLM prompts, including graph understanding and knowledge graph (KG) based augmented retrieval, while LLM-GIL focuses on learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning and graph representation. We summarize the useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks. Moreover, we give a summary of LLM model evaluation, benchmark datasets/tasks, and a deep pro and cons analysis of LLM models. We also explore open problems and future directions in this exciting interdisciplinary research area of LLMs and graph analytics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14809v1,2024-04
Watch Out for Your Guidance on Generation! Exploring Conditional Backdoor Attacks against Large Language Models,"Jiaming He, Wenbo Jiang, Guanyu Hou, Wenshu Fan, Rui Zhang, Hongwei Li","Mainstream backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically set a fixed trigger in the input instance and specific responses for triggered queries. However, the fixed trigger setting (e.g., unusual words) may be easily detected by human detection, limiting the effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios. To enhance the stealthiness of backdoor activation, we present a new poisoning paradigm against LLMs triggered by specifying generation conditions, which are commonly adopted strategies by users during model inference. The poisoned model performs normally for output under normal/other generation conditions, while becomes harmful for output under target generation conditions. To achieve this objective, we introduce BrieFool, an efficient attack framework. It leverages the characteristics of generation conditions by efficient instruction sampling and poisoning data generation, thereby influencing the behavior of LLMs under target conditions. Our attack can be generally divided into two types with different targets: Safety unalignment attack and Ability degradation attack. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BrieFool is effective across safety domains and ability domains, achieving higher success rates than baseline methods, with 94.3 % on GPT-3.5-turbo",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14795v5,2024-04

Our experiments systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these tuning strategies across various well-known medical benchmarks. Notably, our medical LLM Med42 showed an accuracy level of 72% on the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) datasets, setting a new standard in performance for openly available medical LLMs. Through this comparative analysis, we aim to identify the most effective and efficient method for fine-tuning LLMs in the medical domain, thereby contributing significantly to the advancement of AI-driven healthcare applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14779v1,2024-04

Simulating Task-Oriented Dialogues with State Transition Graphs and Large Language Models,"Chris Samarinas, Pracha Promthaw, Atharva Nijasure, Hansi Zeng, Julian Killingback, Hamed Zamani","This paper explores SynTOD, a new synthetic data generation approach for developing end-to-end Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) Systems capable of handling complex tasks such as intent classification, slot filling, conversational question-answering, and retrieval-augmented response generation, without relying on crowdsourcing or real-world data. SynTOD utilizes a state transition graph to define the desired behavior of a TOD system and generates diverse, structured conversations through random walks and response simulation using large language models (LLMs). In our experiments, using graph-guided response simulations leads to significant improvements in intent classification, slot filling and response relevance compared to naive single-prompt simulated conversations. We also investigate the end-to-end TOD effectiveness of different base and instruction-tuned LLMs, with and without the constructed synthetic conversations. Finally, we explore how various LLMs can evaluate responses in a TOD system and how well they are correlated with human judgments. Our findings pave the path towards quick development and evaluation of domain-specific TOD systems. We release our datasets, models, and code for research purposes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14772v1,2024-04
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Domain-specific Question Answering,"Sanat Sharma, David Seunghyun Yoon, Franck Dernoncourt, Dewang Sultania, Karishma Bagga, Mengjiao Zhang, Trung Bui, Varun Kotte","Question answering (QA) has become an important application in the advanced development of large language models. General pre-trained large language models for question-answering are not trained to properly understand the knowledge or terminology for a specific domain, such as finance, healthcare, education, and customer service for a product. To better cater to domain-specific understanding, we build an in-house question-answering system for Adobe products. We propose a novel framework to compile a large question-answer database and develop the approach for retrieval-aware finetuning of a Large Language model.

Semantic Cells: Evolutional Process to Acquire Sense Diversity of Items,"Yukio Ohsawa, Dingming Xue, Kaira Sekiguchi","Previous models for learning the semantic vectors of items and their groups, such as words, sentences, nodes, and graphs, using distributed representation have been based on the assumption that the basic sense of an item corresponds to one vector composed of dimensions corresponding to hidden contexts in the target real world, from which multiple senses of the item are obtained by conforming to lexical databases or adapting to the context. However, there may be multiple senses of an item, which are hardly assimilated and change or evolve dynamically following the contextual shift even within a document or a restricted period. This is a process similar to the evolution or adaptation of a living entity with/to environmental shifts. Setting the scope of disambiguation of items for sensemaking, the author presents a method in which a word or item in the data embraces multiple semantic vectors that evolve via interaction with others, similar to a cell embracing chromosomes crossing over with each other. We obtained two preliminary results: (1) the role of a word that evolves to acquire the largest or lower-middle variance of semantic vectors tends to be explainable by the author of the text; (2) the epicenters of earthquakes that acquire larger variance via crossover, corresponding to the interaction with diverse areas of land crust, are likely to correspond to the epicenters of forthcoming large earthquakes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14749v2,2024-04
SHED: Shapley-Based Automated Dataset Refinement for Instruction Fine-Tuning,"Yexiao He, Ziyao Wang, Zheyu Shen, Guoheng Sun, Yucong Dai, Yongkai Wu, Hongyi Wang, Ang Li","The pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted for many downstream tasks and tailored to align with human preferences through fine-tuning. Recent studies have discovered that LLMs can achieve desirable performance with only a small amount of high-quality data, suggesting that a large amount of the data in these extensive datasets is redundant or even harmful. Identifying high-quality data from vast datasets to curate small yet effective datasets has emerged as a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce SHED, an automated dataset refinement framework based on Shapley value for instruction fine-tuning. SHED eliminates the need for human intervention or the use of commercial LLMs. Moreover, the datasets curated through SHED exhibit transferability, indicating they can be reused across different LLMs with consistently high performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the datasets curated by SHED. The results demonstrate SHED's superiority over state-of-the-art methods across various tasks and LLMs; notably, datasets comprising only 10% of the original data selected by SHED achieve performance comparable to or surpassing that of the full datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00705v2,2024-04
Modeling the Sacred: Considerations when Using Religious Texts in Natural Language Processing,Ben Hutchinson,"This position paper concerns the use of religious texts in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is of special interest to the Ethics of NLP. Religious texts are expressions of culturally important values, and machine learned models have a propensity to reproduce cultural values encoded in their training data. Furthermore, translations of religious texts are frequently used by NLP researchers when language data is scarce. This repurposes the translations from their original uses and motivations, which often involve attracting new followers. This paper argues that NLP's use of such texts raises considerations that go beyond model biases, including data provenance, cultural contexts, and their use in proselytism. We argue for more consideration of researcher positionality, and of the perspectives of marginalized linguistic and religious communities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14740v2,2024-04
Generate-on-Graph: Treat LLM as both Agent and KG in Incomplete Knowledge Graph Question Answering,"Yao Xu, Shizhu He, Jiabei Chen, Zihao Wang, Yangqiu Song, Hanghang Tong, Guang Liu, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","To address the issues of insufficient knowledge and hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous studies have explored integrating LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, these methods are typically evaluated on conventional Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) with complete KGs, where all factual triples required for each question are entirely covered by the given KG. In such cases, LLMs primarily act as an agent to find answer entities within the KG, rather than effectively integrating the internal knowledge of LLMs and external knowledge sources such as KGs. In fact, KGs are often incomplete to cover all the knowledge required to answer questions. To simulate these real-world scenarios and evaluate the ability of LLMs to integrate internal and external knowledge, we propose leveraging LLMs for QA under Incomplete Knowledge Graph (IKGQA), where the provided KG lacks some of the factual triples for each question, and construct corresponding datasets. To handle IKGQA, we propose a training-free method called Generate-on-Graph (GoG), which can generate new factual triples while exploring KGs. Specifically, GoG performs reasoning through a Thinking-Searching-Generating framework, which treats LLM as both Agent and KG in IKGQA. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our GoG outperforms all previous methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14741v3,2024-04

Insights into Alignment: Evaluating DPO and its Variants Across Multiple Tasks,"Amir Saeidi, Shivanshu Verma, Chitta Baral","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a spectrum of tasks. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an RL-free approach to optimize the policy model on human preferences. However, several limitations hinder the widespread adoption of this method. To address these shortcomings, various versions of DPO have been introduced. Yet, a comprehensive evaluation of these variants across diverse tasks is still lacking. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by investigating the performance of alignment methods across three distinct scenarios: (1) keeping the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) part, (2) skipping the SFT part, and (3) skipping the SFT part and utilizing an instruction-tuned model. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different training sizes on their performance. Our evaluation spans a range of tasks including dialogue systems, reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, question answering, truthfulness, and multi-task understanding, encompassing 13 benchmarks such as MT-Bench, Big Bench, and Open LLM Leaderboard. Key observations reveal that alignment methods achieve optimal performance with smaller training data subsets, exhibit limited effectiveness in reasoning tasks yet significantly impact mathematical problem-solving, and employing an instruction-tuned model notably influences truthfulness. We anticipate that our findings will catalyze further research aimed at developing more robust models to address alignment challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14723v1,2024-04
"Bayesian Example Selection Improves In-Context Learning for Speech, Text, and Visual Modalities","Siyin Wang, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Ji Wu, Chao Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) based on a few examples presented in dialogue history without any model parameter update. Despite such convenience, the performance of ICL heavily depends on the quality of the in-context examples presented, which makes the in-context example selection approach a critical choice. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian in-Context example Selection method (ByCS) for ICL. Extending the inference probability conditioned on in-context examples based on Bayes' theorem, ByCS focuses on the inverse inference conditioned on test input. Following the assumption that accurate inverse inference probability (likelihood) will result in accurate inference probability (posterior), in-context examples are selected based on their inverse inference results. Diverse and extensive cross-tasking and cross-modality experiments are performed with speech, text, and image examples. Experimental results show the efficacy and robustness of our ByCS method on various models, tasks and modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14716v2,2024-04
FINEMATCH: Aspect-based Fine-grained Image and Text Mismatch Detection and Correction,"Hang Hua, Jing Shi, Kushal Kafle, Simon Jenni, Daoan Zhang, John Collomosse, Scott Cohen, Jiebo Luo","Recent progress in large-scale pre-training has led to the development of advanced vision-language models (VLMs) with remarkable proficiency in comprehending and generating multimodal content. Despite the impressive ability to perform complex reasoning for VLMs, current models often struggle to effectively and precisely capture the compositional information on both the image and text sides. To address this, we propose FineMatch, a new aspect-based fine-grained text and image matching benchmark, focusing on text and image mismatch detection and correction. This benchmark introduces a novel task for boosting and evaluating the VLMs' compositionality for aspect-based fine-grained text and image matching. In this task, models are required to identify mismatched aspect phrases within a caption, determine the aspect's class, and propose corrections for an image-text pair that may contain between 0 and 3 mismatches. To evaluate the models' performance on this new task, we propose a new evaluation metric named ITM-IoU for which our experiments show a high correlation to human evaluation. In addition, we also provide a comprehensive experimental analysis of existing mainstream VLMs, including fully supervised learning and in-context learning settings. We have found that models trained on FineMatch demonstrate enhanced proficiency in detecting fine-grained text and image mismatches. Moreover, models (e.g., GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision) with strong abilities to perform multimodal in-context learning are not as skilled at fine-grained compositional image and text matching analysis. With FineMatch, we are able to build a system for text-to-image generation hallucination detection and correction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14715v2,2024-04
FlashSpeech: Efficient Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis,"Zhen Ye, Zeqian Ju, Haohe Liu, Xu Tan, Jianyi Chen, Yiwen Lu, Peiwen Sun, Jiahao Pan, Weizhen Bian, Shulin He, Wei Xue, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo","Recent progress in large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis has been significantly advanced by language models and diffusion models. However, the generation process of both methods is slow and computationally intensive. Efficient speech synthesis using a lower computing budget to achieve quality on par with previous work remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present FlashSpeech, a large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis system with approximately 5\% of the inference time compared with previous work. FlashSpeech is built on the latent consistency model and applies a novel adversarial consistency training approach that can train from scratch without the need for a pre-trained diffusion model as the teacher. Furthermore, a new prosody generator module enhances the diversity of prosody, making the rhythm of the speech sound more natural. The generation processes of FlashSpeech can be achieved efficiently with one or two sampling steps while maintaining high audio quality and high similarity to the audio prompt for zero-shot speech generation. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of FlashSpeech. Notably, FlashSpeech can be about 20 times faster than other zero-shot speech synthesis systems while maintaining comparable performance in terms of voice quality and similarity. Furthermore, FlashSpeech demonstrates its versatility by efficiently performing tasks like voice conversion, speech editing, and diverse speech sampling.

Automated Multi-Language to English Machine Translation Using Generative Pre-Trained Transformers,"Elijah Pelofske, Vincent Urias, Lorie M. Liebrock","The task of accurate and efficient language translation is an extremely important information processing task. Machine learning enabled and automated translation that is accurate and fast is often a large topic of interest in the machine learning and data science communities. In this study, we examine using local Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models to perform automated zero shot black-box, sentence wise, multi-natural-language translation into English text. We benchmark 16 different open-source GPT models, with no custom fine-tuning, from the Huggingface LLM repository for translating 50 different non-English languages into English using translated TED Talk transcripts as the reference dataset. These GPT model inference calls are performed strictly locally, on single A100 Nvidia GPUs.

NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution,"Ansong Ni, Miltiadis Allamanis, Arman Cohan, Yinlin Deng, Kensen Shi, Charles Sutton, Pengcheng Yin","A fundamental skill among human developers is the ability to understand and reason about program execution. As an example, a programmer can mentally simulate code execution in natural language to debug and repair code (aka. rubber duck debugging). However, large language models (LLMs) of code are typically trained on the surface textual form of programs, thus may lack a semantic understanding of how programs execute at run-time. To address this issue, we propose NExT, a method to teach LLMs to inspect the execution traces of programs (variable states of executed lines) and reason about their run-time behavior through chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales. Specifically, NExT uses self-training to bootstrap a synthetic training set of execution-aware rationales that lead to correct task solutions (e.g., fixed programs) without laborious manual annotation. Experiments on program repair tasks based on MBPP and HumanEval demonstrate that NExT improves the fix rate of a PaLM 2 model, by 26.1% and 14.3% absolute, respectively, with significantly improved rationale quality as verified by automated metrics and human raters. Our model can also generalize to scenarios where program traces are absent at test-time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14662v1,2024-04
Learning Word Embedding with Better Distance Weighting and Window Size Scheduling,"Chaohao Yang, Chris Ding","Distributed word representation (a.k.a. word embedding) is a key focus in natural language processing (NLP). As a highly successful word embedding model, Word2Vec offers an efficient method for learning distributed word representations on large datasets. However, Word2Vec lacks consideration for distances between center and context words. We propose two novel methods, Learnable Formulated Weights (LFW) and Epoch-based Dynamic Window Size (EDWS), to incorporate distance information into two variants of Word2Vec, the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Continuous Skip-gram (Skip-gram) model. For CBOW, LFW uses a formula with learnable parameters that best reflects the relationship of influence and distance between words to calculate distance-related weights for average pooling, providing insights for future NLP text modeling research. For Skip-gram, we improve its dynamic window size strategy to introduce distance information in a more balanced way. Experiments prove the effectiveness of LFW and EDWS in enhancing Word2Vec's performance, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14631v2,2024-04

Diverging from prior practices that only provide model weights and inference code, and pre-train on private datasets, our release includes the complete framework for training and evaluation of the language model on publicly available datasets, including training logs, multiple checkpoints, and pre-training configurations. We also release code to convert models to MLX library for inference and fine-tuning on Apple devices. This comprehensive release aims to empower and strengthen the open research community, paving the way for future open research endeavors.   Our source code along with pre-trained model weights and training recipes is available at \url{https://github.com/apple/corenet}. Additionally, \model models can be found on HuggingFace at: \url{https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14619v2,2024-04
Hybrid LLM: Cost-Efficient and Quality-Aware Query Routing,"Dujian Ding, Ankur Mallick, Chi Wang, Robert Sim, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Victor Ruhle, Laks V. S. Lakshmanan, Ahmed Hassan Awadallah","Large language models (LLMs) excel in most NLP tasks but also require expensive cloud servers for deployment due to their size, while smaller models that can be deployed on lower cost (e.g., edge) devices, tend to lag behind in terms of response quality. Therefore in this work we propose a hybrid inference approach which combines their respective strengths to save cost and maintain quality. Our approach uses a router that assigns queries to the small or large model based on the predicted query difficulty and the desired quality level. The desired quality level can be tuned dynamically at test time to seamlessly trade quality for cost as per the scenario requirements. In experiments our approach allows us to make up to 40% fewer calls to the large model, with no drop in response quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14618v1,2024-04
Q-Tuning: Queue-based Prompt Tuning for Lifelong Few-shot Language Learning,"Yanhui Guo, Shaoyuan Xu, Jinmiao Fu, Jia Liu, Chaosheng Dong, Bryan Wang","This paper introduces \textbf{Q-tuning}, a novel approach for continual prompt tuning that enables the lifelong learning of a pre-trained language model. When learning a new task, Q-tuning trains a task-specific prompt by adding it to a prompt queue consisting of the prompts from older tasks. To better transfer the knowledge of old tasks, we design an adaptive knowledge aggregation technique that reweighs previous prompts in the queue with a learnable low-rank matrix. Once the prompt queue reaches its maximum capacity, we leverage a PCA-based eviction rule to reduce the queue's size, allowing the newly trained prompt to be added while preserving the primary knowledge of old tasks. In order to mitigate the accumulation of information loss caused by the eviction, we additionally propose a globally shared prefix prompt and a memory retention regularization based on information theory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods substantially on continual prompt tuning benchmarks. Moreover, our approach enables lifelong learning on linearly growing task sequences while requiring constant complexity for training and inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14607v1,2024-04
Describe-then-Reason: Improving Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning through Visual Comprehension Training,"Mengzhao Jia, Zhihan Zhang, Wenhao Yu, Fangkai Jiao, Meng Jiang","Open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in various tasks involving textual and visual inputs but still struggle with complex multimodal mathematical reasoning, lagging behind proprietary models like GPT-4V(ision) and Gemini-Pro. Although fine-tuning with intermediate steps (i.e., rationales) elicits some mathematical reasoning skills, the resulting models still fall short in visual comprehension due to inadequate visual-centric supervision, which leads to inaccurate interpretation of math figures. To address this issue, we propose a two-step training pipeline VCAR, which emphasizes the Visual Comprehension training in Addition to mathematical Reasoning learning. It first improves the visual comprehension ability of MLLMs through the visual description generation task, followed by another training step on generating rationales with the assistance of descriptions. Experimental results on two popular benchmarks demonstrate that VCAR substantially outperforms baseline methods solely relying on rationale supervision, especially on problems with high visual demands.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14604v3,2024-04
Planning Ahead in Generative Retrieval: Guiding Autoregressive Generation through Simultaneous Decoding,"Hansi Zeng, Chen Luo, Hamed Zamani","This paper introduces PAG-a novel optimization and decoding approach that guides autoregressive generation of document identifiers in generative retrieval models through simultaneous decoding. To this aim, PAG constructs a set-based and sequential identifier for each document. Motivated by the bag-of-words assumption in information retrieval, the set-based identifier is built on lexical tokens. The sequential identifier, on the other hand, is obtained via quantizing relevance-based representations of documents. Extensive experiments on MSMARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track data reveal that PAG outperforms the state-of-the-art generative retrieval model by a large margin (e.g., 15.6% MRR improvements on MS MARCO), while achieving 22x speed up in terms of query latency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14600v1,2024-04
WangLab at MEDIQA-M3G 2024: Multimodal Medical Answer Generation using Large Language Models,"Ronald Xie, Steven Palayew, Augustin Toma, Gary Bader, Bo Wang","This paper outlines our submission to the MEDIQA2024 Multilingual and Multimodal Medical Answer Generation (M3G) shared task. We report results for two standalone solutions under the English category of the task, the first involving two consecutive API calls to the Claude 3 Opus API and the second involving training an image-disease label joint embedding in the style of CLIP for image classification. These two solutions scored 1st and 2nd place respectively on the competition leaderboard, substantially outperforming the next best solution. Additionally, we discuss insights gained from post-competition experiments. While the performance of these two solutions have significant room for improvement due to the difficulty of the shared task and the challenging nature of medical visual question answering in general, we identify the multi-stage LLM approach and the CLIP image classification approach as promising avenues for further investigation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14567v1,2024-04
WangLab at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Optimized LLM-based Programs for Medical Error Detection and Correction,"Augustin Toma, Ronald Xie, Steven Palayew, Patrick R. Lawler, Bo Wang","Medical errors in clinical text pose significant risks to patient safety. The MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task focuses on detecting and correcting these errors across three subtasks: identifying the presence of an error, extracting the erroneous sentence, and generating a corrected sentence. In this paper, we present our approach that achieved top performance in all three subtasks. For the MS dataset, which contains subtle errors, we developed a retrieval-based system leveraging external medical question-answering datasets. For the UW dataset, reflecting more realistic clinical notes, we created a pipeline of modules to detect, localize, and correct errors. Both approaches utilized the DSPy framework for optimizing prompts and few-shot examples in large language model (LLM) based programs. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM based programs for medical error correction. However, our approach has limitations in addressing the full diversity of potential errors in medical documentation. We discuss the implications of our work and highlight future research directions to advance the robustness and applicability of medical error detection and correction systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14544v1,2024-04
SpaceByte: Towards Deleting Tokenization from Large Language Modeling,Kevin Slagle,"Tokenization is widely used in large language models because it significantly improves performance. However, tokenization imposes several disadvantages, such as performance biases, increased adversarial vulnerability, decreased character-level modeling performance, and increased modeling complexity. To address these disadvantages without sacrificing performance, we propose SpaceByte, a novel byte-level decoder architecture that closes the performance gap between byte-level and subword autoregressive language modeling. SpaceByte consists of a byte-level Transformer model, but with extra larger transformer blocks inserted in the middle of the layers. We find that performance is significantly improved by applying these larger blocks only after certain bytes, such as space characters, which typically denote word boundaries. Our experiments show that for a fixed training and inference compute budget, SpaceByte outperforms other byte-level architectures and roughly matches the performance of tokenized Transformer architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14408v3,2024-04
RTP-LX: Can LLMs Evaluate Toxicity in Multilingual Scenarios?,"Adrian de Wynter, Ishaan Watts, Tua Wongsangaroonsri, Minghui Zhang, Noura Farra, Nektar Ege Altıntoprak, Lena Baur, Samantha Claudet, Pavel Gajdusek, Can Gören, Qilong Gu, Anna Kaminska, Tomasz Kaminski, Ruby Kuo, Akiko Kyuba, Jongho Lee, Kartik Mathur, Petter Merok, Ivana Milovanović, Nani Paananen, Vesa-Matti Paananen, Anna Pavlenko, Bruno Pereira Vidal, Luciano Strika, Yueh Tsao, Davide Turcato, Oleksandr Vakhno, Judit Velcsov, Anna Vickers, Stéphanie Visser, Herdyan Widarmanto, Andrey Zaikin, Si-Qing Chen","Large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) are being adopted at remarkable speed, although their safety still remains a serious concern. With the advent of multilingual S/LLMs, the question now becomes a matter of scale: can we expand multilingual safety evaluations of these models with the same velocity at which they are deployed? To this end, we introduce RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages. RTP-LX follows participatory design practices, and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally-specific toxic language. We evaluate 10 S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual scenario. We find that, although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy, they have low agreement with human judges when scoring holistically the toxicity of a prompt; and have difficulty discerning harm in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microaggressions, bias). We release this dataset to contribute to further reduce harmful uses of these models and improve their safe deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14397v2,2024-04
PARAMANU-GANITA: Language Model with Mathematical Capabilities,"Mitodru Niyogi, Arnab Bhattacharya","In this paper, we present Paramanu-Ganita, a 208 million parameter novel Auto Regressive (AR) decoder based language model on mathematics. The model is pretrained from scratch at context size of 4096 on our curated mixed mathematical corpus. We evaluate our model on both perplexity metric and GSM8k mathematical benchmark. Paramanu-Ganita despite being 35 times smaller than 7B LLMs, outperformed generalist LLMs such as LLaMa-1 7B by 28.4% points, LLaMa-2 7B by 27.6% points, Falcon 7B by 32.6% points, PaLM 8B by 35.3% points, and math specialised LLMs such as Minerva 8B by 23.2% points, and LLEMMA-7B by 3.0% points in GSM8k test accuracy metric respectively. Paramanu-Ganita also outperformed giant LLMs like PaLM 62B by 6.4% points, Falcon 40B by 19.8% points, LLaMa-1 33B by 3.8% points and Vicuna 13B by 11.8% points respectively. The large significant margin improvement in performance of our math model over the existing LLMs signifies that reasoning capabilities of language model are just not restricted to LLMs with humongous number of parameters. Paramanu-Ganita took 146 hours of A100 training whereas math specialised LLM, LLEMMA 7B, was trained for 23,000 A100 hours of training equivalent. Thus, our approach of pretraining powerful domain specialised language models from scratch for domain adaptation is much more cost-effective than performing continual training of LLMs for domain adaptation. Hence, we conclude that for strong mathematical reasoning abilities of language model, we do not need giant LLMs and immense computing power to our end. In the end, we want to point out that we have only trained Paramanu-Ganita only on a part of our entire mathematical corpus and yet to explore the full potential of our model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14395v1,2024-04
A Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent,"Tamar Rott Shaham, Sarah Schwettmann, Franklin Wang, Achyuta Rajaram, Evan Hernandez, Jacob Andreas, Antonio Torralba","This paper describes MAIA, a Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent. MAIA is a system that uses neural models to automate neural model understanding tasks like feature interpretation and failure mode discovery. It equips a pre-trained vision-language model with a set of tools that support iterative experimentation on subcomponents of other models to explain their behavior. These include tools commonly used by human interpretability researchers: for synthesizing and editing inputs, computing maximally activating exemplars from real-world datasets, and summarizing and describing experimental results. Interpretability experiments proposed by MAIA compose these tools to describe and explain system behavior. We evaluate applications of MAIA to computer vision models. We first characterize MAIA's ability to describe (neuron-level) features in learned representations of images. Across several trained models and a novel dataset of synthetic vision neurons with paired ground-truth descriptions, MAIA produces descriptions comparable to those generated by expert human experimenters. We then show that MAIA can aid in two additional interpretability tasks: reducing sensitivity to spurious features, and automatically identifying inputs likely to be mis-classified.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14394v1,2024-04
A Survey on Self-Evolution of Large Language Models,"Zhengwei Tao, Ting-En Lin, Xiancai Chen, Hangyu Li, Yuchuan Wu, Yongbin Li, Zhi Jin, Fei Huang, Dacheng Tao, Jingren Zhou","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in various fields and intelligent agent applications. However, current LLMs that learn from human or external model supervision are costly and may face performance ceilings as task complexity and diversity increase. To address this issue, self-evolution approaches that enable LLM to autonomously acquire, refine, and learn from experiences generated by the model itself are rapidly growing. This new training paradigm inspired by the human experiential learning process offers the potential to scale LLMs towards superintelligence. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of self-evolution approaches in LLMs. We first propose a conceptual framework for self-evolution and outline the evolving process as iterative cycles composed of four phases: experience acquisition, experience refinement, updating, and evaluation. Second, we categorize the evolution objectives of LLMs and LLM-based agents; then, we summarize the literature and provide taxonomy and insights for each module. Lastly, we pinpoint existing challenges and propose future directions to improve self-evolution frameworks, equipping researchers with critical insights to fast-track the development of self-evolving LLMs. Our corresponding GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/Awesome-Self-Evolution-of-LLM",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14387v2,2024-04
SnapKV: LLM Knows What You are Looking for Before Generation,"Yuhong Li, Yingbing Huang, Bowen Yang, Bharat Venkitesh, Acyr Locatelli, Hanchen Ye, Tianle Cai, Patrick Lewis, Deming Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in processing extensive contexts, with the Key-Value (KV) cache playing a vital role in enhancing their performance. However, the growth of the KV cache in response to increasing input length poses challenges to memory and time efficiency. To address this problem, this paper introduces SnapKV, an innovative and fine-tuning-free approach that efficiently minimizes KV cache size while still delivering comparable performance in real-world applications.   We discover that each attention head in the model consistently focuses on specific prompt attention features during generation. Meanwhile, this robust pattern can be obtained from an 'observation' window located at the end of the prompts. Drawing on this insight, SnapKV automatically compresses KV caches by selecting clustered important KV positions for each attention head. Our approach significantly reduces the growing computational overhead and memory footprint when processing long input sequences. Specifically, SnapKV achieves a consistent decoding speed with a 3.6x increase in generation speed and an 8.2x enhancement in memory efficiency compared to the baseline when processing inputs of 16K tokens. At the same time, it maintains comparable performance to the baseline models across 16 long sequence datasets. Moreover, SnapKV can process up to 380K context tokens on a single A100-80GB GPU using HuggingFace implementation with minor changes, exhibiting only a negligible accuracy drop in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test. Further comprehensive studies suggest SnapKV's potential for practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14469v2,2024-04
Less Peaky and More Accurate CTC Forced Alignment by Label Priors,"Ruizhe Huang, Xiaohui Zhang, Zhaoheng Ni, Li Sun, Moto Hira, Jeff Hwang, Vimal Manohar, Vineel Pratap, Matthew Wiesner, Shinji Watanabe, Daniel Povey, Sanjeev Khudanpur","Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) models are known to have peaky output distributions. Such behavior is not a problem for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but it can cause inaccurate forced alignments (FA), especially at finer granularity, e.g., phoneme level. This paper aims at alleviating the peaky behavior for CTC and improve its suitability for forced alignment generation, by leveraging label priors, so that the scores of alignment paths containing fewer blanks are boosted and maximized during training. As a result, our CTC model produces less peaky posteriors and is able to more accurately predict the offset of the tokens besides their onset. It outperforms the standard CTC model and a heuristics-based approach for obtaining CTC's token offset timestamps by 12-40% in phoneme and word boundary errors (PBE and WBE) measured on the Buckeye and TIMIT data. Compared with the most widely used FA toolkit Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA), our method performs similarly on PBE/WBE on Buckeye, yet falls behind MFA on TIMIT. Nevertheless, our method has a much simpler training pipeline and better runtime efficiency.

Goebbert, Seth N. Lyman, Corey K. Potvin, Adam J. Stepanek","Generative AI, such as OpenAI's GPT-4V large-language model, has rapidly entered mainstream discourse. Novel capabilities in image processing and natural-language communication may augment existing forecasting methods. Large language models further display potential to better communicate weather hazards in a style honed for diverse communities and different languages. This study evaluates GPT-4V's ability to interpret meteorological charts and communicate weather hazards appropriately to the user, despite challenges of hallucinations, where generative AI delivers coherent, confident, but incorrect responses. We assess GPT-4V's competence via its web interface ChatGPT in two tasks: (1) generating a severe-weather outlook from weather-chart analysis and conducting self-evaluation, revealing an outlook that corresponds well with a Storm Prediction Center human-issued forecast; and (2) producing hazard summaries in Spanish and English from weather charts. Responses in Spanish, however, resemble direct (not idiomatic) translations from English to Spanish, yielding poorly translated summaries that lose critical idiomatic precision required for optimal communication.

Beyond Scaling: Predicting Patent Approval with Domain-specific Fine-grained Claim Dependency Graph,"Xiaochen Kev Gao, Feng Yao, Kewen Zhao, Beilei He, Animesh Kumar, Vish Krishnan, Jingbo Shang","Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs). However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel. In this paper, we delve into the patent approval pre-diction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data. Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up. Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text. As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly. We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs. Our source code and dataset can be obtained from http://github.com/ShangDataLab/FLAN-Graph.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14372v1,2024-04
Graphic Design with Large Multimodal Model,"Yutao Cheng, Zhao Zhang, Maoke Yang, Hui Nie, Chunyuan Li, Xinglong Wu, Jie Shao","In the field of graphic design, automating the integration of design elements into a cohesive multi-layered artwork not only boosts productivity but also paves the way for the democratization of graphic design. One existing practice is Graphic Layout Generation (GLG), which aims to layout sequential design elements. It has been constrained by the necessity for a predefined correct sequence of layers, thus limiting creative potential and increasing user workload. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG) as a more flexible and pragmatic setup, which creates graphic composition from unordered sets of design elements. To tackle the HLG task, we introduce Graphist, the first layout generation model based on large multimodal models. Graphist efficiently reframes the HLG as a sequence generation problem, utilizing RGB-A images as input, outputs a JSON draft protocol, indicating the coordinates, size, and order of each element. We develop new evaluation metrics for HLG. Graphist outperforms prior arts and establishes a strong baseline for this field.

Better Synthetic Data by Retrieving and Transforming Existing Datasets,"Saumya Gandhi, Ritu Gala, Vijay Viswanathan, Tongshuang Wu, Graham Neubig","Despite recent advances in large language models, building dependable and deployable NLP models typically requires abundant, high-quality training data. However, task-specific data is not available for many use cases, and manually curating task-specific data is labor-intensive. Recent work has studied prompt-driven synthetic data generation using large language models, but these generated datasets tend to lack complexity and diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce a method, DataTune, to make better use of existing, publicly available datasets to improve automatic dataset generation. DataTune performs dataset transformation, enabling the repurposing of publicly available datasets into a format that is directly aligned with the specific requirements of target tasks. On a diverse set of language-based tasks from the BIG-Bench benchmark, we find that finetuning language models via DataTune improves over a few-shot prompting baseline by 49% and improves over existing methods that use synthetic or retrieved training data by 34%. We find that dataset transformation significantly increases the diversity and difficulty of generated data on many tasks.

Zero-shot Cross-lingual Stance Detection via Adversarial Language Adaptation,"Bharathi A, Arkaitz Zubiaga","Stance detection has been widely studied as the task of determining if a social media post is positive, negative or neutral towards a specific issue, such as support towards vaccines. Research in stance detection has however often been limited to a single language and, where more than one language has been studied, research has focused on few-shot settings, overlooking the challenges of developing a zero-shot cross-lingual stance detection model. This paper makes the first such effort by introducing a novel approach to zero-shot cross-lingual stance detection, Multilingual Translation-Augmented BERT (MTAB), aiming to enhance the performance of a cross-lingual classifier in the absence of explicit training data for target languages. Our technique employs translation augmentation to improve zero-shot performance and pairs it with adversarial learning to further boost model efficacy. Through experiments on datasets labeled for stance towards vaccines in four languages English, German, French, Italian. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, showcasing improved results in comparison to a strong baseline model as well as ablated versions of our model. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of model components, not least the translation-augmented data as well as the adversarial learning component, to the improved performance of the model.

Performance Characterization of Expert Router for Scalable LLM Inference,"Josef Pichlmeier, Philipp Ross, Andre Luckow","Large Language Models (LLMs) have experienced widespread adoption across scientific and industrial domains due to their versatility and utility for diverse tasks. Nevertheless, deploying and serving these models at scale with optimal throughput and latency remains a significant challenge, primarily because of LLMs' high computational and memory demands. Specialized models optimized for specific tasks can be combined through a routing mechanism to address these challenges, creating a modular inference system. This paper introduces Expert Router, a scalable routing architecture that directs prompts to specialized expert models. We characterize multiple Expert Router configurations, including different LLama 3 models with quantized and non-quantized weights under up to 1,000 concurrent users. Our findings reveal that Expert Router introduces minimal latency overhead, with the configuration of expert models being a dominating factor in performance outcomes. High-parameter expert models deliver stable throughput and latency under moderate concurrency levels.

Automated Long Answer Grading with RiceChem Dataset,"Shashank Sonkar, Kangqi Ni, Lesa Tran Lu, Kristi Kincaid, John S. Hutchinson, Richard G. Baraniuk","We introduce a new area of study in the field of educational Natural Language Processing: Automated Long Answer Grading (ALAG). Distinguishing itself from Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) and Automated Essay Grading (AEG), ALAG presents unique challenges due to the complexity and multifaceted nature of fact-based long answers. To study ALAG, we introduce RiceChem, a dataset derived from a college chemistry course, featuring real student responses to long-answer questions with an average word count notably higher than typical ASAG datasets. We propose a novel approach to ALAG by formulating it as a rubric entailment problem, employing natural language inference models to verify whether each criterion, represented by a rubric item, is addressed in the student's response. This formulation enables the effective use of MNLI for transfer learning, significantly improving the performance of models on the RiceChem dataset. We demonstrate the importance of rubric-based formulation in ALAG, showcasing its superiority over traditional score-based approaches in capturing the nuances of student responses. We also investigate the performance of models in cold start scenarios, providing valuable insights into the practical deployment considerations in educational settings. Lastly, we benchmark state-of-the-art open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) on RiceChem and compare their results to GPT models, highlighting the increased complexity of ALAG compared to ASAG. Despite leveraging the benefits of a rubric-based approach and transfer learning from MNLI, the lower performance of LLMs on RiceChem underscores the significant difficulty posed by the ALAG task. With this work, we offer a fresh perspective on grading long, fact-based answers and introduce a new dataset to stimulate further research in this important area.

Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information: Learning to Follow Principles without Preference Labels,"Jan-Philipp Fränken, Eric Zelikman, Rafael Rafailov, Kanishk Gandhi, Tobias Gerstenberg, Noah D. Goodman","When prompting a language model (LM), users often expect the model to adhere to a set of behavioral principles across diverse tasks, such as producing insightful content while avoiding harmful or biased language. Instilling such principles (i.e., a constitution) into a model is resource-intensive, technically challenging, and generally requires human preference labels or examples. We introduce SAMI, an iterative algorithm that finetunes a pretrained language model (without requiring preference labels or demonstrations) to increase the conditional mutual information between constitutions and self-generated responses given queries from a dataset. On single-turn dialogue and summarization, a SAMI-trained mistral-7b outperforms the initial pretrained model, with win rates between 66% and 77%. Strikingly, it also surpasses an instruction-finetuned baseline (mistral-7b-instruct) with win rates between 55% and 57% on single-turn dialogue. SAMI requires a model that writes the principles. To avoid dependence on strong models for writing principles, we align a strong pretrained model (mixtral-8x7b) using constitutions written by a weak instruction-finetuned model (mistral-7b-instruct), achieving a 65% win rate on summarization. Finally, we investigate whether SAMI generalizes to diverse summarization principles (e.g., ""summaries should be scientific"") and scales to stronger models (llama3-70b), finding that it achieves win rates of up to 68% for learned and 67% for held-out principles compared to the base model. Our results show that a pretrained LM can learn to follow constitutions without using preference labels, demonstrations, or human oversight.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14313v2,2024-04
Marking: Visual Grading with Highlighting Errors and Annotating Missing Bits,"Shashank Sonkar, Naiming Liu, Debshila B. Mallick, Richard G. Baraniuk","In this paper, we introduce ""Marking"", a novel grading task that enhances automated grading systems by performing an in-depth analysis of student responses and providing students with visual highlights. Unlike traditional systems that provide binary scores, ""marking"" identifies and categorizes segments of the student response as correct, incorrect, or irrelevant and detects omissions from gold answers. We introduce a new dataset meticulously curated by Subject Matter Experts specifically for this task. We frame ""Marking"" as an extension of the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task, which is extensively explored in the field of Natural Language Processing. The gold answer and the student response play the roles of premise and hypothesis in NLI, respectively. We subsequently train language models to identify entailment, contradiction, and neutrality from student response, akin to NLI, and with the added dimension of identifying omissions from gold answers.

A Survey on Efficient Inference for Large Language Models,"Zixuan Zhou, Xuefei Ning, Ke Hong, Tianyu Fu, Jiaming Xu, Shiyao Li, Yuming Lou, Luning Wang, Zhihang Yuan, Xiuhong Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Yuhan Dong, Yu Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted extensive attention due to their remarkable performance across various tasks. However, the substantial computational and memory requirements of LLM inference pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios. Efforts within the field have been directed towards developing techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency of LLM inference. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on efficient LLM inference. We start by analyzing the primary causes of the inefficient LLM inference, i.e., the large model size, the quadratic-complexity attention operation, and the auto-regressive decoding approach. Then, we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the current literature into data-level, model-level, and system-level optimization. Moreover, the paper includes comparative experiments on representative methods within critical sub-fields to provide quantitative insights. Last but not least, we provide some knowledge summary and discuss future research directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14294v3,2024-04
What do Transformers Know about Government?,"Jue Hou, Anisia Katinskaia, Lari Kotilainen, Sathianpong Trangcasanchai, Anh-Duc Vu, Roman Yangarber","This paper investigates what insights about linguistic features and what knowledge about the structure of natural language can be obtained from the encodings in transformer language models.In particular, we explore how BERT encodes the government relation between constituents in a sentence. We use several probing classifiers, and data from two morphologically rich languages. Our experiments show that information about government is encoded across all transformer layers, but predominantly in the early layers of the model. We find that, for both languages, a small number of attention heads encode enough information about the government relations to enable us to train a classifier capable of discovering new, previously unknown types of government, never seen in the training data. Currently, data is lacking for the research community working on grammatical constructions, and government in particular. We release the Government Bank -- a dataset defining the government relations for thousands of lemmas in the languages in our experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14270v1,2024-04
Detecting and Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision Language Models via Fine-Grained AI Feedback,"Wenyi Xiao, Ziwei Huang, Leilei Gan, Wanggui He, Haoyuan Li, Zhelun Yu, Fangxun Shu, Hao Jiang, Linchao Zhu","The rapidly developing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have shown notable capabilities on a range of multi-modal tasks, but still face the hallucination phenomena where the generated texts do not align with the given contexts, significantly restricting the usages of LVLMs. Most previous work detects and mitigates hallucination at the coarse-grained level or requires expensive annotation (e.g., labeling by proprietary models or human experts). To address these issues, we propose detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs via fine-grained AI feedback. The basic idea is that we generate a small-size sentence-level hallucination annotation dataset by proprietary models, whereby we train a hallucination detection model which can perform sentence-level hallucination detection, covering primary hallucination types (i.e., object, attribute, and relationship). Then, we propose a detect-then-rewrite pipeline to automatically construct preference dataset for training hallucination mitigating model. Furthermore, we propose differentiating the severity of hallucinations, and introducing a Hallucination Severity-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (HSA-DPO) for mitigating hallucination in LVLMs by incorporating the severity of hallucinations into preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14233v2,2024-04

Text-Tuple-Table: Towards Information Integration in Text-to-Table Generation via Global Tuple Extraction,"Zheye Deng, Chunkit Chan, Weiqi Wang, Yuxi Sun, Wei Fan, Tianshi Zheng, Yauwai Yim, Yangqiu Song","The task of condensing large chunks of textual information into concise and structured tables has gained attention recently due to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential benefit for downstream tasks, such as text summarization and text mining. Previous approaches often generate tables that directly replicate information from the text, limiting their applicability in broader contexts, as text-to-table generation in real-life scenarios necessitates information extraction, reasoning, and integration. However, there is a lack of both datasets and methodologies towards this task. In this paper, we introduce LiveSum, a new benchmark dataset created for generating summary tables of competitions based on real-time commentary texts. We evaluate the performances of state-of-the-art LLMs on this task in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, and additionally propose a novel pipeline called $T^3$(Text-Tuple-Table) to improve their performances. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LLMs still struggle with this task even after fine-tuning, while our approach can offer substantial performance gains without explicit training. Further analyses demonstrate that our method exhibits strong generalization abilities, surpassing previous approaches on several other text-to-table datasets.

EnzChemRED consists of 1,210 expert curated PubMed abstracts in which enzymes and the chemical reactions they catalyze are annotated using identifiers from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) and the ontology of Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI).

Swap distance minimization beyond entropy minimization in word order variation,"Víctor Franco-Sánchez, Arnau Martí-Llobet, Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho","Here we consider the problem of all the possible orders of a linguistic structure formed by $n$ elements, for instance, subject, direct object and verb ($n=3$) or subject, direct object, indirect object and verb ($n=4$). We investigate if the frequency of the $n!$ possible orders is constrained by two principles. First, entropy minimization, a principle that has been suggested to shape natural communication systems at distinct levels of organization. Second, swap distance minimization, namely a preference for word orders that require fewer swaps of adjacent elements to be produced from a source order. Here we present average swap distance, a novel score for research on swap distance minimization, and investigate the theoretical distribution of that score for any $n$: its minimum and maximum values and its expected value in die rolling experiments or when the word order frequencies are shuffled. We investigate whether entropy and average swap distance are significantly small in distinct linguistic structures with $n=3$ or $n=4$ in agreement with the corresponding minimization principles. We find strong evidence of entropy minimization and swap distance minimization with respect to a die rolling experiment. The evidence of these two forces with respect to a Polya urn process is strong for $n=4$ but weaker for $n=3$. We still find evidence of swap distance minimization when word order frequencies are shuffled, indicating that swap distance minimization effects are beyond pressure to minimize word order entropy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14192v4,2024-04

Fine-Tuning Large Language Models to Translate: Will a Touch of Noisy Data in Misaligned Languages Suffice?,"Dawei Zhu, Pinzhen Chen, Miaoran Zhang, Barry Haddow, Xiaoyu Shen, Dietrich Klakow","Traditionally, success in multilingual machine translation can be attributed to three key factors in training data: large volume, diverse translation directions, and high quality. In the current practice of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for translation, we revisit the importance of these factors. We find that LLMs display strong translation capability after being fine-tuned on as few as 32 parallel sentences and that fine-tuning on a single translation direction enables translation in multiple directions. However, the choice of direction is critical: fine-tuning LLMs with only English on the target side can lead to task misinterpretation, which hinders translation into non-English languages. Problems also arise when noisy synthetic data is placed on the target side, especially when the target language is well-represented in LLM pre-training. Yet interestingly, synthesized data in an under-represented language has a less pronounced effect. Our findings suggest that when adapting LLMs to translation, the requirement on data quantity can be eased but careful considerations are still crucial to prevent an LLM from exploiting unintended data biases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14122v2,2024-04

Bored to Death: Artificial Intelligence Research Reveals the Role of Boredom in Suicide Behavior,"Shir Lissak, Yaakov Ophir, Refael Tikochinski, Anat Brunstein Klomek, Itay Sisso, Eyal Fruchter, Roi Reichart","Background: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) contributed significantly to suicide assessment, however, our theoretical understanding of this complex behavior is still limited. Objective: This study aimed to harness AI methodologies to uncover hidden risk factors that trigger or aggravate suicide behaviors. Method: The primary dataset included 228,052 Facebook postings by 1,006 users who completed the gold-standard Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. This dataset was analyzed using a bottom-up research pipeline without a-priory hypotheses and its findings were validated using a top-down analysis of a new dataset. This secondary dataset included responses by 1,062 participants to the same suicide scale as well as to well-validated scales measuring depression and boredom. Results: An almost fully automated, AI-guided research pipeline resulted in four Facebook topics that predicted the risk of suicide, of which the strongest predictor was boredom. A comprehensive literature review using APA PsycInfo revealed that boredom is rarely perceived as a unique risk factor of suicide. A complementing top-down path analysis of the secondary dataset uncovered an indirect relationship between boredom and suicide, which was mediated by depression. An equivalent mediated relationship was observed in the primary Facebook dataset as well. However, here, a direct relationship between boredom and suicide risk was also observed. Conclusions: Integrating AI methods allowed the discovery of an under-researched risk factor of suicide. The study signals boredom as a maladaptive 'ingredient' that might trigger suicide behaviors, regardless of depression. Further studies are recommended to direct clinicians' attention to this burdening, and sometimes existential experience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14057v2,2024-04
Differential contributions of machine learning and statistical analysis to language and cognitive sciences,"Kun Sun, Rong Wang","Data-driven approaches have revolutionized scientific research, with machine learning and statistical analysis being commonly used methodologies. Despite their widespread use, these approaches differ significantly in their techniques, objectives and implementations. Few studies have systematically applied both methods to identical datasets to highlight potential differences, particularly in language and cognitive sciences. This study employs the Buckeye Speech Corpus to illustrate how machine learning and statistical analysis are applied in data-driven research to obtain distinct insights on language production. We demonstrate the theoretical differences, implementation steps, and unique objectives of each approach through a comprehensive, tutorial-like comparison. Our analysis reveals that while machine learning excels at pattern recognition and prediction, statistical methods provide deeper insights into relationships between variables. The study highlights how semantic relevance, a novel metric measuring contextual influence on target words, contributes to understanding word duration in speech. We also systematically compare the differences between regression models used in machine learning and statistical analysis, particularly focusing on the training and fitting processes. Additionally, we clarify several common misconceptions that contribute to the confusion between these two approaches. Overall, by elucidating the complementary strengths of machine learning and statistics, this research enhances our understanding of diverse data-driven strategies in language and cognitive sciences, offering researchers valuable guidance on when and how to effectively apply these approaches in different research contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14052v2,2024-04
LLMs Know What They Need: Leveraging a Missing Information Guided Framework to Empower Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Keheng Wang, Feiyu Duan, Peiguang Li, Sirui Wang, Xunliang Cai","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demonstrates great value in alleviating outdated knowledge or hallucination by supplying LLMs with updated and relevant knowledge. However, there are still several difficulties for RAG in understanding complex multi-hop query and retrieving relevant documents, which require LLMs to perform reasoning and retrieve step by step. Inspired by human's reasoning process in which they gradually search for the required information, it is natural to ask whether the LLMs could notice the missing information in each reasoning step. In this work, we first experimentally verified the ability of LLMs to extract information as well as to know the missing. Based on the above discovery, we propose a Missing Information Guided Retrieve-Extraction-Solving paradigm (MIGRES), where we leverage the identification of missing information to generate a targeted query that steers the subsequent knowledge retrieval. Besides, we design a sentence-level re-ranking filtering approach to filter the irrelevant content out from document, along with the information extraction capability of LLMs to extract useful information from cleaned-up documents, which in turn to bolster the overall efficacy of RAG. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public datasets reveal the superiority of the proposed MIGRES method, and analytical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14043v1,2024-04
Exploring neural oscillations during speech perception via surrogate gradient spiking neural networks,"Alexandre Bittar, Philip N. Garner","Understanding cognitive processes in the brain demands sophisticated models capable of replicating neural dynamics at large scales. We present a physiologically inspired speech recognition architecture, compatible and scalable with deep learning frameworks, and demonstrate that end-to-end gradient descent training leads to the emergence of neural oscillations in the central spiking neural network. Significant cross-frequency couplings, indicative of these oscillations, are measured within and across network layers during speech processing, whereas no such interactions are observed when handling background noise inputs. Furthermore, our findings highlight the crucial inhibitory role of feedback mechanisms, such as spike frequency adaptation and recurrent connections, in regulating and synchronising neural activity to improve recognition performance. Overall, on top of developing our understanding of synchronisation phenomena notably observed in the human auditory pathway, our architecture exhibits dynamic and efficient information processing, with relevance to neuromorphic technology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14024v2,2024-04
Tree of Reviews: A Tree-based Dynamic Iterative Retrieval Framework for Multi-hop Question Answering,"Li Jiapeng, Liu Runze, Li Yabo, Zhou Tong, Li Mingling, Chen Xiang","Multi-hop question answering is a knowledge-intensive complex problem. Large Language Models (LLMs) use their Chain of Thoughts (CoT) capability to reason complex problems step by step, and retrieval-augmentation can effectively alleviate factual errors caused by outdated and unknown knowledge in LLMs. Recent works have introduced retrieval-augmentation in the CoT reasoning to solve multi-hop question answering. However, these chain methods have the following problems: 1) Retrieved irrelevant paragraphs may mislead the reasoning; 2) An error in the chain structure may lead to a cascade of errors.   In this paper, we propose a dynamic retrieval framework called Tree of Reviews (ToR), where the root node is the question, and the other nodes are paragraphs from retrieval, extending different reasoning paths from the root node to other nodes. Our framework dynamically decides to initiate a new search, reject, or accept based on the paragraphs on the reasoning paths. Compared to related work, we introduce a tree structure to handle each retrieved paragraph separately, alleviating the misleading effect of irrelevant paragraphs on the reasoning path; the diversity of reasoning path extension reduces the impact of a single reasoning error on the whole. We conducted experiments on three different multi-hop question answering datasets. The results show that compared to the baseline methods, ToR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both retrieval and response generation. In addition, we propose two tree-based search optimization strategies, pruning and effective expansion, to reduce time overhead and increase the diversity of path extension. We will release our code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14464v1,2024-04
DAIC-WOZ: On the Validity of Using the Therapist's prompts in Automatic Depression Detection from Clinical Interviews,"Sergio Burdisso, Ernesto Reyes-Ramírez, Esaú Villatoro-Tello, Fernando Sánchez-Vega, Pastor López-Monroy, Petr Motlicek","Automatic depression detection from conversational data has gained significant interest in recent years. The DAIC-WOZ dataset, interviews conducted by a human-controlled virtual agent, has been widely used for this task. Recent studies have reported enhanced performance when incorporating interviewer's prompts into the model. In this work, we hypothesize that this improvement might be mainly due to a bias present in these prompts, rather than the proposed architectures and methods. Through ablation experiments and qualitative analysis, we discover that models using interviewer's prompts learn to focus on a specific region of the interviews, where questions about past experiences with mental health issues are asked, and use them as discriminative shortcuts to detect depressed participants. In contrast, models using participant responses gather evidence from across the entire interview. Finally, to highlight the magnitude of this bias, we achieve a 0.90 F1 score by intentionally exploiting it, the highest result reported to date on this dataset using only textual information. Our findings underline the need for caution when incorporating interviewers' prompts into models, as they may inadvertently learn to exploit targeted prompts, rather than learning to characterize the language and behavior that are genuinely indicative of the patient's mental health condition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14463v1,2024-04
Information Re-Organization Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Xiaoxia Cheng, Zeqi Tan, Wei Xue, Weiming Lu","Improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) has attracted considerable interest. Recent approaches primarily focus on improving the reasoning process to yield a more precise final answer. However, in scenarios involving contextually aware reasoning, these methods neglect the importance of first identifying logical relationships from the context before proceeding with the reasoning. This oversight could lead to a superficial understanding and interaction with the context, potentially undermining the quality and reliability of the reasoning outcomes. In this paper, we propose an information re-organization (InfoRE) method before proceeding with the reasoning to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs. Our re-organization method involves initially extracting logical relationships from the contextual content, such as documents or paragraphs, and subsequently pruning redundant content to minimize noise. Then, we utilize the re-organized information in the reasoning process. This enables LLMs to deeply understand the contextual content by clearly perceiving these logical relationships, while also ensuring high-quality responses by eliminating potential noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the reasoning ability, we conduct experiments using Llama2-70B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on various contextually aware multi-hop reasoning tasks. Using only a zero-shot setting, our method achieves an average absolute improvement of 4% across all tasks, highlighting its potential to improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Our source code is available at https://github.com/hustcxx/InfoRE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13985v2,2024-04

Protecting Your LLMs with Information Bottleneck,"Zichuan Liu, Zefan Wang, Linjie Xu, Jinyu Wang, Lei Song, Tianchun Wang, Chunlin Chen, Wei Cheng, Jiang Bian","The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, yet they might be attacked to produce harmful content. Despite efforts to ethically align LLMs, these are often fragile and can be circumvented by jailbreaking attacks through optimized or manual adversarial prompts. To address this, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Protector (IBProtector), a defense mechanism grounded in the information bottleneck principle, and we modify the objective to avoid trivial solutions. The IBProtector selectively compresses and perturbs prompts, facilitated by a lightweight and trainable extractor, preserving only essential information for the target LLMs to respond with the expected answer. Moreover, we further consider a situation where the gradient is not visible to be compatible with any LLM. Our empirical evaluations show that IBProtector outperforms current defense methods in mitigating jailbreak attempts, without overly affecting response quality or inference speed. Its effectiveness and adaptability across various attack methods and target LLMs underscore the potential of IBProtector as a novel, transferable defense that bolsters the security of LLMs without requiring modifications to the underlying models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13968v3,2024-04
How Well Can LLMs Echo Us? Evaluating AI Chatbots' Role-Play Ability with ECHO,"Man Tik Ng, Hui Tung Tse, Jen-tse Huang, Jingjing Li, Wenxuan Wang, Michael R. Lyu","The role-play ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a popular research direction. However, existing studies focus on imitating well-known public figures or fictional characters, overlooking the potential for simulating ordinary individuals. Such an oversight limits the potential for advancements in digital human clones and non-player characters in video games. To bridge this gap, we introduce ECHO, an evaluative framework inspired by the Turing test. This framework engages the acquaintances of the target individuals to distinguish between human and machine-generated responses. Notably, our framework focuses on emulating average individuals rather than historical or fictional figures, presenting a unique advantage to apply the Turing Test. We evaluated three role-playing LLMs using ECHO, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 serving as foundational models, alongside the online application GPTs from OpenAI. Our results demonstrate that GPT-4 more effectively deceives human evaluators, and GPTs achieves a leading success rate of 48.3%. Furthermore, we investigated whether LLMs could discern between human-generated and machine-generated texts. While GPT-4 can identify differences, it could not determine which texts were human-produced. Our code and results of reproducing the role-playing LLMs are made publicly available via https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/ECHO.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13957v1,2024-04
Typos that Broke the RAG's Back: Genetic Attack on RAG Pipeline by Simulating Documents in the Wild via Low-level Perturbations,"Sukmin Cho, Soyeong Jeong, Jeongyeon Seo, Taeho Hwang, Jong C. Park","The robustness of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial as their applicability expands across various domains and real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution for addressing the limitations of LLMs, yet existing studies on the robustness of RAG often overlook the interconnected relationships between RAG components or the potential threats prevalent in real-world databases, such as minor textual errors. In this work, we investigate two underexplored aspects when assessing the robustness of RAG: 1) vulnerability to noisy documents through low-level perturbations and 2) a holistic evaluation of RAG robustness. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attack method, the Genetic Attack on RAG (\textit{GARAG}), which targets these aspects. Specifically, GARAG is designed to reveal vulnerabilities within each component and test the overall system functionality against noisy documents. We validate RAG robustness by applying our \textit{GARAG} to standard QA datasets, incorporating diverse retrievers and LLMs. The experimental results show that GARAG consistently achieves high attack success rates. Also, it significantly devastates the performance of each component and their synergy, highlighting the substantial risk that minor textual inaccuracies pose in disrupting RAG systems in the real world.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13948v2,2024-04
A User-Centric Multi-Intent Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models,"Jiayin Wang, Fengran Mo, Weizhi Ma, Peijie Sun, Min Zhang, Jian-Yun Nie","Large language models (LLMs) are essential tools that users employ across various scenarios, so evaluating their performance and guiding users in selecting the suitable service is important. Although many benchmarks exist, they mainly focus on specific predefined model abilities, such as world knowledge, reasoning, etc. Based on these ability scores, it is hard for users to determine which LLM best suits their particular needs. To address these issues, we propose to evaluate LLMs from a user-centric perspective and design this benchmark to measure their efficacy in satisfying user needs under distinct intents. Firstly, we collect 1,846 real-world use cases from a user study with 712 participants from 23 countries. This first-hand data helps us understand actual user intents and needs in LLM interactions, forming the User Reported Scenarios (URS) dataset, which is categorized with six types of user intents. Secondly, based on this authentic dataset, we benchmark 10 LLM services with GPT-4-as-Judge. Thirdly, we show that benchmark scores align well with human preference in both real-world experience and pair-wise annotations, achieving Pearson correlations of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively.

SemEval-2024 Task 9: BRAINTEASER: A Novel Task Defying Common Sense,"Yifan Jiang, Filip Ilievski, Kaixin Ma","While vertical thinking relies on logical and commonsense reasoning, lateral thinking requires systems to defy commonsense associations and overwrite them through unconventional thinking. Lateral thinking has been shown to be challenging for current models but has received little attention. A recent benchmark, BRAINTEASER, aims to evaluate current models' lateral thinking ability in a zero-shot setting. In this paper, we split the original benchmark to also support fine-tuning setting and present SemEval Task 9: BRAIN-TEASER(S), the first task at this competition designed to test the system's reasoning and lateral thinking ability. As a popular task, BRAINTEASER(S)'s two subtasks receive 483 team submissions from 182 participants during the competition. This paper provides a fine-grained system analysis of the competition results, together with a reflection on what this means for the ability of the systems to reason laterally. We hope that the BRAINTEASER(S) subtasks and findings in this paper can stimulate future work on lateral thinking and robust reasoning by computational models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16068v1,2024-04
MARIO Eval: Evaluate Your Math LLM with your Math LLM--A mathematical dataset evaluation toolkit,"Boning Zhang, Chengxi Li, Kai Fan","Large language models (LLMs) have been explored in a variety of reasoning tasks including solving of mathematical problems. Each math dataset typically includes its own specially designed evaluation script, which, while suitable for its intended use, lacks generalizability across different datasets. Consequently, updates and adaptations to these evaluation tools tend to occur without being systematically reported, leading to inconsistencies and obstacles to fair comparison across studies. To bridge this gap, we introduce a comprehensive mathematical evaluation toolkit that not only utilizes a python computer algebra system (CAS) for its numerical accuracy, but also integrates an optional LLM, known for its considerable natural language processing capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of our toolkit, we manually annotated two distinct datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that the toolkit yields more robust evaluation results compared to prior works, even without an LLM. Furthermore, when an LLM is incorporated, there is a notable enhancement. The code for our method will be made available at \url{https://github.com/MARIO-Math-Reasoning/math_evaluation}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13925v1,2024-04
Navigating the Path of Writing: Outline-guided Text Generation with Large Language Models,"Yukyung Lee, Soonwon Ka, Bokyung Son, Pilsung Kang, Jaewook Kang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the writing process, enabling collaborative content creation and enhancing productivity. However, generating high-quality, user-aligned text remains challenging. In this paper, we propose Writing Path, a framework that uses explicit outlines to guide LLMs in generating goal-oriented, high-quality pieces of writing. Our approach draws inspiration from structured writing planning and reasoning paths, focusing on capturing and reflecting user intentions throughout the writing process. We construct a diverse dataset from unstructured blog posts to benchmark writing performance and introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework assessing the quality of outlines and generated texts. Our evaluations with GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and HyperCLOVA X demonstrate that the Writing Path approach significantly enhances text quality according to both LLMs and human evaluations. This study highlights the potential of integrating writing-specific techniques into LLMs to enhance their ability to meet the diverse writing needs of users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13919v1,2024-04
Generating Attractive and Authentic Copywriting from Customer Reviews,"Yu-Xiang Lin, Wei-Yun Ma","The goal of product copywriting is to capture the interest of potential buyers by emphasizing the features of products through text descriptions. As e-commerce platforms offer a wide range of services, it's becoming essential to dynamically adjust the styles of these auto-generated descriptions. Typical approaches to copywriting generation often rely solely on specified product attributes, which may result in dull and repetitive content. To tackle this issue, we propose to generate copywriting based on customer reviews, as they provide firsthand practical experiences with products, offering a richer source of information than just product attributes. We have developed a sequence-to-sequence framework, enhanced with reinforcement learning, to produce copywriting that is attractive, authentic, and rich in information. Our framework outperforms all existing baseline and zero-shot large language models, including LLaMA-2-chat-7B and GPT-3.5, in terms of both attractiveness and faithfulness. Furthermore, this work features the use of LLMs for aspect-based summaries collection and argument allure assessment. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of using LLMs for marketing domain corpus construction.

Yet despite their promise, the best way to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex medical tasks remains an open question. We introduce a novel multi-agent framework, named Medical Decision-making Agents (MDAgents) that helps address this gap by automatically assigning a collaboration structure to a team of LLMs. The assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the medical task at hand, emulating real-world medical decision-making processes adapted to tasks of varying complexities. We evaluate our framework and baseline methods using state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of real-world medical knowledge and medical diagnosis benchmarks, including a comparison of LLMs' medical complexity classification against human physicians. MDAgents achieved the best performance in seven out of ten benchmarks on tasks requiring an understanding of medical knowledge and multi-modal reasoning, showing a significant improvement of up to 4.2% (p < 0.05) compared to previous methods' best performances. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents effectively determines medical complexity to optimize for efficiency and accuracy across diverse medical tasks. Notably, the combination of moderator review and external medical knowledge in group collaboration resulted in an average accuracy improvement of 11.8%.

Towards Better Text-to-Image Generation Alignment via Attention Modulation,"Yihang Wu, Xiao Cao, Kaixin Li, Zitan Chen, Haonan Wang, Lei Meng, Zhiyong Huang","In text-to-image generation tasks, the advancements of diffusion models have facilitated the fidelity of generated results. However, these models encounter challenges when processing text prompts containing multiple entities and attributes. The uneven distribution of attention results in the issues of entity leakage and attribute misalignment. Training from scratch to address this issue requires numerous labeled data and is resource-consuming. Motivated by this, we propose an attribution-focusing mechanism, a training-free phase-wise mechanism by modulation of attention for diffusion model. One of our core ideas is to guide the model to concentrate on the corresponding syntactic components of the prompt at distinct timesteps. To achieve this, we incorporate a temperature control mechanism within the early phases of the self-attention modules to mitigate entity leakage issues. An object-focused masking scheme and a phase-wise dynamic weight control mechanism are integrated into the cross-attention modules, enabling the model to discern the affiliation of semantic information between entities more effectively. The experimental results in various alignment scenarios demonstrate that our model attain better image-text alignment with minimal additional computational cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13899v1,2024-04
Surveying Attitudinal Alignment Between Large Language Models Vs. Humans Towards 17 Sustainable Development Goals,"Qingyang Wu, Ying Xu, Tingsong Xiao, Yunze Xiao, Yitong Li, Tianyang Wang, Yichi Zhang, Shanghai Zhong, Yuwei Zhang, Wei Lu, Yifan Yang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potent tools for advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the attitudinal disparities between LLMs and humans towards these goals can pose significant challenges. This study conducts a comprehensive review and analysis of the existing literature on the attitudes of LLMs towards the 17 SDGs, emphasizing the comparison between their attitudes and support for each goal and those of humans. We examine the potential disparities, primarily focusing on aspects such as understanding and emotions, cultural and regional differences, task objective variations, and factors considered in the decision-making process. These disparities arise from the underrepresentation and imbalance in LLM training data, historical biases, quality issues, lack of contextual understanding, and skewed ethical values reflected. The study also investigates the risks and harms that may arise from neglecting the attitudes of LLMs towards the SDGs, including the exacerbation of social inequalities, racial discrimination, environmental destruction, and resource wastage. To address these challenges, we propose strategies and recommendations to guide and regulate the application of LLMs, ensuring their alignment with the principles and goals of the SDGs, and therefore creating a more just, inclusive, and sustainable future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13885v1,2024-04
Competition Report: Finding Universal Jailbreak Backdoors in Aligned LLMs,"Javier Rando, Francesco Croce, Kryštof Mitka, Stepan Shabalin, Maksym Andriushchenko, Nicolas Flammarion, Florian Tramèr","Large language models are aligned to be safe, preventing users from generating harmful content like misinformation or instructions for illegal activities. However, previous work has shown that the alignment process is vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Adversaries can manipulate the safety training data to inject backdoors that act like a universal sudo command: adding the backdoor string to any prompt enables harmful responses from models that, otherwise, behave safely. Our competition, co-located at IEEE SaTML 2024, challenged participants to find universal backdoors in several large language models. This report summarizes the key findings and promising ideas for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14461v2,2024-04
VALOR-EVAL: Holistic Coverage and Faithfulness Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models,"Haoyi Qiu, Wenbo Hu, Zi-Yi Dou, Nanyun Peng","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from hallucination issues, wherein the models generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect outputs, undermining their reliability. A comprehensive quantitative evaluation is necessary to identify and understand the extent of hallucinations in these models. However, existing benchmarks are often limited in scope, focusing mainly on object hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods struggle to effectively address the subtle semantic distinctions between model outputs and reference data, as well as the balance between hallucination and informativeness. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-dimensional benchmark covering objects, attributes, and relations, with challenging images selected based on associative biases. Moreover, we propose a large language model (LLM)-based two-stage evaluation framework that generalizes the popular CHAIR metric and incorporates both faithfulness and coverage into the evaluation. Experiments on 10 established LVLMs demonstrate that our evaluation metric is more comprehensive and better correlated with humans than existing work when evaluating on our challenging human-annotated benchmark dataset. Our work also highlights the critical balance between faithfulness and coverage of model outputs, and encourages future works to address hallucinations in LVLMs while keeping their outputs informative.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13874v4,2024-04
Context-Enhanced Language Models for Generating Multi-Paper Citations,"Avinash Anand, Kritarth Prasad, Ujjwal Goel, Mohit Gupta, Naman Lal, Astha Verma, Rajiv Ratn Shah","Citation text plays a pivotal role in elucidating the connection between scientific documents, demanding an in-depth comprehension of the cited paper. Constructing citations is often time-consuming, requiring researchers to delve into extensive literature and grapple with articulating relevant content. To address this challenge, the field of citation text generation (CTG) has emerged. However, while earlier methods have primarily centered on creating single-sentence citations, practical scenarios frequently necessitate citing multiple papers within a single paragraph. To bridge this gap, we propose a method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate multi-citation sentences. Our approach involves a single source paper and a collection of target papers, culminating in a coherent paragraph containing multi-sentence citation text. Furthermore, we introduce a curated dataset named MCG-S2ORC, composed of English-language academic research papers in Computer Science, showcasing multiple citation instances. In our experiments, we evaluate three LLMs LLaMA, Alpaca, and Vicuna to ascertain the most effective model for this endeavor. Additionally, we exhibit enhanced performance by integrating knowledge graphs from target papers into the prompts for generating citation text. This research underscores the potential of harnessing LLMs for citation generation, opening a compelling avenue for exploring the intricate connections between scientific documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13865v1,2024-04
Understanding the role of FFNs in driving multilingual behaviour in LLMs,"Sunit Bhattacharya, Ondřej Bojar","Multilingualism in Large Language Models (LLMs) is an yet under-explored area. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the multilingual capabilities of a family of a Large Language Model, examining its architecture, activation patterns, and processing mechanisms across languages. We introduce novel metrics to probe the model's multilingual behaviour at different layers and shed light on the impact of architectural choices on multilingual processing.   Our findings reveal different patterns of multilinugal processing in the sublayers of Feed-Forward Networks of the models. Furthermore, we uncover the phenomenon of ""over-layerization"" in certain model configurations, where increasing layer depth without corresponding adjustments to other parameters may degrade model performance. Through comparisons within and across languages, we demonstrate the interplay between model architecture, layer depth, and multilingual processing capabilities of LLMs trained on multiple languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13855v1,2024-04
EventLens: Leveraging Event-Aware Pretraining and Cross-modal Linking Enhances Visual Commonsense Reasoning,"Mingjie Ma, Zhihuan Yu, Yichao Ma, Guohui Li","Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) is a cognitive task, challenging models to answer visual questions requiring human commonsense, and to provide rationales explaining why the answers are correct. With emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is natural and imperative to explore their applicability to VCR. However, VCR task demands more external knowledge to tackle its challenging questions, necessitating special designs to activate LLMs' commonsense reasoning abilities. Also, most existing Multimodal LLMs adopted an abstraction of entire input image, which makes it difficult to comprehend VCR's unique co-reference tags between image regions and text, posing challenges for fine-grained alignment. To address these issues, we propose EventLens that leverages Event-Aware Pretraining and Cross-modal Linking and EnhanceS VCR. First, by emulating the cognitive process of human reasoning, an Event-Aware Pretraining auxiliary task is introduced to better activate LLM's global comprehension of intricate scenarios. Second, during fine-tuning, we further utilize reference tags to bridge RoI features with texts, while preserving both modality semantics. Finally, we use instruct-style prompts to narrow the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning, and task-specific adapters to better integrate LLM's inherent knowledge with new commonsense. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed auxiliary task and fine-grained linking strategy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13847v1,2024-04
Filtered Direct Preference Optimization,"Tetsuro Morimura, Mitsuki Sakamoto, Yuu Jinnai, Kenshi Abe, Kaito Ariu","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning language models with human preferences. While the significance of dataset quality is generally recognized, explicit investigations into its impact within the RLHF framework, to our knowledge, have been limited. This paper addresses the issue of text quality within the preference dataset by focusing on direct preference optimization (DPO), an increasingly adopted reward-model-free RLHF method. We confirm that text quality significantly influences the performance of models optimized with DPO more than those optimized with reward-model-based RLHF. Building on this new insight, we propose an extension of DPO, termed filtered direct preference optimization (fDPO). fDPO uses a trained reward model to monitor the quality of texts within the preference dataset during DPO training. Samples of lower quality are discarded based on comparisons with texts generated by the model being optimized, resulting in a more accurate dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO enhances the final model performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/filtered-dpo.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13846v4,2024-04
MixLoRA: Enhancing Large Language Models Fine-Tuning with LoRA-based Mixture of Experts,"Dengchun Li, Yingzi Ma, Naizheng Wang, Zhengmao Ye, Zhiyuan Cheng, Yinghao Tang, Yan Zhang, Lei Duan, Jie Zuo, Cal Yang, Mingjie Tang","Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common practice to adapt pre-trained models for specific applications. While methods like LoRA have effectively addressed GPU memory constraints during fine-tuning, their performance often falls short, especially in multi-task scenarios. In contrast, Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models, such as Mixtral 8x7B, demonstrate remarkable performance in multi-task learning scenarios while maintaining a reduced parameter count. However, the resource requirements of these MoEs remain challenging, particularly for consumer-grade GPUs with less than 24GB memory. To tackle these challenges, we propose MixLoRA, an approach to construct a resource-efficient sparse MoE model based on LoRA. MixLoRA inserts multiple LoRA-based experts within the feed-forward network block of a frozen pre-trained dense model and employs a commonly used top-k router. Unlike other LoRA-based MoE methods, MixLoRA enhances model performance by utilizing independent attention-layer LoRA adapters. Additionally, an auxiliary load balance loss is employed to address the imbalance problem of the router. Our evaluations show that MixLoRA improves about 9% accuracy compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods in multi-task learning scenarios. We also propose a new high-throughput framework to alleviate the computation and memory bottlenecks during the training and inference of MOE models. This framework reduces GPU memory consumption by 40% and token computation latency by 30% during both training and inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15159v3,2024-04
From LLM to NMT: Advancing Low-Resource Machine Translation with Claude,"Maxim Enis, Mark Hopkins","We show that Claude 3 Opus, a large language model (LLM) released by Anthropic in March 2024, exhibits stronger machine translation competence than other LLMs. Though we find evidence of data contamination with Claude on FLORES-200, we curate new benchmarks that corroborate the effectiveness of Claude for low-resource machine translation into English. We find that Claude has remarkable \textit{resource efficiency} -- the degree to which the quality of the translation model depends on a language pair's resource level. Finally, we show that advancements in LLM translation can be compressed into traditional neural machine translation (NMT) models. Using Claude to generate synthetic data, we demonstrate that knowledge distillation advances the state-of-the-art in Yoruba-English translation, meeting or surpassing strong baselines like NLLB-54B and Google Translate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13813v1,2024-04
FASTTRACK: Fast and Accurate Fact Tracing for LLMs,"Si Chen, Feiyang Kang, Ning Yu, Ruoxi Jia","Fact tracing seeks to identify specific training examples that serve as the knowledge source for a given query. Existing approaches to fact tracing rely on assessing the similarity between each training sample and the query along a certain dimension, such as lexical similarity, gradient, or embedding space. However, these methods fall short of effectively distinguishing between samples that are merely relevant and those that actually provide supportive evidence for the information sought by the query. This limitation often results in suboptimal effectiveness. Moreover, these approaches necessitate the examination of the similarity of individual training points for each query, imposing significant computational demands and creating a substantial barrier for practical applications. This paper introduces FASTTRACK, a novel approach that harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to validate supportive evidence for queries and at the same time clusters the training database towards a reduced extent for LLMs to trace facts. Our experiments show that FASTTRACK substantially outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving more than 100\% improvement in F1 score over the state-of-the-art methods while being X33 faster than \texttt{TracIn}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15157v1,2024-04

This approach offers a very accurate representation of the sign space and keeps the number of parameters reasonably small in favor of a fast decoding. Experiments were carried out for 5177 Chinese signs. The real time isolated recognition rate is 94.8%. For continuous sign recognition, the word correct rate is 91.4%.

Counterfactual Reasoning Using Predicted Latent Personality Dimensions for Optimizing Persuasion Outcome,"Donghuo Zeng, Roberto S. Legaspi, Yuewen Sun, Xinshuai Dong, Kazushi Ikeda, Peter Spirtes, kun Zhang","Customizing persuasive conversations related to the outcome of interest for specific users achieves better persuasion results. However, existing persuasive conversation systems rely on persuasive strategies and encounter challenges in dynamically adjusting dialogues to suit the evolving states of individual users during interactions. This limitation restricts the system's ability to deliver flexible or dynamic conversations and achieve suboptimal persuasion outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel approach that tracks a user's latent personality dimensions (LPDs) during ongoing persuasion conversation and generates tailored counterfactual utterances based on these LPDs to optimize the overall persuasion outcome. In particular, our proposed method leverages a Bi-directional Generative Adversarial Network (BiCoGAN) in tandem with a Dialogue-based Personality Prediction Regression (DPPR) model to generate counterfactual data. This enables the system to formulate alternative persuasive utterances that are more suited to the user. Subsequently, we utilize the D3QN model to learn policies for optimized selection of system utterances on counterfactual data. Experimental results we obtained from using the PersuasionForGood dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the existing method, BiCoGAN. The cumulative rewards and Q-values produced by our method surpass ground truth benchmarks, showcasing the efficacy of employing counterfactual reasoning and LPDs to optimize reinforcement learning policy in online interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13792v1,2024-04
AdvPrompter: Fast Adaptive Adversarial Prompting for LLMs,"Anselm Paulus, Arman Zharmagambetov, Chuan Guo, Brandon Amos, Yuandong Tian","While recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes, they are vulnerable to certain jailbreaking attacks that lead to generation of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires finding adversarial prompts that cause such jailbreaking, e.g. by appending a suffix to a given instruction, which is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, automatic adversarial prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that can easily be detected by perplexity-based filters, may require gradient information from the TargetLLM, or do not scale well due to time-consuming discrete optimization processes over the token space. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses another LLM, called the AdvPrompter, to generate human-readable adversarial prompts in seconds, $\sim800\times$ faster than existing optimization-based approaches. We train the AdvPrompter using a novel algorithm that does not require access to the gradients of the TargetLLM. This process alternates between two steps: (1) generating high-quality target adversarial suffixes by optimizing the AdvPrompter predictions, and (2) low-rank fine-tuning of the AdvPrompter with the generated adversarial suffixes. The trained AdvPrompter generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs show state-of-the-art results on the AdvBench dataset, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLM APIs. Further, we demonstrate that by fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset generated by AdvPrompter, LLMs can be made more robust against jailbreaking attacks while maintaining performance, i.e. high MMLU scores.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16873v1,2024-04
Iteratively Prompting Multimodal LLMs to Reproduce Natural and AI-Generated Images,"Ali Naseh, Katherine Thai, Mohit Iyyer, Amir Houmansadr","With the digital imagery landscape rapidly evolving, image stocks and AI-generated image marketplaces have become central to visual media. Traditional stock images now exist alongside innovative platforms that trade in prompts for AI-generated visuals, driven by sophisticated APIs like DALL-E 3 and Midjourney. This paper studies the possibility of employing multi-modal models with enhanced visual understanding to mimic the outputs of these platforms, introducing an original attack strategy. Our method leverages fine-tuned CLIP models, a multi-label classifier, and the descriptive capabilities of GPT-4V to create prompts that generate images similar to those available in marketplaces and from premium stock image providers, yet at a markedly lower expense. In presenting this strategy, we aim to spotlight a new class of economic and security considerations within the realm of digital imagery. Our findings, supported by both automated metrics and human assessment, reveal that comparable visual content can be produced for a fraction of the prevailing market prices ($0.23 - $0.27 per image), emphasizing the need for awareness and strategic discussions about the integrity of digital media in an increasingly AI-integrated landscape. Our work also contributes to the field by assembling a dataset consisting of approximately 19 million prompt-image pairs generated by the popular Midjourney platform, which we plan to release publicly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13784v1,2024-04
Evaluating Retrieval Quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Alireza Salemi, Hamed Zamani","Evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) presents challenges, particularly for retrieval models within these systems. Traditional end-to-end evaluation methods are computationally expensive. Furthermore, evaluation of the retrieval model's performance based on query-document relevance labels shows a small correlation with the RAG system's downstream performance. We propose a novel evaluation approach, eRAG, where each document in the retrieval list is individually utilized by the large language model within the RAG system. The output generated for each document is then evaluated based on the downstream task ground truth labels. In this manner, the downstream performance for each document serves as its relevance label. We employ various downstream task metrics to obtain document-level annotations and aggregate them using set-based or ranking metrics. Extensive experiments on a wide range of datasets demonstrate that eRAG achieves a higher correlation with downstream RAG performance compared to baseline methods, with improvements in Kendall's $\tau$ correlation ranging from 0.168 to 0.494. Additionally, eRAG offers significant computational advantages, improving runtime and consuming up to 50 times less GPU memory than end-to-end evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13781v1,2024-04

We explore a multi-domain training setup for RC, and attempt to improve performance by encoding domain information. Our proposed models improve > 2 Macro-F1 against the baseline setup, and our analysis reveals that not all the labels benefit the same: The classes which occupy a similar space across domains (i.e., their interpretation is close across them, for example ""physical"") benefit the least, while domain-dependent relations (e.g., ""part-of'') improve the most when encoding domain information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13760v1,2024-04
Adversarial Representation Engineering: A General Model Editing Framework for Large Language Models,"Yihao Zhang, Zeming Wei, Jun Sun, Meng Sun","Since the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success, understanding and rectifying their internal complex mechanisms has become an urgent issue. Recent research has attempted to interpret their behaviors through the lens of inner representation. However, developing practical and efficient methods for applying these representations for general and flexible model editing remains challenging. In this work, we explore how to leverage insights from representation engineering to guide the editing of LLMs by deploying a representation sensor as an editing oracle. We first identify the importance of a robust and reliable sensor during editing, then propose an Adversarial Representation Engineering (ARE) framework to provide a unified and interpretable approach for conceptual model editing without compromising baseline performance. Experiments on multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of ARE in various model editing scenarios.

To address this challenge, we propose a simple and novel unsupervised approach to extract opinion terms and the corresponding sentiment polarity for aspect terms in a sentence. Our experimental evaluations, conducted on four benchmark datasets, demonstrate compelling performance to extract the aspect oriented opinion words as well as assigning sentiment polarity.

The Framework of a Design Process Language,Arnulf Hagen,"The thesis develops a view of design in a concept formation framework and outlines a language to describe both the object of the design and the process of designing. The unknown object at the outset of the design work may be seen as an unknown concept that the designer is to define. Throughout the process, she develops a description of this object by relating it to known concepts. The search stops when the designer is satisfied that the design specification is complete enough to satisfy the requirements from it once built. It is then a collection of propositions that all contribute towards defining the design object - a collection of sentences describing relationships between the object and known concepts. Also, the design process itself may be described by relating known concepts - by organizing known abilities into particular patterns of activation, or mobilization. In view of the demands posed to a language to use in this concept formation process, the framework of a Design Process Language (DPL) is developed. The basis for the language are linguistic categories that act as classes of relations used to combine concepts, containing relations used for describing process and object within the same general system, with some relations being process specific, others being object specific, and with the bulk being used both for process and object description. Another outcome is the distinction of modal relations, or relations describing futurity, possibility, willingness, hypothetical events, and the like. The design process almost always includes aspects such as these, and it is thus necessary for a language facilitating design process description to support such relationships to be constructed. The DPL is argued to be a foundation whereupon to build a language that can be used for enabling computers to be more useful - act more intelligently - in the design process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13721v1,2024-04
Trojan Detection in Large Language Models: Insights from The Trojan Detection Challenge,"Narek Maloyan, Ekansh Verma, Bulat Nutfullin, Bislan Ashinov","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains, but their vulnerability to trojan or backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. This paper explores the challenges and insights gained from the Trojan Detection Competition 2023 (TDC2023), which focused on identifying and evaluating trojan attacks on LLMs. We investigate the difficulty of distinguishing between intended and unintended triggers, as well as the feasibility of reverse engineering trojans in real-world scenarios. Our comparative analysis of various trojan detection methods reveals that achieving high Recall scores is significantly more challenging than obtaining high Reverse-Engineering Attack Success Rate (REASR) scores. The top-performing methods in the competition achieved Recall scores around 0.16, comparable to a simple baseline of randomly sampling sentences from a distribution similar to the given training prefixes. This finding raises questions about the detectability and recoverability of trojans inserted into the model, given only the harmful targets. Despite the inability to fully solve the problem, the competition has led to interesting observations about the viability of trojan detection and improved techniques for optimizing LLM input prompts. The phenomenon of unintended triggers and the difficulty in distinguishing them from intended triggers highlights the need for further research into the robustness and interpretability of LLMs. The TDC2023 has provided valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with trojan detection in LLMs, laying the groundwork for future research in this area to ensure their safety and reliability in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13660v1,2024-04
PEACH: Pretrained-embedding Explanation Across Contextual and Hierarchical Structure,"Feiqi Cao, Caren Han, Hyunsuk Chung","In this work, we propose a novel tree-based explanation technique, PEACH (Pretrained-embedding Explanation Across Contextual and Hierarchical Structure), that can explain how text-based documents are classified by using any pretrained contextual embeddings in a tree-based human-interpretable manner. Note that PEACH can adopt any contextual embeddings of the PLMs as a training input for the decision tree. Using the proposed PEACH, we perform a comprehensive analysis of several contextual embeddings on nine different NLP text classification benchmarks. This analysis demonstrates the flexibility of the model by applying several PLM contextual embeddings, its attribute selections, scaling, and clustering methods. Furthermore, we show the utility of explanations by visualising the feature selection and important trend of text classification via human-interpretable word-cloud-based trees, which clearly identify model mistakes and assist in dataset debugging. Besides interpretability, PEACH outperforms or is similar to those from pretrained models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13645v1,2024-04
Incorporating Different Verbal Cues to Improve Text-Based Computer-Delivered Health Messaging,Samuel Rhys Cox,"The ubiquity of smartphones has led to an increase in on demand healthcare being supplied. For example, people can share their illness-related experiences with others similar to themselves, and healthcare experts can offer advice for better treatment and care for remediable, terminal and mental illnesses. As well as this human-to-human communication, there has been an increased use of human-to-computer digital health messaging, such as chatbots. These can prove advantageous as they offer synchronous and anonymous feedback without the need for a human conversational partner. However, there are many subtleties involved in human conversation that a computer agent may not properly exhibit. For example, there are various conversational styles, etiquettes, politeness strategies or empathic responses that need to be chosen appropriately for the conversation. Encouragingly, computers are social actors (CASA) posits that people apply the same social norms to computers as they would do to people. On from this, previous studies have focused on applying conversational strategies to computer agents to make them embody more favourable human characteristics. However, if a computer agent fails in this regard it can lead to negative reactions from users. Therefore, in this dissertation we describe a series of studies we carried out to lead to more effective human-to-computer digital health messaging.   In our first study, we use the crowd [...]   Our second study investigates the effect of a health chatbot's conversational style [...]   In our final study, we investigate the format used by a chatbot when [...]   In summary, we have researched how to create more effective digital health interventions starting from generating health messages, to choosing an appropriate formality of messaging, and finally to formatting messages which reference a user's previous utterances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13633v1,2024-04

Mixture of LoRA Experts,"Xun Wu, Shaohan Huang, Furu Wei","LoRA has gained widespread acceptance in the fine-tuning of large pre-trained models to cater to a diverse array of downstream tasks, showcasing notable effectiveness and efficiency, thereby solidifying its position as one of the most prevalent fine-tuning techniques. Due to the modular nature of LoRA's plug-and-play plugins, researchers have delved into the amalgamation of multiple LoRAs to empower models to excel across various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, extant approaches for LoRA fusion grapple with inherent challenges. Direct arithmetic merging may result in the loss of the original pre-trained model's generative capabilities or the distinct identity of LoRAs, thereby yielding suboptimal outcomes. On the other hand, Reference tuning-based fusion exhibits limitations concerning the requisite flexibility for the effective combination of multiple LoRAs. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces the Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) approach, which harnesses hierarchical control and unfettered branch selection. The MoLE approach not only achieves superior LoRA fusion performance in comparison to direct arithmetic merging but also retains the crucial flexibility for combining LoRAs effectively. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted in both the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Vision & Language (V&L) domains substantiate the efficacy of MoLE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13628v1,2024-04
NegotiationToM: A Benchmark for Stress-testing Machine Theory of Mind on Negotiation Surrounding,"Chunkit Chan, Cheng Jiayang, Yauwai Yim, Zheye Deng, Wei Fan, Haoran Li, Xin Liu, Hongming Zhang, Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song","Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked substantial interest and debate concerning their potential emergence of Theory of Mind (ToM) ability. Theory of mind evaluations currently focuses on testing models using machine-generated data or game settings prone to shortcuts and spurious correlations, which lacks evaluation of machine ToM ability in real-world human interaction scenarios. This poses a pressing demand to develop new real-world scenario benchmarks. We introduce NegotiationToM, a new benchmark designed to stress-test machine ToM in real-world negotiation surrounding covered multi-dimensional mental states (i.e., desires, beliefs, and intentions). Our benchmark builds upon the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent modeling theory and conducts the necessary empirical experiments to evaluate large language models. Our findings demonstrate that NegotiationToM is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, as they consistently perform significantly worse than humans, even when employing the chain-of-thought (CoT) method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13627v3,2024-04
The Branch Not Taken: Predicting Branching in Online Conversations,"Shai Meital, Lior Rokach, Roman Vainshtein, Nir Grinberg","Multi-participant discussions tend to unfold in a tree structure rather than a chain structure. Branching may occur for multiple reasons -- from the asynchronous nature of online platforms to a conscious decision by an interlocutor to disengage with part of the conversation. Predicting branching and understanding the reasons for creating new branches is important for many downstream tasks such as summarization and thread disentanglement and may help develop online spaces that encourage users to engage in online discussions in more meaningful ways. In this work, we define the novel task of branch prediction and propose GLOBS (Global Branching Score) -- a deep neural network model for predicting branching. GLOBS is evaluated on three large discussion forums from Reddit, achieving significant improvements over an array of competitive baselines and demonstrating better transferability. We affirm that structural, temporal, and linguistic features contribute to GLOBS success and find that branching is associated with a greater number of conversation participants and tends to occur in earlier levels of the conversation tree. We publicly release GLOBS and our implementation of all baseline models to allow reproducibility and promote further research on this important task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13613v1,2024-04
Video sentence grounding with temporally global textual knowledge,"Cai Chen, Runzhong Zhang, Jianjun Gao, Kejun Wu, Kim-Hui Yap, Yi Wang","Temporal sentence grounding involves the retrieval of a video moment with a natural language query. Many existing works directly incorporate the given video and temporally localized query for temporal grounding, overlooking the inherent domain gap between different modalities. In this paper, we utilize pseudo-query features containing extensive temporally global textual knowledge sourced from the same video-query pair, to enhance the bridging of domain gaps and attain a heightened level of similarity between multi-modal features. Specifically, we propose a Pseudo-query Intermediary Network (PIN) to achieve an improved alignment of visual and comprehensive pseudo-query features within the feature space through contrastive learning. Subsequently, we utilize learnable prompts to encapsulate the knowledge of pseudo-queries, propagating them into the textual encoder and multi-modal fusion module, further enhancing the feature alignment between visual and language for better temporal grounding.

"""A good pun is its own reword"": Can Large Language Models Understand Puns?","Zhijun Xu, Siyu Yuan, Lingjie Chen, Deqing Yang","Puns play a vital role in academic research due to their distinct structure and clear definition, which aid in the comprehensive analysis of linguistic humor. However, the understanding of puns in large language models (LLMs) has not been thoroughly examined, limiting their use in creative writing and humor creation. In this paper, we leverage three popular tasks, i.e., pun recognition, explanation and generation to systematically evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in pun understanding. In addition to adopting the automated evaluation metrics from prior research, we introduce new evaluation methods and metrics that are better suited to the in-context learning paradigm of LLMs. These new metrics offer a more rigorous assessment of an LLM's ability to understand puns and align more closely with human cognition than previous metrics. Our findings reveal the ""lazy pun generation"" pattern and identify the primary challenges LLMs encounter in understanding puns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13599v2,2024-04

Socratic Planner: Inquiry-Based Zero-Shot Planning for Embodied Instruction Following,"Suyeon Shin, Sujin jeon, Junghyun Kim, Gi-Cheon Kang, Byoung-Tak Zhang","Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is the task of executing natural language instructions by navigating and interacting with objects in 3D environments. One of the primary challenges in EIF is compositional task planning, which is often addressed with supervised or in-context learning with labeled data. To this end, we introduce the Socratic Planner, the first zero-shot planning method that infers without the need for any training data. Socratic Planner first decomposes the instructions into substructural information of the task through self-questioning and answering, translating it into a high-level plan, i.e., a sequence of subgoals. Subgoals are executed sequentially, with our visually grounded re-planning mechanism adjusting plans dynamically through a dense visual feedback. We also introduce an evaluation metric of high-level plans, RelaxedHLP, for a more comprehensive evaluation. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Socratic Planner, achieving competitive performance on both zero-shot and few-shot task planning in the ALFRED benchmark, particularly excelling in tasks requiring higher-dimensional inference. Additionally, a precise adjustments in the plan were achieved by incorporating environmental visual information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15190v1,2024-04

Leveraging a balanced VQA dataset, we investigate three distinct strategies. Firstly, GAN-based approaches aim to generate answer embeddings conditioned on image and question inputs, showing potential but struggling with more complex tasks. Secondly, autoencoder-based techniques focus on learning optimal embeddings for questions and images, achieving comparable results with GAN due to better ability on complex questions. Lastly, attention mechanisms, incorporating Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB), address language priors and attention modeling, albeit with a complexity-performance trade-off. This study underscores the challenges and opportunities in VQA and suggests avenues for future research, including alternative GAN formulations and attentional mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13565v3,2024-04
ChatRetriever: Adapting Large Language Models for Generalized and Robust Conversational Dense Retrieval,"Kelong Mao, Chenlong Deng, Haonan Chen, Fengran Mo, Zheng Liu, Tetsuya Sakai, Zhicheng Dou","Conversational search requires accurate interpretation of user intent from complex multi-turn contexts. This paper presents ChatRetriever, which inherits the strong generalization capability of large language models to robustly represent complex conversational sessions for dense retrieval. To achieve this, we propose a simple and effective dual-learning approach that adapts LLM for retrieval via contrastive learning while enhancing the complex session understanding through masked instruction tuning on high-quality conversational instruction tuning data. Extensive experiments on five conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that ChatRetriever substantially outperforms existing conversational dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on par with LLM-based rewriting approaches.

Listen Then See: Video Alignment with Speaker Attention,"Aviral Agrawal, Carlos Mateo Samudio Lezcano, Iqui Balam Heredia-Marin, Prabhdeep Singh Sethi","Video-based Question Answering (Video QA) is a challenging task and becomes even more intricate when addressing Socially Intelligent Question Answering (SIQA). SIQA requires context understanding, temporal reasoning, and the integration of multimodal information, but in addition, it requires processing nuanced human behavior. Furthermore, the complexities involved are exacerbated by the dominance of the primary modality (text) over the others. Thus, there is a need to help the task's secondary modalities to work in tandem with the primary modality. In this work, we introduce a cross-modal alignment and subsequent representation fusion approach that achieves state-of-the-art results (82.06\% accuracy) on the Social IQ 2.0 dataset for SIQA. Our approach exhibits an improved ability to leverage the video modality by using the audio modality as a bridge with the language modality. This leads to enhanced performance by reducing the prevalent issue of language overfitting and resultant video modality bypassing encountered by current existing techniques.

EPI-SQL: Enhancing Text-to-SQL Translation with Error-Prevention Instructions,"Xiping Liu, Zhao Tan","The conversion of natural language queries into SQL queries, known as Text-to-SQL, is a critical yet challenging task. This paper introduces EPI-SQL, a novel methodological framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the performance of Text-to-SQL tasks. EPI-SQL operates through a four-step process. Initially, the method involves gathering instances from the Spider dataset on which LLMs are prone to failure. These instances are then utilized to generate general error-prevention instructions (EPIs). Subsequently, LLMs craft contextualized EPIs tailored to the specific context of the current task. Finally, these context-specific EPIs are incorporated into the prompt used for SQL generation. EPI-SQL is distinguished in that it provides task-specific guidance, enabling the model to circumvent potential errors for the task at hand. Notably, the methodology rivals the performance of advanced few-shot methods despite being a zero-shot approach. An empirical assessment using the Spider benchmark reveals that EPI-SQL achieves an execution accuracy of 85.1\%, underscoring its effectiveness in generating accurate SQL queries through LLMs. The findings indicate a promising direction for future research, i.e. enhancing instructions with task-specific and contextualized rules, for boosting LLMs' performance in NLP tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14453v1,2024-04

We propose IMO: Invariant features Masks for Out-of-Distribution text classification, to achieve OOD generalization by learning invariant features. During training, IMO would learn sparse mask layers to remove irrelevant features for prediction, where the remaining features keep invariant.

"Do ""English"" Named Entity Recognizers Work Well on Global Englishes?","Alexander Shan, John Bauer, Riley Carlson, Christopher Manning","The vast majority of the popular English named entity recognition (NER) datasets contain American or British English data, despite the existence of many global varieties of English. As such, it is unclear whether they generalize for analyzing use of English globally. To test this, we build a newswire dataset, the Worldwide English NER Dataset, to analyze NER model performance on low-resource English variants from around the world. We test widely used NER toolkits and transformer models, including models using the pre-trained contextual models RoBERTa and ELECTRA, on three datasets: a commonly used British English newswire dataset, CoNLL 2003, a more American focused dataset OntoNotes, and our global dataset. All models trained on the CoNLL or OntoNotes datasets experienced significant performance drops-over 10 F1 in some cases-when tested on the Worldwide English dataset. Upon examination of region-specific errors, we observe the greatest performance drops for Oceania and Africa, while Asia and the Middle East had comparatively strong performance. Lastly, we find that a combined model trained on the Worldwide dataset and either CoNLL or OntoNotes lost only 1-2 F1 on both test sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13465v1,2024-04
Fine-Grained Named Entities for Corona News,"Sefika Efeoglu, Adrian Paschke","Information resources such as newspapers have produced unstructured text data in various languages related to the corona outbreak since December 2019. Analyzing these unstructured texts is time-consuming without representing them in a structured format; therefore, representing them in a structured format is crucial. An information extraction pipeline with essential tasks -- named entity tagging and relation extraction -- to accomplish this goal might be applied to these texts. This study proposes a data annotation pipeline to generate training data from corona news articles, including generic and domain-specific entities.

Intrusion Detection at Scale with the Assistance of a Command-line Language Model,"Jiongliang Lin, Yiwen Guo, Hao Chen","Intrusion detection is a long standing and crucial problem in security. A system capable of detecting intrusions automatically is on great demand in enterprise security solutions. Existing solutions rely heavily on hand-crafted rules designed by security operators, which suffer from high false negative rates and poor generalization ability to new, zero-day attacks at scale. AI and machine learning offer promising solutions to address the issues, by inspecting abnormal user behaviors intelligently and automatically from data. However, existing learning-based intrusion detection systems in the literature are mostly designed for small data, and they lack the ability to leverage the power of big data in cloud environments. In this paper, we target at this problem and introduce an intrusion detection system which incorporates large-scale pre-training, so as to train a large language model based on tens of millions of command lines for AI-based intrusion detection. Experiments performed on 30 million training samples and 10 million test samples verify the effectiveness of our solution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13402v1,2024-04
Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based Relation Extraction,"Sefika Efeoglu, Adrian Paschke","Information Extraction (IE) is a transformative process that converts unstructured text data into a structured format by employing entity and relation extraction (RE) methodologies. The identification of the relation between a pair of entities plays a crucial role within this framework. Despite the existence of various techniques for relation extraction, their efficacy heavily relies on access to labeled data and substantial computational resources. In addressing these challenges, Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising solutions; however, they might return hallucinating responses due to their own training data. To overcome these limitations, Retrieved-Augmented Generation-based Relation Extraction (RAG4RE) in this work is proposed, offering a pathway to enhance the performance of relation extraction tasks.   This work evaluated the effectiveness of our RAG4RE approach utilizing different LLMs. Through the utilization of established benchmarks, such as TACRED, TACREV, Re-TACRED, and SemEval RE datasets, our aim is to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of our RAG4RE approach. In particularly, we leverage prominent LLMs including Flan T5, Llama2, and Mistral in our investigation. The results of our study demonstrate that our RAG4RE approach surpasses performance of traditional RE approaches based solely on LLMs, particularly evident in the TACRED dataset and its variations.

Explanation based Bias Decoupling Regularization for Natural Language Inference,"Jianxiang Zang, Hui Liu","The robustness of Transformer-based Natural Language Inference encoders is frequently compromised as they tend to rely more on dataset biases than on the intended task-relevant features. Recent studies have attempted to mitigate this by reducing the weight of biased samples during the training process. However, these debiasing methods primarily focus on identifying which samples are biased without explicitly determining the biased components within each case. This limitation restricts those methods' capability in out-of-distribution inference. To address this issue, we aim to train models to adopt the logic humans use in explaining causality. We propose a simple, comprehensive, and interpretable method: Explanation based Bias Decoupling Regularization (EBD-Reg). EBD-Reg employs human explanations as criteria, guiding the encoder to establish a tripartite parallel supervision of Distinguishing, Decoupling and Aligning. This method enables encoders to identify and focus on keywords that represent the task-relevant features during inference, while discarding the residual elements acting as biases. Empirical evidence underscores that EBD-Reg effectively guides various Transformer-based encoders to decouple biases through a human-centric lens, significantly surpassing other methods in terms of out-of-distribution inference capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13390v1,2024-04

This research endeavors to bridge the gap of the absence of efficient QnA datasets in low-resource languages by translating the English Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) using a robust data curation approach. We introduce MahaSQuAD, the first-ever full SQuAD dataset for the Indic language Marathi, consisting of 118,516 training, 11,873 validation, and 11,803 test samples. We also present a gold test set of manually verified 500 examples. Challenges in maintaining context and handling linguistic nuances are addressed, ensuring accurate translations. Moreover, as a QnA dataset cannot be simply converted into any low-resource language using translation, we need a robust method to map the answer translation to its span in the translated passage. Hence, to address this challenge, we also present a generic approach for translating SQuAD into any low-resource language. Thus, we offer a scalable approach to bridge linguistic and cultural gaps present in low-resource languages, in the realm of question-answering systems.

Semantically Corrected Amharic Automatic Speech Recognition,"Samuael Adnew, Paul Pu Liang","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) can play a crucial role in enhancing the accessibility of spoken languages worldwide. In this paper, we build a set of ASR tools for Amharic, a language spoken by more than 50 million people primarily in eastern Africa. Amharic is written in the Ge'ez script, a sequence of graphemes with spacings denoting word boundaries. This makes computational processing of Amharic challenging since the location of spacings can significantly impact the meaning of formed sentences. We find that existing benchmarks for Amharic ASR do not account for these spacings and only measure individual grapheme error rates, leading to significantly inflated measurements of in-the-wild performance. In this paper, we first release corrected transcriptions of existing Amharic ASR test datasets, enabling the community to accurately evaluate progress. Furthermore, we introduce a post-processing approach using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to organize raw ASR outputs into a grammatically complete and semantically meaningful Amharic sentence. Through experiments on the corrected test dataset, our model enhances the semantic correctness of Amharic speech recognition systems, achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 5.5\% and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 23.3\%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13362v1,2024-04
Swa Bhasha: Message-Based Singlish to Sinhala Transliteration,"Maneesha U. Athukorala, Deshan K. Sumanathilaka","Machine Transliteration provides the ability to transliterate a basic language into different languages in a computational way. Transliteration is an important technical process that has caught the attention most recently. The Sinhala transliteration has many constraints because of the insufficiency of resources in the Sinhala language. Due to these limitations, Sinhala Transliteration is highly complex and time-consuming. Therefore, the majority of the Sri Lankans uses non-formal texting language named 'Singlish' to make that process simple. This study has focused on the transliteration of the Singlish language at the word level by reducing the complication in the transliteration. A new approach of coding system has invented with the rule-based approach that can map the matching Sinhala words even without the vowels. Various typing patterns were collected by different communities for this. The collected data have analyzed with every Sinhala character and unique Singlish patterns related to them were generated. The system has introduced a newly initiated numeric coding system to use with the Singlish letters by matching with the recognized typing patterns. For the mapping process, fuzzy logic-based implementation has used. A codified dictionary has also implemented including unique numeric values. In this system, Each Romanized English letter was assigned with a unique numeric code that can construct a unique pattern for each word. The system can identify the most relevant Sinhala word that matches with the pattern of the Singlish word or it gives the most related word suggestions. For example, the word 'kiyanna,kianna, kynna, kynn, kiynna' have mapped with the accurate Sinhala word ""kiyanna"".

UnibucLLM: Harnessing LLMs for Automated Prediction of Item Difficulty and Response Time for Multiple-Choice Questions,"Ana-Cristina Rogoz, Radu Tudor Ionescu","This work explores a novel data augmentation method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting item difficulty and response time of retired USMLE Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) in the BEA 2024 Shared Task. Our approach is based on augmenting the dataset with answers from zero-shot LLMs (Falcon, Meditron, Mistral) and employing transformer-based models based on six alternative feature combinations. The results suggest that predicting the difficulty of questions is more challenging. Notably, our top performing methods consistently include the question text, and benefit from the variability of LLM answers, highlighting the potential of LLMs for improving automated assessment in medical licensing exams. We make our code available https://github.com/ana-rogoz/BEA-2024.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13343v1,2024-04
A Multi-Faceted Evaluation Framework for Assessing Synthetic Data Generated by Large Language Models,"Yefeng Yuan, Yuhong Liu, Liang Cheng","The rapid advancements in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have opened up new avenues for producing synthetic data, particularly in the realm of structured tabular formats, such as product reviews. Despite the potential benefits, concerns regarding privacy leakage have surfaced, especially when personal information is utilized in the training datasets. In addition, there is an absence of a comprehensive evaluation framework capable of quantitatively measuring the quality of the generated synthetic data and their utility for downstream tasks. In response to this gap, we introduce SynEval, an open-source evaluation framework designed to assess the fidelity, utility, and privacy preservation of synthetically generated tabular data via a suite of diverse evaluation metrics. We validate the efficacy of our proposed framework - SynEval - by applying it to synthetic product review data generated by three state-of-the-art LLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, and Llama. Our experimental findings illuminate the trade-offs between various evaluation metrics in the context of synthetic data generation. Furthermore, SynEval stands as a critical instrument for researchers and practitioners engaged with synthetic tabular data,, empowering them to judiciously determine the suitability of the generated data for their specific applications, with an emphasis on upholding user privacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14445v1,2024-04
Beyond Accuracy: Investigating Error Types in GPT-4 Responses to USMLE Questions,"Soumyadeep Roy, Aparup Khatua, Fatemeh Ghoochani, Uwe Hadler, Wolfgang Nejdl, Niloy Ganguly","GPT-4 demonstrates high accuracy in medical QA tasks, leading with an accuracy of 86.70%, followed by Med-PaLM 2 at 86.50%. However, around 14% of errors remain. Additionally, current works use GPT-4 to only predict the correct option without providing any explanation and thus do not provide any insight into the thinking process and reasoning used by GPT-4 or other LLMs. Therefore, we introduce a new domain-specific error taxonomy derived from collaboration with medical students. Our GPT-4 USMLE Error (G4UE) dataset comprises 4153 GPT-4 correct responses and 919 incorrect responses to the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) respectively. These responses are quite long (258 words on average), containing detailed explanations from GPT-4 justifying the selected option. We then launch a large-scale annotation study using the Potato annotation platform and recruit 44 medical experts through Prolific, a well-known crowdsourcing platform. We annotated 300 out of these 919 incorrect data points at a granular level for different classes and created a multi-label span to identify the reasons behind the error. In our annotated dataset, a substantial portion of GPT-4's incorrect responses is categorized as a ""Reasonable response by GPT-4,"" by annotators. This sheds light on the challenge of discerning explanations that may lead to incorrect options, even among trained medical professionals. We also provide medical concepts and medical semantic predications extracted using the SemRep tool for every data point. We believe that it will aid in evaluating the ability of LLMs to answer complex medical questions. We make the resources available at https://github.com/roysoumya/usmle-gpt4-error-taxonomy .",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13307v1,2024-04
Evaluating Subword Tokenization: Alien Subword Composition and OOV Generalization Challenge,"Khuyagbaatar Batsuren, Ekaterina Vylomova, Verna Dankers, Tsetsuukhei Delgerbaatar, Omri Uzan, Yuval Pinter, Gábor Bella","The popular subword tokenizers of current language models, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), are known not to respect morpheme boundaries, which affects the downstream performance of the models. While many improved tokenization algorithms have been proposed, their evaluation and cross-comparison is still an open problem. As a solution, we propose a combined intrinsic-extrinsic evaluation framework for subword tokenization. Intrinsic evaluation is based on our new UniMorph Labeller tool that classifies subword tokenization as either morphological or alien. Extrinsic evaluation, in turn, is performed via the Out-of-Vocabulary Generalization Challenge 1.0 benchmark, which consists of three newly specified downstream text classification tasks. Our empirical findings show that the accuracy of UniMorph Labeller is 98%, and that, in all language models studied (including ALBERT, BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa), alien tokenization leads to poorer generalizations compared to morphological tokenization for semantic compositionality of word meanings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13292v1,2024-04
Double Mixture: Towards Continual Event Detection from Speech,"Jingqi Kang, Tongtong Wu, Jinming Zhao, Guitao Wang, Yinwei Wei, Hao Yang, Guilin Qi, Yuan-Fang Li, Gholamreza Haffari","Speech event detection is crucial for multimedia retrieval, involving the tagging of both semantic and acoustic events. Traditional ASR systems often overlook the interplay between these events, focusing solely on content, even though the interpretation of dialogue can vary with environmental context. This paper tackles two primary challenges in speech event detection: the continual integration of new events without forgetting previous ones, and the disentanglement of semantic from acoustic events. We introduce a new task, continual event detection from speech, for which we also provide two benchmark datasets. To address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and effective disentanglement, we propose a novel method, 'Double Mixture.' This method merges speech expertise with robust memory mechanisms to enhance adaptability and prevent forgetting. Our comprehensive experiments show that this task presents significant challenges that are not effectively addressed by current state-of-the-art methods in either computer vision or natural language processing. Our approach achieves the lowest rates of forgetting and the highest levels of generalization, proving robust across various continual learning sequences.

Evaluation of Machine Translation Based on Semantic Dependencies and Keywords,"Kewei Yuan, Qiurong Zhao, Yang Xu, Xiao Zhang, Huansheng Ning","In view of the fact that most of the existing machine translation evaluation algorithms only consider the lexical and syntactic information, but ignore the deep semantic information contained in the sentence, this paper proposes a computational method for evaluating the semantic correctness of machine translations based on reference translations and incorporating semantic dependencies and sentence keyword information. Use the language technology platform developed by the Social Computing and Information Retrieval Research Center of Harbin Institute of Technology to conduct semantic dependency analysis and keyword analysis on sentences, and obtain semantic dependency graphs, keywords, and weight information corresponding to keywords. It includes all word information with semantic dependencies in the sentence and keyword information that affects semantic information. Construct semantic association pairs including word and dependency multi-features. The key semantics of the sentence cannot be highlighted in the semantic information extracted through semantic dependence, resulting in vague semantics analysis. Therefore, the sentence keyword information is also included in the scope of machine translation semantic evaluation. To achieve a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the semantic correctness of sentences, the experimental results show that the accuracy of the evaluation algorithm has been improved compared with similar methods, and it can more accurately measure the semantic correctness of machine translation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14443v1,2024-04
ISQA: Informative Factuality Feedback for Scientific Summarization,"Zekai Li, Yanxia Qin, Qian Liu, Min-Yen Kan","We propose Iterative Facuality Refining on Informative Scientific Question-Answering (ISQA) feedback\footnote{Code is available at \url{https://github.com/lizekai-richard/isqa}}, a method following human learning theories that employs model-generated feedback consisting of both positive and negative information. Through iterative refining of summaries, it probes for the underlying rationale of statements to enhance the factuality of scientific summarization. ISQA does this in a fine-grained manner by asking a summarization agent to reinforce validated statements in positive feedback and fix incorrect ones in negative feedback. Our findings demonstrate that the ISQA feedback mechanism significantly improves the factuality of various open-source LLMs on the summarization task, as evaluated across multiple scientific datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13246v1,2024-04
Personalized Wireless Federated Learning for Large Language Models,"Feibo Jiang, Li Dong, Siwei Tu, Yubo Peng, Kezhi Wang, Kun Yang, Cunhua Pan, Dusit Niyato","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their deployment in wireless networks still face challenges, i.e., a lack of privacy and security protection mechanisms. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to address these challenges. Yet, it suffers from issues including inefficient handling with big and heterogeneous data, resource-intensive training, and high communication overhead. To tackle these issues, we first compare different learning stages and their features of LLMs in wireless networks. Next, we introduce two personalized wireless federated fine-tuning methods with low communication overhead, i.e., (1) Personalized Federated Instruction Tuning (PFIT), which employs reinforcement learning to fine-tune local LLMs with diverse reward models to achieve personalization; (2) Personalized Federated Task Tuning (PFTT), which can leverage global adapters and local Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) to collaboratively fine-tune local LLMs, where the local LoRAs can be applied to achieve personalization without aggregation. Finally, we perform simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two methods and comprehensively discuss open issues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13238v1,2024-04
The Instruction Hierarchy: Training LLMs to Prioritize Privileged Instructions,"Eric Wallace, Kai Xiao, Reimar Leike, Lilian Weng, Johannes Heidecke, Alex Beutel","Today's LLMs are susceptible to prompt injections, jailbreaks, and other attacks that allow adversaries to overwrite a model's original instructions with their own malicious prompts. In this work, we argue that one of the primary vulnerabilities underlying these attacks is that LLMs often consider system prompts (e.g., text from an application developer) to be the same priority as text from untrusted users and third parties. To address this, we propose an instruction hierarchy that explicitly defines how models should behave when instructions of different priorities conflict. We then propose a data generation method to demonstrate this hierarchical instruction following behavior, which teaches LLMs to selectively ignore lower-privileged instructions. We apply this method to GPT-3.5, showing that it drastically increases robustness -- even for attack types not seen during training -- while imposing minimal degradations on standard capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13208v1,2024-04
Heterogeneous Subgraph Transformer for Fake News Detection,"Yuchen Zhang, Xiaoxiao Ma, Jia Wu, Jian Yang, Hao Fan","Fake news is pervasive on social media, inflicting substantial harm on public discourse and societal well-being. We investigate the explicit structural information and textual features of news pieces by constructing a heterogeneous graph concerning the relations among news topics, entities, and content. Through our study, we reveal that fake news can be effectively detected in terms of the atypical heterogeneous subgraphs centered on them, which encapsulate the essential semantics and intricate relations between news elements. However, suffering from the heterogeneity, exploring such heterogeneous subgraphs remains an open problem. To bridge the gap, this work proposes a heterogeneous subgraph transformer (HeteroSGT) to exploit subgraphs in our constructed heterogeneous graph. In HeteroSGT, we first employ a pre-trained language model to derive both word-level and sentence-level semantics. Then the random walk with restart (RWR) is applied to extract subgraphs centered on each news, which are further fed to our proposed subgraph Transformer to quantify the authenticity. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HeteroSGT over five baselines. Further case and ablation studies validate our motivation and demonstrate that performance improvement stems from our specially designed components.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13192v1,2024-04
Course-Skill Atlas: A national longitudinal dataset of skills taught in U.S. higher education curricula,"Alireza Javadian Sabet, Sarah H. Bana, Renzhe Yu, Morgan R. Frank","Higher education plays a critical role in driving an innovative economy by equipping students with knowledge and skills demanded by the workforce. While researchers and practitioners have developed data systems to track detailed occupational skills, such as those established by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), much less effort has been made to document which of these skills are being developed in higher education at a similar granularity. Here, we fill this gap by presenting Course-Skill Atlas -- a longitudinal dataset of skills inferred from over three million course syllabi taught at nearly three thousand U.S. higher education institutions. To construct Course-Skill Atlas, we apply natural language processing to quantify the alignment between course syllabi and detailed workplace activities (DWAs) used by the DOL to describe occupations. We then aggregate these alignment scores to create skill profiles for institutions and academic majors. Our dataset offers a large-scale representation of college education's role in preparing students for the labor market. Overall, Course-Skill Atlas can enable new research on the source of skills in the context of workforce development and provide actionable insights for shaping the future of higher education to meet evolving labor demands, especially in the face of new technologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13163v2,2024-04
Beyond Self-Consistency: Ensemble Reasoning Boosts Consistency and Accuracy of LLMs in Cancer Staging,"Chia-Hsuan Chang, Mary M. Lucas, Yeawon Lee, Christopher C. Yang, Grace Lu-Yao","Advances in large language models (LLMs) have encouraged their adoption in the healthcare domain where vital clinical information is often contained in unstructured notes. Cancer staging status is available in clinical reports, but it requires natural language processing to extract the status from the unstructured text. With the advance in clinical-oriented LLMs, it is promising to extract such status without extensive efforts in training the algorithms. Prompting approaches of the pre-trained LLMs that elicit a model's reasoning process, such as chain-of-thought, may help to improve the trustworthiness of the generated responses. Using self-consistency further improves model performance, but often results in inconsistent generations across the multiple reasoning paths. In this study, we propose an ensemble reasoning approach with the aim of improving the consistency of the model generations. Using an open access clinical large language model to determine the pathologic cancer stage from real-world pathology reports, we show that the ensemble reasoning approach is able to improve both the consistency and performance of the LLM in determining cancer stage, thereby demonstrating the potential to use these models in clinical or other domains where reliability and trustworthiness are critical.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13149v1,2024-04
Data Alignment for Zero-Shot Concept Generation in Dermatology AI,"Soham Gadgil, Mahtab Bigverdi","AI in dermatology is evolving at a rapid pace but the major limitation to training trustworthy classifiers is the scarcity of data with ground-truth concept level labels, which are meta-labels semantically meaningful to humans. Foundation models like CLIP providing zero-shot capabilities can help alleviate this challenge by leveraging vast amounts of image-caption pairs available on the internet. CLIP can be fine-tuned using domain specific image-caption pairs to improve classification performance. However, CLIP's pre-training data is not well-aligned with the medical jargon that clinicians use to perform diagnoses. The development of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has led to the possibility of leveraging the expressive nature of these models to generate rich text. Our goal is to use these models to generate caption text that aligns well with both the clinical lexicon and with the natural human language used in CLIP's pre-training data. Starting with captions used for images in PubMed articles, we extend them by passing the raw captions through an LLM fine-tuned on the field's several textbooks. We find that using captions generated by an expressive fine-tuned LLM like GPT-3.5 improves downstream zero-shot concept classification performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13043v2,2024-04
LaPA: Latent Prompt Assist Model For Medical Visual Question Answering,"Tiancheng Gu, Kaicheng Yang, Dongnan Liu, Weidong Cai","Medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) aims to automate the prediction of correct answers for medical images and questions, thereby assisting physicians in reducing repetitive tasks and alleviating their workload. Existing approaches primarily focus on pre-training models using additional and comprehensive datasets, followed by fine-tuning to enhance performance in downstream tasks. However, there is also significant value in exploring existing models to extract clinically relevant information. In this paper, we propose the Latent Prompt Assist model (LaPA) for medical visual question answering. Firstly, we design a latent prompt generation module to generate the latent prompt with the constraint of the target answer. Subsequently, we propose a multi-modal fusion block with latent prompt fusion module that utilizes the latent prompt to extract clinical-relevant information from uni-modal and multi-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a prior knowledge fusion module to integrate the relationship between diseases and organs with the clinical-relevant information. Finally, we combine the final integrated information with image-language cross-modal information to predict the final answers. Experimental results on three publicly available Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that LaPA outperforms the state-of-the-art model ARL, achieving improvements of 1.83%, 0.63%, and 1.80% on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and VQA-2019, respectively.

Sample Design Engineering: An Empirical Study of What Makes Good Downstream Fine-Tuning Samples for LLMs,"Biyang Guo, He Wang, Wenyilin Xiao, Hong Chen, Zhuxin Lee, Songqiao Han, Hailiang Huang","In the burgeoning field of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA, Prompt Engineering (PE) is renowned for boosting zero-shot or in-context learning (ICL) through prompt modifications. Yet, the realm of the sample design for downstream fine-tuning, crucial for task-specific LLM adaptation, is largely unexplored. This paper introduces Sample Design Engineering (SDE), a methodical approach to enhancing LLMs' post-tuning performance by refining input, output, and reasoning designs. We conduct a series of in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) experiments to assess the impact of various design options on LLMs' downstream performance, revealing several intriguing patterns that hold consistently across different LLMs. Based on these insights, we propose an integrated SDE strategy, combining the most effective options, and validate its consistent superiority over heuristic sample designs in complex downstream tasks like multi-aspect sentiment analysis, event extraction, and nested entity recognition. Additionally, analyses of LLMs' inherent prompt/output perplexity, zero-shot, and ICL abilities illustrate that good PE strategies may not always translate to good SDE strategies.

Stronger Random Baselines for In-Context Learning,"Gregory Yauney, David Mimno","Evaluating the in-context learning classification performance of language models poses challenges due to small dataset sizes, extensive prompt-selection using the validation set, and intentionally difficult tasks that lead to near-random performance. The standard random baseline--the expected accuracy of guessing labels uniformly at random--is stable when the evaluation set is used only once or when the dataset is large. We account for the common practice of validation set reuse and existing small datasets with a stronger random baseline: the expected maximum accuracy across multiple random classifiers. When choosing the best prompt demonstrations across six quantized language models applied to 16 BIG-bench Lite tasks, more than 20% of the few-shot results that exceed the standard baseline do not exceed this stronger random baseline. When held-out test sets are available, this stronger baseline is also a better predictor of held-out performance than the standard baseline, avoiding unnecessary test set evaluations. This maximum random baseline provides an easily calculated drop-in replacement for the standard baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13020v2,2024-04
Groma: Localized Visual Tokenization for Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models,"Chuofan Ma, Yi Jiang, Jiannan Wu, Zehuan Yuan, Xiaojuan Qi","We introduce Groma, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with grounded and fine-grained visual perception ability. Beyond holistic image understanding, Groma is adept at region-level tasks such as region captioning and visual grounding. Such capabilities are built upon a localized visual tokenization mechanism, where an image input is decomposed into regions of interest and subsequently encoded into region tokens. By integrating region tokens into user instructions and model responses, we seamlessly enable Groma to understand user-specified region inputs and ground its textual output to images. Besides, to enhance the grounded chat ability of Groma, we curate a visually grounded instruction dataset by leveraging the powerful GPT-4V and visual prompting techniques. Compared with MLLMs that rely on the language model or external module for localization, Groma consistently demonstrates superior performances in standard referring and grounding benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of embedding localization into image tokenization.

Rethinking the Evaluation of Dialogue Systems: Effects of User Feedback on Crowdworkers and LLMs,"Clemencia Siro, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Maarten de Rijke","In ad-hoc retrieval, evaluation relies heavily on user actions, including implicit feedback. In a conversational setting such signals are usually unavailable due to the nature of the interactions, and, instead, the evaluation often relies on crowdsourced evaluation labels. The role of user feedback in annotators' assessment of turns in a conversational perception has been little studied. We focus on how the evaluation of task-oriented dialogue systems (TDSs), is affected by considering user feedback, explicit or implicit, as provided through the follow-up utterance of a turn being evaluated. We explore and compare two methodologies for assessing TDSs: one includes the user's follow-up utterance and one without. We use both crowdworkers and large language models (LLMs) as annotators to assess system responses across four aspects: relevance, usefulness, interestingness, and explanation quality. Our findings indicate that there is a distinct difference in ratings assigned by both annotator groups in the two setups, indicating user feedback does influence system evaluation. Workers are more susceptible to user feedback on usefulness and interestingness compared to LLMs on interestingness and relevance. User feedback leads to a more personalized assessment of usefulness by workers, aligning closely with the user's explicit feedback. Additionally, in cases of ambiguous or complex user requests, user feedback improves agreement among crowdworkers. These findings emphasize the significance of user feedback in refining system evaluations and suggest the potential for automated feedback integration in future research. We publicly release the annotated data to foster research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12994v2,2024-04
Towards Reliable Latent Knowledge Estimation in LLMs: Zero-Prompt Many-Shot Based Factual Knowledge Extraction,"Qinyuan Wu, Mohammad Aflah Khan, Soumi Das, Vedant Nanda, Bishwamittra Ghosh, Camila Kolling, Till Speicher, Laurent Bindschaedler, Krishna P. Gummadi, Evimaria Terzi","In this paper, we focus on the challenging task of reliably estimating factual knowledge that is embedded inside large language models (LLMs). To avoid reliability concerns with prior approaches, we propose to eliminate prompt engineering when probing LLMs for factual knowledge. Our approach, called Zero-Prompt Latent Knowledge Estimator (ZP-LKE), leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to communicate both the factual knowledge question as well as the expected answer format. Our knowledge estimator is both conceptually simpler (i.e., doesn't depend on meta-linguistic judgments of LLMs) and easier to apply (i.e., is not LLM-specific), and we demonstrate that it can surface more of the latent knowledge embedded in LLMs. We also investigate how different design choices affect the performance of ZP-LKE. Using the proposed estimator, we perform a large-scale evaluation of the factual knowledge of a variety of open-source LLMs, like OPT, Pythia, Llama(2), Mistral, Gemma, etc. over a large set of relations and facts from the Wikidata knowledge base. We observe differences in the factual knowledge between different model families and models of different sizes, that some relations are consistently better known than others but that models differ in the precise facts they know, and differences in the knowledge of base models and their finetuned counterparts.

MAiDE-up: Multilingual Deception Detection of GPT-generated Hotel Reviews,"Oana Ignat, Xiaomeng Xu, Rada Mihalcea","Deceptive reviews are becoming increasingly common, especially given the increase in performance and the prevalence of LLMs. While work to date has addressed the development of models to differentiate between truthful and deceptive human reviews, much less is known about the distinction between real reviews and AI-authored fake reviews. Moreover, most of the research so far has focused primarily on English, with very little work dedicated to other languages. In this paper, we compile and make publicly available the MAiDE-up dataset, consisting of 10,000 real and 10,000 AI-generated fake hotel reviews, balanced across ten languages. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive linguistic analyses to (1) compare the AI fake hotel reviews to real hotel reviews, and (2) identify the factors that influence the deception detection model performance. We explore the effectiveness of several models for deception detection in hotel reviews across three main dimensions: sentiment, location, and language. We find that these dimensions influence how well we can detect AI-generated fake reviews.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12938v2,2024-04
Cross-cultural Inspiration Detection and Analysis in Real and LLM-generated Social Media Data,"Oana Ignat, Gayathri Ganesh Lakshmy, Rada Mihalcea","Inspiration is linked to various positive outcomes, such as increased creativity, productivity, and happiness. Although inspiration has great potential, there has been limited effort toward identifying content that is inspiring, as opposed to just engaging or positive. Additionally, most research has concentrated on Western data, with little attention paid to other cultures. This work is the first to study cross-cultural inspiration through machine learning methods. We aim to identify and analyze real and AI-generated cross-cultural inspiring posts. To this end, we compile and make publicly available the InspAIred dataset, which consists of 2,000 real inspiring posts, 2,000 real non-inspiring posts, and 2,000 generated inspiring posts evenly distributed across India and the UK. The real posts are sourced from Reddit, while the generated posts are created using the GPT-4 model.

Enabling Natural Zero-Shot Prompting on Encoder Models via Statement-Tuning,"Ahmed Elshabrawy, Yongxin Huang, Iryna Gurevych, Alham Fikri Aji","While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, they often require computationally prohibitive sizes. Conversely, smaller Masked Language Models (MLMs) like BERT and RoBERTa achieve state-of-the-art results through fine-tuning but struggle with extending to few-shot and zero-shot settings due to their architectural constraints. Hence, we propose Statement-Tuning, a technique that models discriminative tasks as a set of finite statements and trains an encoder model to discriminate between the potential statements to determine the label. We do Statement-Tuning on multiple tasks to enable cross-task generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that Statement-Tuning achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art LLMs with significantly fewer parameters. Moreover, the study investigates the impact of several design choices on few-shot and zero-shot generalization, revealing that Statement-Tuning can achieve strong performance with modest training data and benefits from task and statement diversity for unseen task generalizability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12897v3,2024-04
Unlocking Multi-View Insights in Knowledge-Dense Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Guanhua Chen, Wenhan Yu, Lei Sha","While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing retrieval methods in knowledge-dense domains like law and medicine still suffer from a lack of multi-perspective views, which are essential for improving interpretability and reliability. Previous research on multi-view retrieval often focused solely on different semantic forms of queries, neglecting the expression of specific domain knowledge perspectives. This paper introduces a novel multi-view RAG framework, MVRAG, tailored for knowledge-dense domains that utilizes intention-aware query rewriting from multiple domain viewpoints to enhance retrieval precision, thereby improving the effectiveness of the final inference. Experiments conducted on legal and medical case retrieval demonstrate significant improvements in recall and precision rates with our framework.

LLM-R2: A Large Language Model Enhanced Rule-based Rewrite System for Boosting Query Efficiency,"Zhaodonghui Li, Haitao Yuan, Huiming Wang, Gao Cong, Lidong Bing","Query rewrite, which aims to generate more efficient queries by altering a SQL query's structure without changing the query result, has been an important research problem. In order to maintain equivalence between the rewritten query and the original one during rewriting, traditional query rewrite methods always rewrite the queries following certain rewrite rules. However, some problems still remain. Firstly, existing methods of finding the optimal choice or sequence of rewrite rules are still limited and the process always costs a lot of resources. Methods involving discovering new rewrite rules typically require complicated proofs of structural logic or extensive user interactions. Secondly, current query rewrite methods usually rely highly on DBMS cost estimators which are often not accurate. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a novel method of query rewrite named LLM-R2, adopting a large language model (LLM) to propose possible rewrite rules for a database rewrite system. To further improve the inference ability of LLM in recommending rewrite rules, we train a contrastive model by curriculum to learn query representations and select effective query demonstrations for the LLM. Experimental results have shown that our method can significantly improve the query execution efficiency and outperform the baseline methods. In addition, our method enjoys high robustness across different datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12872v1,2024-04
How Does the Textual Information Affect the Retrieval of Multimodal In-Context Learning?,"Yang Luo, Zangwei Zheng, Zirui Zhu, Yang You","The increase in parameter size of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces significant capabilities, particularly in-context learning, where MLLMs enhance task performance without updating pre-trained parameters. This effectiveness, however, hinges on the appropriate selection of in-context examples, a process that is currently biased towards visual data, overlooking textual information. Furthermore, the area of supervised retrievers for MLLMs, crucial for optimal in-context example selection, continues to be uninvestigated. Our study offers an in-depth evaluation of the impact of textual information on the unsupervised selection of in-context examples in multimodal contexts, uncovering a notable sensitivity of retriever performance to the employed modalities. Responding to this, we introduce a novel supervised MLLM-retriever MSIER that employs a neural network to select examples that enhance multimodal in-context learning efficiency. This approach is validated through extensive testing across three distinct tasks, demonstrating the method's effectiveness. Additionally, we investigate the influence of modalities on our supervised retrieval method's training and pinpoint factors contributing to our model's success.

As per the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2023, over 280 million individuals are grappling with depression. This is a huge number; if not taken seriously, these numbers will increase rapidly. About 4.89 billion individuals are social media users. People express their feelings and emotions on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, etc. These platforms contain valuable information which can be used for research purposes. Considerable research has been conducted across various social media platforms. However, certain limitations persist in these endeavors. Particularly, previous studies were only focused on detecting depression and the intensity of depression in tweets. Also, there existed inaccuracies in dataset labeling. In this research work, five types of depression (Bipolar, major, psychotic, atypical, and postpartum) were predicted using tweets from the Twitter database based on lexicon labeling. Explainable AI was used to provide reasoning by highlighting the parts of tweets that represent type of depression. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was used for feature extraction and training. Machine learning and deep learning methodologies were used to train the model. The BERT model presented the most promising results, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.96.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13104v1,2024-04
TartuNLP @ SIGTYP 2024 Shared Task: Adapting XLM-RoBERTa for Ancient and Historical Languages,"Aleksei Dorkin, Kairit Sirts","We present our submission to the unconstrained subtask of the SIGTYP 2024 Shared Task on Word Embedding Evaluation for Ancient and Historical Languages for morphological annotation, POS-tagging, lemmatization, character- and word-level gap-filling. We developed a simple, uniform, and computationally lightweight approach based on the adapters framework using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We applied the same adapter-based approach uniformly to all tasks and 16 languages by fine-tuning stacked language- and task-specific adapters. Our submission obtained an overall second place out of three submissions, with the first place in word-level gap-filling. Our results show the feasibility of adapting language models pre-trained on modern languages to historical and ancient languages via adapter training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12845v2,2024-04
Towards Logically Consistent Language Models via Probabilistic Reasoning,"Diego Calanzone, Stefano Teso, Antonio Vergari","Large language models (LLMs) are a promising venue for natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, current LLMs are far from reliable: they are prone to generate non-factual information and, more crucially, to contradict themselves when prompted to reason about beliefs of the world. These problems are currently addressed with large scale fine-tuning or by delegating consistent reasoning to external tools. In this work, we strive for a middle ground and introduce a training objective based on principled probabilistic reasoning that teaches a LLM to be consistent with external knowledge in the form of a set of facts and rules. Fine-tuning with our loss on a limited set of facts enables our LLMs to be more logically consistent than previous baselines and allows them to extrapolate to unseen but semantically similar factual knowledge more systematically.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12843v1,2024-04
LiMe: a Latin Corpus of Late Medieval Criminal Sentences,"Alessandra Bassani, Beatrice Del Bo, Alfio Ferrara, Marta Mangini, Sergio Picascia, Ambra Stefanello","The Latin language has received attention from the computational linguistics research community, which has built, over the years, several valuable resources, ranging from detailed annotated corpora to sophisticated tools for linguistic analysis. With the recent advent of large language models, researchers have also started developing models capable of generating vector representations of Latin texts. The performances of such models remain behind the ones for modern languages, given the disparity in available data. In this paper, we present the LiMe dataset, a corpus of 325 documents extracted from a series of medieval manuscripts called Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani, and thoroughly annotated by experts, in order to be employed for masked language model, as well as supervised natural language processing tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12829v1,2024-04
CT-ADE: An Evaluation Benchmark for Adverse Drug Event Prediction from Clinical Trial Results,"Anthony Yazdani, Alban Bornet, Philipp Khlebnikov, Boya Zhang, Hossein Rouhizadeh, Poorya Amini, Douglas Teodoro","Adverse drug events (ADEs) significantly impact clinical research, causing many clinical trial failures. ADE prediction is key for developing safer medications and enhancing patient outcomes. To support this effort, we introduce CT-ADE, a dataset for multilabel predictive modeling of ADEs in monopharmacy treatments. CT-ADE integrates data from 2,497 unique drugs, encompassing 168,984 drug-ADE pairs extracted from clinical trials, annotated with patient and contextual information, and comprehensive ADE concepts standardized across multiple levels of the MedDRA ontology. Preliminary analyses with large language models (LLMs) achieved F1-scores up to 55.90%. Models using patient and contextual information showed F1-score improvements of 21%-38% over models using only chemical structure data. Our results highlight the importance of target population and treatment regimens in the predictive modeling of ADEs, offering greater performance gains than LLM domain specialization and scaling. CT-ADE provides an essential tool for researchers aiming to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance patient safety and minimize the impact of ADEs on pharmaceutical research and development.

REXEL: An End-to-end Model for Document-Level Relation Extraction and Entity Linking,"Nacime Bouziani, Shubhi Tyagi, Joseph Fisher, Jens Lehmann, Andrea Pierleoni","Extracting structured information from unstructured text is critical for many downstream NLP applications and is traditionally achieved by closed information extraction (cIE). However, existing approaches for cIE suffer from two limitations: (i) they are often pipelines which makes them prone to error propagation, and/or (ii) they are restricted to sentence level which prevents them from capturing long-range dependencies and results in expensive inference time. We address these limitations by proposing REXEL, a highly efficient and accurate model for the joint task of document level cIE (DocIE). REXEL performs mention detection, entity typing, entity disambiguation, coreference resolution and document-level relation classification in a single forward pass to yield facts fully linked to a reference knowledge graph. It is on average 11 times faster than competitive existing approaches in a similar setting and performs competitively both when optimised for any of the individual subtasks and a variety of combinations of different joint tasks, surpassing the baselines by an average of more than 6 F1 points. The combination of speed and accuracy makes REXEL an accurate cost-efficient system for extracting structured information at web-scale. We also release an extension of the DocRED dataset to enable benchmarking of future work on DocIE, which is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/e2e-docie.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12788v1,2024-04
AutoScraper: A Progressive Understanding Web Agent for Web Scraper Generation,"Wenhao Huang, Zhouhong Gu, Chenghao Peng, Zhixu Li, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Liqian Wen, Zulong Chen","Web scraping is a powerful technique that extracts data from websites, enabling automated data collection, enhancing data analysis capabilities, and minimizing manual data entry efforts. Existing methods, wrappers-based methods suffer from limited adaptability and scalability when faced with a new website, while language agents, empowered by large language models (LLMs), exhibit poor reusability in diverse web environments. In this work, we introduce the paradigm of generating web scrapers with LLMs and propose AutoScraper, a two-stage framework that can handle diverse and changing web environments more efficiently. AutoScraper leverages the hierarchical structure of HTML and similarity across different web pages for generating web scrapers. Besides, we propose a new executability metric for better measuring the performance of web scraper generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments with multiple LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Beyond Human Norms: Unveiling Unique Values of Large Language Models through Interdisciplinary Approaches,"Pablo Biedma, Xiaoyuan Yi, Linus Huang, Maosong Sun, Xing Xie","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the AI field but also pose potential safety and ethical risks. Deciphering LLMs' embedded values becomes crucial for assessing and mitigating their risks. Despite extensive investigation into LLMs' values, previous studies heavily rely on human-oriented value systems in social sciences. Then, a natural question arises: Do LLMs possess unique values beyond those of humans? Delving into it, this work proposes a novel framework, ValueLex, to reconstruct LLMs' unique value system from scratch, leveraging psychological methodologies from human personality/value research. Based on Lexical Hypothesis, ValueLex introduces a generative approach to elicit diverse values from 30+ LLMs, synthesizing a taxonomy that culminates in a comprehensive value framework via factor analysis and semantic clustering. We identify three core value dimensions, Competence, Character, and Integrity, each with specific subdimensions, revealing that LLMs possess a structured, albeit non-human, value system. Based on this system, we further develop tailored projective tests to evaluate and analyze the value inclinations of LLMs across different model sizes, training methods, and data sources. Our framework fosters an interdisciplinary paradigm of understanding LLMs, paving the way for future AI alignment and regulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12744v2,2024-04
Relevant or Random: Can LLMs Truly Perform Analogical Reasoning?,"Chengwei Qin, Wenhan Xia, Tan Wang, Fangkai Jiao, Yuchen Hu, Bosheng Ding, Ruirui Chen, Shafiq Joty","Analogical reasoning is a unique ability of humans to address unfamiliar challenges by transferring strategies from relevant past experiences. One key finding in psychology is that compared with irrelevant past experiences, recalling relevant ones can help humans better handle new tasks. Coincidentally, the NLP community has also recently found that self-generating relevant examples in the context can help large language models (LLMs) better solve a given problem than hand-crafted prompts. However, it is yet not clear whether relevance is the key factor eliciting such capability, i.e., can LLMs benefit more from self-generated relevant examples than irrelevant ones? In this work, we systematically explore whether LLMs can truly perform analogical reasoning on a diverse set of reasoning tasks. With extensive experiments and analysis, we show that self-generated random examples can surprisingly achieve comparable or even better performance, e.g., 4% performance boost on GSM8K with random biological examples. We find that the accuracy of self-generated examples is the key factor and subsequently design two improved methods with significantly reduced inference costs. Overall, we aim to advance a deeper understanding of LLM analogical reasoning and hope this work stimulates further research in the design of self-generated contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12728v2,2024-04
Evaluating Character Understanding of Large Language Models via Character Profiling from Fictional Works,"Xinfeng Yuan, Siyu Yuan, Yuhan Cui, Tianhe Lin, Xintao Wang, Rui Xu, Jiangjie Chen, Deqing Yang","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance and spurred numerous AI applications, in which role-playing agents (RPAs) are particularly popular, especially for fictional characters. The prerequisite for these RPAs lies in the capability of LLMs to understand characters from fictional works. Previous efforts have evaluated this capability via basic classification tasks or characteristic imitation, failing to capture the nuanced character understanding with LLMs. In this paper, we propose evaluating LLMs' character understanding capability via the character profiling task, i.e., summarizing character profiles from corresponding materials, a widely adopted yet understudied practice for RPA development. Specifically, we construct the CroSS dataset from literature experts and assess the generated profiles by comparing them with ground truth references and evaluating their applicability in downstream tasks. Our experiments, which cover various summarization methods and LLMs, have yielded promising results. These results strongly validate the character understanding capability of LLMs. Resources are available at https://github.com/Joanna0123/character_profiling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12726v3,2024-04
PDF-MVQA: A Dataset for Multimodal Information Retrieval in PDF-based Visual Question Answering,"Yihao Ding, Kaixuan Ren, Jiabin Huang, Siwen Luo, Soyeon Caren Han","Document Question Answering (QA) presents a challenge in understanding visually-rich documents (VRD), particularly those dominated by lengthy textual content like research journal articles. Existing studies primarily focus on real-world documents with sparse text, while challenges persist in comprehending the hierarchical semantic relations among multiple pages to locate multimodal components. To address this gap, we propose PDF-MVQA, which is tailored for research journal articles, encompassing multiple pages and multimodal information retrieval. Unlike traditional machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks, our approach aims to retrieve entire paragraphs containing answers or visually rich document entities like tables and figures. Our contributions include the introduction of a comprehensive PDF Document VQA dataset, allowing the examination of semantically hierarchical layout structures in text-dominant documents. We also present new VRD-QA frameworks designed to grasp textual contents and relations among document layouts simultaneously, extending page-level understanding to the entire multi-page document.

Ensemble Learning for Heterogeneous Large Language Models with Deep Parallel Collaboration,"Yichong Huang, Xiaocheng Feng, Baohang Li, Yang Xiang, Hui Wang, Bing Qin, Ting Liu","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths in various tasks, motivating the research of LLM ensembling. However, existing work focuses on training an extra reward model or fusion model to select or combine all candidate answers, posing a great challenge to the generalization on unseen data distributions. Besides, prior methods use textual responses as communication media, ignoring the valuable information in the internal representations. In this work, we propose a training-free ensemble framework DeePEn, fusing the informative probability distributions yielded by different LLMs at each decoding step. Unfortunately, the vocabulary discrepancy between heterogeneous LLMs directly makes averaging the distributions unfeasible due to the token misalignment. To address this challenge, DeePEn maps the probability distribution of each model from its own probability space to a universal relative space based on the relative representation theory, and performs aggregation. Next, we devise a search-based inverse transformation to transform the aggregated result back to the probability space of one of the ensembling LLMs (main model), in order to determine the next token. We conduct extensive experiments on ensembles of different number of LLMs, ensembles of LLMs with different architectures, and ensembles between the LLM and the specialist model. Experimental results show that (i) DeePEn achieves consistent improvements across six benchmarks covering subject examination, reasoning, and knowledge, (ii) a well-performing specialist model can benefit from a less effective LLM through distribution fusion, and (iii) DeePEn has complementary strengths with other ensemble methods such as voting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12715v2,2024-04
Mathify: Evaluating Large Language Models on Mathematical Problem Solving Tasks,"Avinash Anand, Mohit Gupta, Kritarth Prasad, Navya Singla, Sanjana Sanjeev, Jatin Kumar, Adarsh Raj Shivam, Rajiv Ratn Shah","The rapid progress in the field of natural language processing (NLP) systems and the expansion of large language models (LLMs) have opened up numerous opportunities in the field of education and instructional methods. These advancements offer the potential for tailored learning experiences and immediate feedback, all delivered through accessible and cost-effective services. One notable application area for this technological advancement is in the realm of solving mathematical problems. Mathematical problem-solving not only requires the ability to decipher complex problem statements but also the skill to perform precise arithmetic calculations at each step of the problem-solving process. However, the evaluation of the arithmetic capabilities of large language models remains an area that has received relatively little attention. In response, we introduce an extensive mathematics dataset called ""MathQuest"" sourced from the 11th and 12th standard Mathematics NCERT textbooks. This dataset encompasses mathematical challenges of varying complexity and covers a wide range of mathematical concepts. Utilizing this dataset, we conduct fine-tuning experiments with three prominent LLMs: LLaMA-2, WizardMath, and MAmmoTH. These fine-tuned models serve as benchmarks for evaluating their performance on our dataset. Our experiments reveal that among the three models, MAmmoTH-13B emerges as the most proficient, achieving the highest level of competence in solving the presented mathematical problems. Consequently, MAmmoTH-13B establishes itself as a robust and dependable benchmark for addressing NCERT mathematics problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13099v1,2024-04
Neural Semantic Parsing with Extremely Rich Symbolic Meaning Representations,"Xiao Zhang, Gosse Bouma, Johan Bos","Current open-domain neural semantics parsers show impressive performance. However, closer inspection of the symbolic meaning representations they produce reveals significant weaknesses: sometimes they tend to merely copy character sequences from the source text to form symbolic concepts, defaulting to the most frequent word sense based in the training distribution. By leveraging the hierarchical structure of a lexical ontology, we introduce a novel compositional symbolic representation for concepts based on their position in the taxonomical hierarchy. This representation provides richer semantic information and enhances interpretability. We introduce a neural ""taxonomical"" semantic parser to utilize this new representation system of predicates, and compare it with a standard neural semantic parser trained on the traditional meaning representation format, employing a novel challenge set and evaluation metric for evaluation. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the taxonomical model, trained on much richer and complex meaning representations, is slightly subordinate in performance to the traditional model using the standard metrics for evaluation, but outperforms it when dealing with out-of-vocabulary concepts. This finding is encouraging for research in computational semantics that aims to combine data-driven distributional meanings with knowledge-based symbolic representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12698v2,2024-04
Towards Human-centered Proactive Conversational Agents,"Yang Deng, Lizi Liao, Zhonghua Zheng, Grace Hui Yang, Tat-Seng Chua","Recent research on proactive conversational agents (PCAs) mainly focuses on improving the system's capabilities in anticipating and planning action sequences to accomplish tasks and achieve goals before users articulate their requests. This perspectives paper highlights the importance of moving towards building human-centered PCAs that emphasize human needs and expectations, and that considers ethical and social implications of these agents, rather than solely focusing on technological capabilities. The distinction between a proactive and a reactive system lies in the proactive system's initiative-taking nature. Without thoughtful design, proactive systems risk being perceived as intrusive by human users. We address the issue by establishing a new taxonomy concerning three key dimensions of human-centered PCAs, namely Intelligence, Adaptivity, and Civility. We discuss potential research opportunities and challenges based on this new taxonomy upon the five stages of PCA system construction. This perspectives paper lays a foundation for the emerging area of conversational information retrieval research and paves the way towards advancing human-centered proactive conversational systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12670v1,2024-04
SOS-1K: A Fine-grained Suicide Risk Classification Dataset for Chinese Social Media Analysis,"Hongzhi Qi, Hanfei Liu, Jianqiang Li, Qing Zhao, Wei Zhai, Dan Luo, Tian Yu He, Shuo Liu, Bing Xiang Yang, Guanghui Fu","In the social media, users frequently express personal emotions, a subset of which may indicate potential suicidal tendencies. The implicit and varied forms of expression in internet language complicate accurate and rapid identification of suicidal intent on social media, thus creating challenges for timely intervention efforts. The development of deep learning models for suicide risk detection is a promising solution, but there is a notable lack of relevant datasets, especially in the Chinese context. To address this gap, this study presents a Chinese social media dataset designed for fine-grained suicide risk classification, focusing on indicators such as expressions of suicide intent, methods of suicide, and urgency of timing. Seven pre-trained models were evaluated in two tasks: high and low suicide risk, and fine-grained suicide risk classification on a level of 0 to 10. In our experiments, deep learning models show good performance in distinguishing between high and low suicide risk, with the best model achieving an F1 score of 88.39%. However, the results for fine-grained suicide risk classification were still unsatisfactory, with an weighted F1 score of 50.89%. To address the issues of data imbalance and limited dataset size, we investigated both traditional and advanced, large language model based data augmentation techniques, demonstrating that data augmentation can enhance model performance by up to 4.65% points in F1-score. Notably, the Chinese MentalBERT model, which was pre-trained on psychological domain data, shows superior performance in both tasks. This study provides valuable insights for automatic identification of suicidal individuals, facilitating timely psychological intervention on social media platforms. The source code and data are publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12659v1,2024-04
Pre-trained Vision-Language Models Learn Discoverable Visual Concepts,"Yuan Zang, Tian Yun, Hao Tan, Trung Bui, Chen Sun","Do vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained to caption an image of a ""durian"" learn visual concepts such as ""brown"" (color) and ""spiky"" (texture) at the same time? We aim to answer this question as visual concepts learned ""for free"" would enable wide applications such as neuro-symbolic reasoning or human-interpretable object classification. We assume that the visual concepts, if captured by pre-trained VLMs, can be extracted by their vision-language interface with text-based concept prompts. We observe that recent works prompting VLMs with concepts often differ in their strategies to define and evaluate the visual concepts, leading to conflicting conclusions. We propose a new concept definition strategy based on two observations: First, certain concept prompts include shortcuts that recognize correct concepts for wrong reasons; Second, multimodal information (e.g. visual discriminativeness, and textual knowledge) should be leveraged when selecting the concepts. Our proposed concept discovery and learning (CDL) framework is thus designed to identify a diverse list of generic visual concepts (e.g. ""spiky"" as opposed to ""spiky durian""), which are ranked and selected based on visual and language mutual information. We carefully design quantitative and human evaluations of the discovered concepts on six diverse visual recognition datasets, which confirm that pre-trained VLMs do learn visual concepts that provide accurate and thorough descriptions for the recognized objects. All code and models are publicly released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12652v1,2024-04
Cooperative Sentiment Agents for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Shanmin Wang, Hui Shuai, Qingshan Liu, Fei Wang","In this paper, we propose a new Multimodal Representation Learning (MRL) method for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), which facilitates the adaptive interaction between modalities through Cooperative Sentiment Agents, named Co-SA. Co-SA comprises two critical components: the Sentiment Agents Establishment (SAE) phase and the Sentiment Agents Cooperation (SAC) phase. During the SAE phase, each sentiment agent deals with an unimodal signal and highlights explicit dynamic sentiment variations within the modality via the Modality-Sentiment Disentanglement (MSD) and Deep Phase Space Reconstruction (DPSR) modules. Subsequently, in the SAC phase, Co-SA meticulously designs task-specific interaction mechanisms for sentiment agents so that coordinating multimodal signals to learn the joint representation. Specifically, Co-SA equips an independent policy model for each sentiment agent that captures significant properties within the modality. These policies are optimized mutually through the unified reward adaptive to downstream tasks. Benefitting from the rewarding mechanism, Co-SA transcends the limitation of pre-defined fusion modes and adaptively captures unimodal properties for MRL in the multimodal interaction setting. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Co-SA, we apply it to address Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) and Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) tasks. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that Co-SA excels at discovering diverse cross-modal features, encompassing both common and complementary aspects. The code can be available at https://github.com/smwanghhh/Co-SA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12642v1,2024-04
Efficient infusion of self-supervised representations in Automatic Speech Recognition,"Darshan Prabhu, Sai Ganesh Mirishkar, Pankaj Wasnik","Self-supervised learned (SSL) models such as Wav2vec and HuBERT yield state-of-the-art results on speech-related tasks. Given the effectiveness of such models, it is advantageous to use them in conventional ASR systems. While some approaches suggest incorporating these models as a trainable encoder or a learnable frontend, training such systems is extremely slow and requires a lot of computation cycles. In this work, we propose two simple approaches that use (1) framewise addition and (2) cross-attention mechanisms to efficiently incorporate the representations from the SSL model(s) into the ASR architecture, resulting in models that are comparable in size with standard encoder-decoder conformer systems while also avoiding the usage of SSL models during training. Our approach results in faster training and yields significant performance gains on the Librispeech and Tedlium datasets compared to baselines. We further provide detailed analysis and ablation studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12628v1,2024-04
CORI: CJKV Benchmark with Romanization Integration -- A step towards Cross-lingual Transfer Beyond Textual Scripts,"Hoang H. Nguyen, Chenwei Zhang, Ye Liu, Natalie Parde, Eugene Rohrbaugh, Philip S. Yu","Naively assuming English as a source language may hinder cross-lingual transfer for many languages by failing to consider the importance of language contact. Some languages are more well-connected than others, and target languages can benefit from transferring from closely related languages; for many languages, the set of closely related languages does not include English. In this work, we study the impact of source language for cross-lingual transfer, demonstrating the importance of selecting source languages that have high contact with the target language. We also construct a novel benchmark dataset for close contact Chinese-Japanese-Korean-Vietnamese (CJKV) languages to further encourage in-depth studies of language contact. To comprehensively capture contact between these languages, we propose to integrate Romanized transcription beyond textual scripts via Contrastive Learning objectives, leading to enhanced cross-lingual representations and effective zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12618v1,2024-04
Auto-Formula: Recommend Formulas in Spreadsheets using Contrastive Learning for Table Representations,"Sibei Chen, Yeye He, Weiwei Cui, Ju Fan, Song Ge, Haidong Zhang, Dongmei Zhang, Surajit Chaudhuri","Spreadsheets are widely recognized as the most popular end-user programming tools, which blend the power of formula-based computation, with an intuitive table-based interface. Today, spreadsheets are used by billions of users to manipulate tables, most of whom are neither database experts nor professional programmers.   Despite the success of spreadsheets, authoring complex formulas remains challenging, as non-technical users need to look up and understand non-trivial formula syntax. To address this pain point, we leverage the observation that there is often an abundance of similar-looking spreadsheets in the same organization, which not only have similar data, but also share similar computation logic encoded as formulas. We develop an Auto-Formula system that can accurately predict formulas that users want to author in a target spreadsheet cell, by learning and adapting formulas that already exist in similar spreadsheets, using contrastive-learning techniques inspired by ""similar-face recognition"" from compute vision.   Extensive evaluations on over 2K test formulas extracted from real enterprise spreadsheets show the effectiveness of Auto-Formula over alternatives.

Parameter Efficient Diverse Paraphrase Generation Using Sequence-Level Knowledge Distillation,"Lasal Jayawardena, Prasan Yapa","Over the past year, the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has experienced an exponential surge, largely due to the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models have exhibited the most effective performance in a range of domains within the Natural Language Processing and Generation domains. However, their application in domain-specific tasks, such as paraphrasing, presents significant challenges. The extensive number of parameters makes them difficult to operate on commercial hardware, and they require substantial time for inference, leading to high costs in a production setting. In this study, we tackle these obstacles by employing LLMs to develop three distinct models for the paraphrasing field, applying a method referred to as sequence-level knowledge distillation. These distilled models are capable of maintaining the quality of paraphrases generated by the LLM. They demonstrate faster inference times and the ability to generate diverse paraphrases of comparable quality. A notable characteristic of these models is their ability to exhibit syntactic diversity while also preserving lexical diversity, features previously uncommon due to existing data quality issues in datasets and not typically observed in neural-based approaches. Human evaluation of our models shows that there is only a 4% drop in performance compared to the LLM teacher model used in the distillation process, despite being 1000 times smaller. This research provides a significant contribution to the NLG field, offering a more efficient and cost-effective solution for paraphrasing tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12596v1,2024-04
iTBLS: A Dataset of Interactive Conversations Over Tabular Information,"Anirudh Sundar, Christopher Richardson, William Gay, Larry Heck","This paper introduces Interactive Tables (iTBLS), a dataset of interactive conversations situated in tables from scientific articles. This dataset is designed to facilitate human-AI collaborative problem-solving through AI-powered multi-task tabular capabilities. In contrast to prior work that models interactions as factoid QA or procedure synthesis, iTBLS broadens the scope of interactions to include mathematical reasoning, natural language manipulation, and expansion of existing tables from natural language conversation by delineating interactions into one of three tasks: interpretation, modification, or generation. Additionally, the paper presents a suite of baseline approaches to iTBLS, utilizing zero-shot prompting and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for different computing situations. We also introduce a novel multi-step approach and show how it can be leveraged in conjunction with parameter-efficient fine-tuning to achieve the state-of-the-art on iTBLS; outperforming standard parameter-efficient fine-tuning by up to 15% on interpretation, 18% on modification, and 38% on generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12580v1,2024-04
Dubo-SQL: Diverse Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Fine Tuning for Text-to-SQL,"Dayton G. Thorpe, Andrew J. Duberstein, Ian A. Kinsey","The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) for automated text-to-SQL still falls well short of expert human performance as measured by execution accuracy (EX) on the BIRD-SQL benchmark. The most accurate methods are also slow and expensive. To advance the SOTA for text-to-SQL while reducing cost and improving speed, we explore the combination of low-cost fine tuning, novel methods for diverse retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and new input and output formats that help large language models (LLMs) achieve higher EX. We introduce two new methods, Dubo-SQL v1 and v2. Dubo-SQL v1 sets a new record for EX on the holdout test set of BIRD-SQL. Dubo-SQL v2 achieves even higher performance on the BIRD-SQL dev set. Dubo-SQL v1 relies on LLMs from OpenAI, but uses the low-cost GPT-3.5 Turbo while exceeding the performance of the next-best model using OpenAI, which instead uses the more expensive GPT-4. Dubo-SQL v1 exceeds the performance of the next-best model using GPT-3.5 by over 20%. Dubo-SQL v2 uses GPT-4 Turbo and RAG in place of fine tuning to push EX higher.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12560v1,2024-04
Latent Concept-based Explanation of NLP Models,"Xuemin Yu, Fahim Dalvi, Nadir Durrani, Marzia Nouri, Hassan Sajjad","Interpreting and understanding the predictions made by deep learning models poses a formidable challenge due to their inherently opaque nature. Many previous efforts aimed at explaining these predictions rely on input features, specifically, the words within NLP models. However, such explanations are often less informative due to the discrete nature of these words and their lack of contextual verbosity. To address this limitation, we introduce the Latent Concept Attribution method (LACOAT), which generates explanations for predictions based on latent concepts. Our foundational intuition is that a word can exhibit multiple facets, contingent upon the context in which it is used. Therefore, given a word in context, the latent space derived from our training process reflects a specific facet of that word. LACOAT functions by mapping the representations of salient input words into the training latent space, allowing it to provide latent context-based explanations of the prediction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12545v3,2024-04
"Is There No Such Thing as a Bad Question? H4R: HalluciBot For Ratiocination, Rewriting, Ranking, and Routing","William Watson, Nicole Cho, Nishan Srishankar","Hallucination continues to be one of the most critical challenges in the institutional adoption journey of Large Language Models (LLMs). While prior studies have primarily focused on the post-generation analysis and refinement of outputs, this paper centers on the effectiveness of queries in eliciting accurate responses from LLMs. We present HalluciBot, a model that estimates the query's propensity to hallucinate before generation, without invoking any LLMs during inference. HalluciBot can serve as a proxy reward model for query rewriting, offering a general framework to estimate query quality based on accuracy and consensus. In essence, HalluciBot investigates how poorly constructed queries can lead to erroneous outputs - moreover, by employing query rewriting guided by HalluciBot's empirical estimates, we demonstrate that 95.7% output accuracy can be achieved for Multiple Choice questions. The training procedure for HalluciBot consists of perturbing 369,837 queries n times, employing n+1 independent LLM agents, sampling an output from each query, conducting a Multi-Agent Monte Carlo simulation on the sampled outputs, and training an encoder classifier. The idea of perturbation is the outcome of our ablation studies that measures the increase in output diversity (+12.5 agreement spread) by perturbing a query in lexically different but semantically similar ways. Therefore, HalluciBot paves the way to ratiocinate (76.0% test F1 score, 46.6% in saved computation on hallucinatory queries), rewrite (+30.2% positive class transition from hallucinatory to non-hallucinatory), rank (+50.6% positive class transition from hallucinatory to non-hallucinatory), and route queries to effective pipelines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12535v3,2024-04
Adaptive Memory Replay for Continual Learning,"James Seale Smith, Lazar Valkov, Shaunak Halbe, Vyshnavi Gutta, Rogerio Feris, Zsolt Kira, Leonid Karlinsky","Foundation Models (FMs) have become the hallmark of modern AI, however, these models are trained on massive data, leading to financially expensive training. Updating FMs as new data becomes available is important, however, can lead to `catastrophic forgetting', where models underperform on tasks related to data sub-populations observed too long ago. This continual learning (CL) phenomenon has been extensively studied, but primarily in a setting where only a small amount of past data can be stored. We advocate for the paradigm where memory is abundant, allowing us to keep all previous data, but computational resources are limited. In this setting, traditional replay-based CL approaches are outperformed by a simple baseline which replays past data selected uniformly at random, indicating that this setting necessitates a new approach. We address this by introducing a framework of adaptive memory replay for continual learning, where sampling of past data is phrased as a multi-armed bandit problem. We utilize Bolzmann sampling to derive a method which dynamically selects past data for training conditioned on the current task, assuming full data access and emphasizing training efficiency. Through extensive evaluations on both vision and language pre-training tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which maintains high performance while reducing forgetting by up to 10% at no training efficiency cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12526v1,2024-04
UIClip: A Data-driven Model for Assessing User Interface Design,"Jason Wu, Yi-Hao Peng, Amanda Li, Amanda Swearngin, Jeffrey P. Bigham, Jeffrey Nichols","User interface (UI) design is a difficult yet important task for ensuring the usability, accessibility, and aesthetic qualities of applications. In our paper, we develop a machine-learned model, UIClip, for assessing the design quality and visual relevance of a UI given its screenshot and natural language description. To train UIClip, we used a combination of automated crawling, synthetic augmentation, and human ratings to construct a large-scale dataset of UIs, collated by description and ranked by design quality. Through training on the dataset, UIClip implicitly learns properties of good and bad designs by i) assigning a numerical score that represents a UI design's relevance and quality and ii) providing design suggestions. In an evaluation that compared the outputs of UIClip and other baselines to UIs rated by 12 human designers, we found that UIClip achieved the highest agreement with ground-truth rankings. Finally, we present three example applications that demonstrate how UIClip can facilitate downstream applications that rely on instantaneous assessment of UI design quality: i) UI code generation, ii) UI design tips generation, and iii) quality-aware UI example search.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12500v1,2024-04
BIRD: A Trustworthy Bayesian Inference Framework for Large Language Models,"Yu Feng, Ben Zhou, Weidong Lin, Dan Roth","Predictive models often need to work with incomplete information in real-world tasks. Consequently, they must provide reliable probability or confidence estimation, especially in large-scale decision making and planning tasks. Current large language models (LLM) are insufficient for such accurate estimations, but they can generate relevant factors that may affect the probabilities, produce coarse-grained probabilities when the information is more complete, and help determine which factors are relevant to specific downstream contexts. In this paper, we make use of these capabilities of LLMs to provide a significantly more accurate probabilistic estimation. We propose BIRD, a novel probabilistic inference framework that aligns a Bayesian network with LLM abductions and then estimates more accurate probabilities in a deduction step. We show BIRD provides reliable probability estimations that are 30\% better than those provided directly by LLM baselines. These estimates can further contribute to better and more trustworthy decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12494v2,2024-04
EnriCo: Enriched Representation and Globally Constrained Inference for Entity and Relation Extraction,"Urchade Zaratiana, Nadi Tomeh, Yann Dauxais, Pierre Holat, Thierry Charnois","Joint entity and relation extraction plays a pivotal role in various applications, notably in the construction of knowledge graphs. Despite recent progress, existing approaches often fall short in two key aspects: richness of representation and coherence in output structure. These models often rely on handcrafted heuristics for computing entity and relation representations, potentially leading to loss of crucial information. Furthermore, they disregard task and/or dataset-specific constraints, resulting in output structures that lack coherence. In our work, we introduce EnriCo, which mitigates these shortcomings. Firstly, to foster rich and expressive representation, our model leverage attention mechanisms that allow both entities and relations to dynamically determine the pertinent information required for accurate extraction. Secondly, we introduce a series of decoding algorithms designed to infer the highest scoring solutions while adhering to task and dataset-specific constraints, thus promoting structured and coherent outputs. Our model demonstrates competitive performance compared to baselines when evaluated on Joint IE datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12493v1,2024-04
GraphER: A Structure-aware Text-to-Graph Model for Entity and Relation Extraction,"Urchade Zaratiana, Nadi Tomeh, Niama El Khbir, Pierre Holat, Thierry Charnois","Information extraction (IE) is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involving the extraction of named entities and their relationships from unstructured text. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to this task by formulating it as graph structure learning (GSL). By formulating IE as GSL, we enhance the model's ability to dynamically refine and optimize the graph structure during the extraction process. This formulation allows for better interaction and structure-informed decisions for entity and relation prediction, in contrast to previous models that have separate or untied predictions for these tasks. When compared against state-of-the-art baselines on joint entity and relation extraction benchmarks, our model, GraphER, achieves competitive results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12491v1,2024-04
Grammatical Error Correction for Code-Switched Sentences by Learners of English,"Kelvin Wey Han Chan, Christopher Bryant, Li Nguyen, Andrew Caines, Zheng Yuan","Code-switching (CSW) is a common phenomenon among multilingual speakers where multiple languages are used in a single discourse or utterance. Mixed language utterances may still contain grammatical errors however, yet most existing Grammar Error Correction (GEC) systems have been trained on monolingual data and not developed with CSW in mind. In this work, we conduct the first exploration into the use of GEC systems on CSW text. Through this exploration, we propose a novel method of generating synthetic CSW GEC datasets by translating different spans of text within existing GEC corpora. We then investigate different methods of selecting these spans based on CSW ratio, switch-point factor and linguistic constraints, and identify how they affect the performance of GEC systems on CSW text. Our best model achieves an average increase of 1.57 $F_{0.5}$ across 3 CSW test sets (English-Chinese, English-Korean and English-Japanese) without affecting the model's performance on a monolingual dataset. We furthermore discovered that models trained on one CSW language generalise relatively well to other typologically similar CSW languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12489v2,2024-04
Monitoring Critical Infrastructure Facilities During Disasters Using Large Language Models,"Abdul Wahab Ziaullah, Ferda Ofli, Muhammad Imran","Critical Infrastructure Facilities (CIFs), such as healthcare and transportation facilities, are vital for the functioning of a community, especially during large-scale emergencies. In this paper, we explore a potential application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to monitor the status of CIFs affected by natural disasters through information disseminated in social media networks. To this end, we analyze social media data from two disaster events in two different countries to identify reported impacts to CIFs as well as their impact severity and operational status. We employ state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to perform computational tasks including retrieval, classification, and inference, all in a zero-shot setting. Through extensive experimentation, we report the results of these tasks using standard evaluation metrics and reveal insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs. We note that although LLMs perform well in classification tasks, they encounter challenges with inference tasks, especially when the context/prompt is complex and lengthy. Additionally, we outline various potential directions for future exploration that can be beneficial during the initial adoption phase of LLMs for disaster response tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14432v1,2024-04
NormAd: A Framework for Measuring the Cultural Adaptability of Large Language Models,"Abhinav Rao, Akhila Yerukola, Vishwa Shah, Katharina Reinecke, Maarten Sap","To be effectively and safely deployed to global user populations, large language models (LLMs) must adapt outputs to user values and culture, not just know about them. We introduce NormAd, an evaluation framework to assess LLMs' cultural adaptability, specifically measuring their ability to judge social acceptability across different levels of cultural norm specificity, from abstract values to explicit social norms. As an instantiation of our framework, we create NormAd-Eti, a benchmark of 2.6k situational descriptions representing social-etiquette related cultural norms from 75 countries. Through comprehensive experiments on NormAd-Eti, we find that LLMs struggle to accurately judge social acceptability across these varying degrees of cultural contexts and show stronger adaptability to English-centric cultures over those from the Global South. Even in the simplest setting where the relevant social norms are provided, our best models' performance (<82%) lags behind humans (>95%). In settings with abstract values and country information, model performance drops substantially (<60%), while human accuracy remains high (>90%). Furthermore, we find that models are better at recognizing socially acceptable versus unacceptable situations. Our findings showcase the current pitfalls in socio-cultural reasoning of LLMs which hinder their adaptability for global audiences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12464v7,2024-04
RAGCache: Efficient Knowledge Caching for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Chao Jin, Zili Zhang, Xuanlin Jiang, Fangyue Liu, Xin Liu, Xuanzhe Liu, Xin Jin","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks by integrating the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and external knowledge databases. However, RAG introduces long sequence generation and leads to high computation and memory costs. We propose RAGCache, a novel multilevel dynamic caching system tailored for RAG. Our analysis benchmarks current RAG systems, pinpointing the performance bottleneck (i.e., long sequence due to knowledge injection) and optimization opportunities (i.e., caching knowledge's intermediate states). Based on these insights, we design RAGCache, which organizes the intermediate states of retrieved knowledge in a knowledge tree and caches them in the GPU and host memory hierarchy. RAGCache proposes a replacement policy that is aware of LLM inference characteristics and RAG retrieval patterns. It also dynamically overlaps the retrieval and inference steps to minimize the end-to-end latency. We implement RAGCache and evaluate it on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference system and Faiss, a state-of-the-art vector database. The experimental results show that RAGCache reduces the time to first token (TTFT) by up to 4x and improves the throughput by up to 2.1x compared to vLLM integrated with Faiss.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12457v2,2024-04
Characterizing LLM Abstention Behavior in Science QA with Context Perturbations,"Bingbing Wen, Bill Howe, Lucy Lu Wang","The correct model response in the face of uncertainty is to abstain from answering a question so as not to mislead the user. In this work, we study the ability of LLMs to abstain from answering context-dependent science questions when provided insufficient or incorrect context. We probe model sensitivity in several settings: removing gold context, replacing gold context with irrelevant context, and providing additional context beyond what is given. In experiments on four QA datasets with six LLMs, we show that performance varies greatly across models, across the type of context provided, and also by question type; in particular, many LLMs seem unable to abstain from answering boolean questions using standard QA prompts. Our analysis also highlights the unexpected impact of abstention performance on QA task accuracy. Counter-intuitively, in some settings, replacing gold context with irrelevant context or adding irrelevant context to gold context can improve abstention performance in a way that results in improvements in task performance. Our results imply that changes are needed in QA dataset design and evaluation to more effectively assess the correctness and downstream impacts of model abstention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12452v2,2024-04
AmbigDocs: Reasoning across Documents on Different Entities under the Same Name,"Yoonsang Lee, Xi Ye, Eunsol Choi","Different entities with the same name can be difficult to distinguish. Handling confusing entity mentions is a crucial skill for language models (LMs). For example, given the question ""Where was Michael Jordan educated?"" and a set of documents discussing different people named Michael Jordan, can LMs distinguish entity mentions to generate a cohesive answer to the question? To test this ability, we introduce a new benchmark, AmbigDocs. By leveraging Wikipedia's disambiguation pages, we identify a set of documents, belonging to different entities who share an ambiguous name. From these documents, we generate questions containing an ambiguous name and their corresponding sets of answers. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art models often yield ambiguous answers or incorrectly merge information belonging to different entities. We establish an ontology categorizing four types of incomplete answers and automatic evaluation metrics to identify such categories. We lay the foundation for future work on reasoning across multiple documents with ambiguous entities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12447v3,2024-04
mOthello: When Do Cross-Lingual Representation Alignment and Cross-Lingual Transfer Emerge in Multilingual Models?,"Tianze Hua, Tian Yun, Ellie Pavlick","Many pretrained multilingual models exhibit cross-lingual transfer ability, which is often attributed to a learned language-neutral representation during pretraining. However, it remains unclear what factors contribute to the learning of a language-neutral representation, and whether the learned language-neutral representation suffices to facilitate cross-lingual transfer. We propose a synthetic task, Multilingual Othello (mOthello), as a testbed to delve into these two questions. We find that: (1) models trained with naive multilingual pretraining fail to learn a language-neutral representation across all input languages; (2) the introduction of ""anchor tokens"" (i.e., lexical items that are identical across languages) helps cross-lingual representation alignment; and (3) the learning of a language-neutral representation alone is not sufficient to facilitate cross-lingual transfer. Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach - multilingual pretraining with unified output space - that both induces the learning of language-neutral representation and facilitates cross-lingual transfer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12444v1,2024-04
BLINK: Multimodal Large Language Models Can See but Not Perceive,"Xingyu Fu, Yushi Hu, Bangzheng Li, Yu Feng, Haoyu Wang, Xudong Lin, Dan Roth, Noah A. Smith, Wei-Chiu Ma, Ranjay Krishna","We introduce Blink, a new benchmark for multimodal language models (LLMs) that focuses on core visual perception abilities not found in other evaluations. Most of the Blink tasks can be solved by humans ""within a blink"" (e.g., relative depth estimation, visual correspondence, forensics detection, and multi-view reasoning). However, we find these perception-demanding tasks cast significant challenges for current multimodal LLMs because they resist mediation through natural language. Blink reformats 14 classic computer vision tasks into 3,807 multiple-choice questions, paired with single or multiple images and visual prompting. While humans get 95.70% accuracy on average, Blink is surprisingly challenging for existing multimodal LLMs: even the best-performing GPT-4V and Gemini achieve accuracies of 51.26% and 45.72%, only 13.17% and 7.63% higher than random guessing, indicating that such perception abilities have not ""emerged"" yet in recent multimodal LLMs. Our analysis also highlights that specialist CV models could solve these problems much better, suggesting potential pathways for future improvements. We believe Blink will stimulate the community to help multimodal LLMs catch up with human-level visual perception.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12390v4,2024-04

Large Language Models in Targeted Sentiment Analysis,"Nicolay Rusnachenko, Anton Golubev, Natalia Loukachevitch","In this paper we investigate the use of decoder-based generative transformers for extracting sentiment towards the named entities in Russian news articles. We study sentiment analysis capabilities of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). We consider the dataset of RuSentNE-2023 in our study. The first group of experiments was aimed at the evaluation of zero-shot capabilities of LLMs with closed and open transparencies. The second covers the fine-tuning of Flan-T5 using the ""chain-of-thought"" (CoT) three-hop reasoning framework (THoR). We found that the results of the zero-shot approaches are similar to the results achieved by baseline fine-tuned encoder-based transformers (BERT-base). Reasoning capabilities of the fine-tuned Flan-T5 models with THoR achieve at least 5% increment with the base-size model compared to the results of the zero-shot experiment. The best results of sentiment analysis on RuSentNE-2023 were achieved by fine-tuned Flan-T5-xl, which surpassed the results of previous state-of-the-art transformer-based classifiers.

Reuse Your Rewards: Reward Model Transfer for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Alignment,"Zhaofeng Wu, Ananth Balashankar, Yoon Kim, Jacob Eisenstein, Ahmad Beirami","Aligning language models (LMs) based on human-annotated preference data is a crucial step in obtaining practical and performant LM-based systems. However, multilingual human preference data are difficult to obtain at scale, making it challenging to extend this framework to diverse languages. In this work, we evaluate a simple approach for zero-shot cross-lingual alignment, where a reward model is trained on preference data in one source language and directly applied to other target languages. On summarization and open-ended dialog generation, we show that this method is consistently successful under comprehensive evaluation settings, including human evaluation: cross-lingually aligned models are preferred by humans over unaligned models on up to >70% of evaluation instances. We moreover find that a different-language reward model sometimes yields better aligned models than a same-language reward model. We also identify best practices when there is no language-specific data for even supervised finetuning, another component in alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12318v2,2024-04
Simultaneous Interpretation Corpus Construction by Large Language Models in Distant Language Pair,"Yusuke Sakai, Mana Makinae, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe","In Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) systems, training with a simultaneous interpretation (SI) corpus is an effective method for achieving high-quality yet low-latency systems. However, it is very challenging to curate such a corpus due to limitations in the abilities of annotators, and hence, existing SI corpora are limited. Therefore, we propose a method to convert existing speech translation corpora into interpretation-style data, maintaining the original word order and preserving the entire source content using Large Language Models (LLM-SI-Corpus). We demonstrate that fine-tuning SiMT models in text-to-text and speech-to-text settings with the LLM-SI-Corpus reduces latencies while maintaining the same level of quality as the models trained with offline datasets.

In contrast, our methodology augments the detection process by integrating subtle emotional cues, augmented through LLMs, into three benchmark pre-trained NLP models - BERT, T5, and GPT-2 - which are widely recognized as foundational in irony detection.

Resilience through Scene Context in Visual Referring Expression Generation,"Simeon Junker, Sina Zarrieß","Scene context is well known to facilitate humans' perception of visible objects. In this paper, we investigate the role of context in Referring Expression Generation (REG) for objects in images, where existing research has often focused on distractor contexts that exert pressure on the generator. We take a new perspective on scene context in REG and hypothesize that contextual information can be conceived of as a resource that makes REG models more resilient and facilitates the generation of object descriptions, and object types in particular. We train and test Transformer-based REG models with target representations that have been artificially obscured with noise to varying degrees. We evaluate how properties of the models' visual context affect their processing and performance. Our results show that even simple scene contexts make models surprisingly resilient to perturbations, to the extent that they can identify referent types even when visual information about the target is completely missing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12289v2,2024-04
Enhancing Embedding Performance through Large Language Model-based Text Enrichment and Rewriting,"Nicholas Harris, Anand Butani, Syed Hashmy","Embedding models are crucial for various natural language processing tasks but can be limited by factors such as limited vocabulary, lack of context, and grammatical errors. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve embedding performance by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enrich and rewrite input text before the embedding process. By utilizing ChatGPT 3.5 to provide additional context, correct inaccuracies, and incorporate metadata, the proposed method aims to enhance the utility and accuracy of embedding models. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated on three datasets: Banking77Classification, TwitterSemEval 2015, and Amazon Counter-factual Classification. Results demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline model on the TwitterSemEval 2015 dataset, with the best-performing prompt achieving a score of 85.34 compared to the previous best of 81.52 on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard. However, performance on the other two datasets was less impressive, highlighting the importance of considering domain-specific characteristics. The findings suggest that LLM-based text enrichment has shown promising results to improve embedding performance, particularly in certain domains. Hence, numerous limitations in the process of embedding can be avoided.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12283v1,2024-04
Advancing the Robustness of Large Language Models through Self-Denoised Smoothing,"Jiabao Ji, Bairu Hou, Zhen Zhang, Guanhua Zhang, Wenqi Fan, Qing Li, Yang Zhang, Gaowen Liu, Sijia Liu, Shiyu Chang","Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, including recent jailbreak attacks, has raised considerable concerns. However, the increasing size of these models and their limited access make improving their robustness a challenging task. Among various defense strategies, randomized smoothing has shown great potential for LLMs, as it does not require full access to the model's parameters or fine-tuning via adversarial training. However, randomized smoothing involves adding noise to the input before model prediction, and the final model's robustness largely depends on the model's performance on these noise corrupted data. Its effectiveness is often limited by the model's sub-optimal performance on noisy data. To address this issue, we propose to leverage the multitasking nature of LLMs to first denoise the noisy inputs and then to make predictions based on these denoised versions. We call this procedure self-denoised smoothing. Unlike previous denoised smoothing techniques in computer vision, which require training a separate model to enhance the robustness of LLMs, our method offers significantly better efficiency and flexibility. Our experimental results indicate that our method surpasses existing methods in both empirical and certified robustness in defending against adversarial attacks for both downstream tasks and human alignments (i.e., jailbreak attacks).

FedEval-LLM: Federated Evaluation of Large Language Models on Downstream Tasks with Collective Wisdom,"Yuanqin He, Yan Kang, Lixin Fan, Qiang Yang","Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for collaborative training of large language models (LLMs). However, the integration of LLMs into FL introduces new challenges, particularly concerning the evaluation of LLMs. Traditional evaluation methods that rely on labeled test sets and similarity-based metrics cover only a subset of the acceptable answers, thereby failing to accurately reflect the performance of LLMs on generative tasks. Meanwhile, although automatic evaluation methods that leverage advanced LLMs present potential, they face critical risks of data leakage due to the need to transmit data to external servers and suboptimal performance on downstream tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a Federated Evaluation framework of Large Language Models, named FedEval-LLM, that provides reliable performance measurements of LLMs on downstream tasks without the reliance on labeled test sets and external tools, thus ensuring strong privacy-preserving capability. FedEval-LLM leverages a consortium of personalized LLMs from participants as referees to provide domain knowledge and collective evaluation capability, thus aligning to the respective downstream tasks and mitigating uncertainties and biases associated with a single referee. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in the evaluation capability of personalized evaluation models on downstream tasks. When applied to FL, these evaluation models exhibit strong agreement with human preference and RougeL-score on meticulously curated test sets. FedEval-LLM effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional metrics and the reliance on external services, making it a promising framework for the evaluation of LLMs within collaborative training scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12273v1,2024-04
"Toward Self-Improvement of LLMs via Imagination, Searching, and Criticizing","Ye Tian, Baolin Peng, Linfeng Song, Lifeng Jin, Dian Yu, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu","Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various tasks, they still struggle with scenarios that involves complex reasoning and planning. Recent work proposed advanced prompting techniques and the necessity of fine-tuning with high-quality data to augment LLMs' reasoning abilities. However, these approaches are inherently constrained by data availability and quality. In light of this, self-correction and self-learning emerge as viable solutions, employing strategies that allow LLMs to refine their outputs and learn from self-assessed rewards. Yet, the efficacy of LLMs in self-refining its response, particularly in complex reasoning and planning task, remains dubious. In this paper, we introduce AlphaLLM for the self-improvements of LLMs, which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with LLMs to establish a self-improving loop, thereby enhancing the capabilities of LLMs without additional annotations. Drawing inspiration from the success of AlphaGo, AlphaLLM addresses the unique challenges of combining MCTS with LLM for self-improvement, including data scarcity, the vastness search spaces of language tasks, and the subjective nature of feedback in language tasks. AlphaLLM is comprised of prompt synthesis component, an efficient MCTS approach tailored for language tasks, and a trio of critic models for precise feedback. Our experimental results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that AlphaLLM significantly enhances the performance of LLMs without additional annotations, showing the potential for self-improvement in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12253v2,2024-04

The AI Safety Benchmark has been designed to assess the safety risks of AI systems that use chat-tuned language models. We introduce a principled approach to specifying and constructing the benchmark, which for v0.5 covers only a single use case (an adult chatting to a general-purpose assistant in English), and a limited set of personas (i.e., typical users, malicious users, and vulnerable users). We created a new taxonomy of 13 hazard categories, of which 7 have tests in the v0.5 benchmark. We plan to release version 1.0 of the AI Safety Benchmark by the end of 2024. The v1.0 benchmark will provide meaningful insights into the safety of AI systems. However, the v0.5 benchmark should not be used to assess the safety of AI systems. We have sought to fully document the limitations, flaws, and challenges of v0.5. This release of v0.5 of the AI Safety Benchmark includes (1) a principled approach to specifying and constructing the benchmark, which comprises use cases, types of systems under test (SUTs), language and context, personas, tests, and test items; (2) a taxonomy of 13 hazard categories with definitions and subcategories; (3) tests for seven of the hazard categories, each comprising a unique set of test items, i.e., prompts. There are 43,090 test items in total, which we created with templates; (4) a grading system for AI systems against the benchmark; (5) an openly available platform, and downloadable tool, called ModelBench that can be used to evaluate the safety of AI systems on the benchmark; (6) an example evaluation report which benchmarks the performance of over a dozen openly available chat-tuned language models; (7) a test specification for the benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12241v2,2024-04
Length Generalization of Causal Transformers without Position Encoding,"Jie Wang, Tao Ji, Yuanbin Wu, Hang Yan, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang, Xiaoling Wang","Generalizing to longer sentences is important for recent Transformer-based language models. Besides algorithms manipulating explicit position features, the success of Transformers without position encodings (NoPE) provides a new way to overcome the challenge. In this paper, we study the length generalization property of NoPE. We find that although NoPE can extend to longer sequences than the commonly used explicit position encodings, it still has a limited context length. We identify a connection between the failure of NoPE's generalization and the distraction of attention distributions. We propose a parameter-efficient tuning for searching attention heads' best temperature hyper-parameters, which substantially expands NoPE's context size. Experiments on long sequence language modeling, the synthetic passkey retrieval task and real-world long context tasks show that NoPE can achieve competitive performances with state-of-the-art length generalization algorithms.

"OpenBezoar: Small, Cost-Effective and Open Models Trained on Mixes of Instruction Data","Chandeepa Dissanayake, Lahiru Lowe, Sachith Gunasekara, Yasiru Ratnayake","Instruction fine-tuning pretrained LLMs for diverse downstream tasks has demonstrated remarkable success and has captured the interest of both academics and practitioners. To ensure such fine-tuned LLMs align with human preferences, techniques such as RLHF and DPO have emerged. At the same time, there is increasing interest in smaller parameter counts for models. In this work, using OpenLLaMA 3Bv2 as a base model, we describe the recipe used to fine-tune the OpenBezoar family of models. In this recipe: We first generate synthetic instruction fine-tuning data using an open and commercially non-restrictive instruction fine-tuned variant of the Falcon-40B model under three schemes based on: LaMini-LM, WizardLM/Evol-Instruct (with databricks-dolly-15k as a seed dataset) and Orca (with the Flan Collection as a seed dataset), then filter these generations using GPT-4 as a human proxy. We then perform cost-effective QLoRA-based supervised fine-tuning sequentially with each scheme. The resulting checkpoint is further fine-tuned with a subset of the HH-RLHF dataset to minimize distribution shift prior to using the DPO loss to obtain the final checkpoint. Evaluation is done with the LM Eval Harness tasks/metrics as well as on MT-Bench using the ""LLM-as-a-judge"" framework with Claude 2.1, with the finding that the final checkpoint, ""OpenBezoar-HH-RLHF-DPO"", demonstrates superior performance over many models at the 3B parameter scale, even outperforming the top model in one of the categories on the Huggingface Open LLM Leaderboard. We release ""OpenBezoar-SFT"", ""OpenBezoar-HH-RLHF-SFT"", ""OpenBezoar-HH-RLHF-DPO"" checkpoints, alongside our generated datasets on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/collections/SurgeGlobal/open-bezoar-6620a24923e12127e9e2b9cc and our codebase at https://bitbucket.org/paladinanalytics/workspace/projects/OP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12195v1,2024-04
EuSQuAD: Automatically Translated and Aligned SQuAD2.0 for Basque,"Aitor García-Pablos, Naiara Perez, Montse Cuadros, Jaione Bengoetxea","The widespread availability of Question Answering (QA) datasets in English has greatly facilitated the advancement of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. However, the scarcity of such resources for minority languages, such as Basque, poses a substantial challenge for these communities. In this context, the translation and alignment of existing QA datasets plays a crucial role in narrowing this technological gap. This work presents EuSQuAD, the first initiative dedicated to automatically translating and aligning SQuAD2.0 into Basque, resulting in more than 142k QA examples. We demonstrate EuSQuAD's value through extensive qualitative analysis and QA experiments supported with EuSQuAD as training data. These experiments are evaluated with a new human-annotated dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12177v2,2024-04
Claim Check-Worthiness Detection: How Well do LLMs Grasp Annotation Guidelines?,"Laura Majer, Jan Šnajder","The increasing threat of disinformation calls for automating parts of the fact-checking pipeline. Identifying text segments requiring fact-checking is known as claim detection (CD) and claim check-worthiness detection (CW), the latter incorporating complex domain-specific criteria of worthiness and often framed as a ranking task. Zero- and few-shot LLM prompting is an attractive option for both tasks, as it bypasses the need for labeled datasets and allows verbalized claim and worthiness criteria to be directly used for prompting. We evaluate the LLMs' predictive and calibration accuracy on five CD/CW datasets from diverse domains, each utilizing a different worthiness criterion. We investigate two key aspects: (1) how best to distill factuality and worthiness criteria into a prompt and (2) what amount of context to provide for each claim. To this end, we experiment with varying the level of prompt verbosity and the amount of contextual information provided to the model. Our results show that optimal prompt verbosity is domain-dependent, adding context does not improve performance, and confidence scores can be directly used to produce reliable check-worthiness rankings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12174v2,2024-04
Stance Detection on Social Media with Fine-Tuned Large Language Models,"İlker Gül, Rémi Lebret, Karl Aberer","Stance detection, a key task in natural language processing, determines an author's viewpoint based on textual analysis. This study evaluates the evolution of stance detection methods, transitioning from early machine learning approaches to the groundbreaking BERT model, and eventually to modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Mistral-7B. While ChatGPT's closed-source nature and associated costs present challenges, the open-source models like LLaMa-2 and Mistral-7B offers an encouraging alternative. Initially, our research focused on fine-tuning ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Mistral-7B using several publicly available datasets. Subsequently, to provide a comprehensive comparison, we assess the performance of these models in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. The results underscore the exceptional ability of LLMs in accurately detecting stance, with all tested models surpassing existing benchmarks. Notably, LLaMa-2 and Mistral-7B demonstrate remarkable efficiency and potential for stance detection, despite their smaller sizes compared to ChatGPT. This study emphasizes the potential of LLMs in stance detection and calls for more extensive research in this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12171v1,2024-04
FecTek: Enhancing Term Weight in Lexicon-Based Retrieval with Feature Context and Term-level Knowledge,"Zunran Wang, Zhonghua Li, Wei Shen, Qi Ye, Liqiang Nie","Lexicon-based retrieval has gained siginificant popularity in text retrieval due to its efficient and robust performance. To further enhance performance of lexicon-based retrieval, researchers have been diligently incorporating state-of-the-art methodologies like Neural retrieval and text-level contrastive learning approaches. Nonetheless, despite the promising outcomes, current lexicon-based retrieval methods have received limited attention in exploring the potential benefits of feature context representations and term-level knowledge guidance. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method by introducing FEature Context and TErm-level Knowledge modules(FecTek). To effectively enrich the feature context representations of term weight, the Feature Context Module (FCM) is introduced, which leverages the power of BERT's representation to determine dynamic weights for each element in the embedding. Additionally, we develop a term-level knowledge guidance module (TKGM) for effectively utilizing term-level knowledge to intelligently guide the modeling process of term weight. Evaluation of the proposed method on MS Marco benchmark demonstrates its superiority over the previous state-of-the-art approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12152v1,2024-04
Aligning language models with human preferences,Tomasz Korbak,"Language models (LMs) trained on vast quantities of text data can acquire sophisticated skills such as generating summaries, answering questions or generating code. However, they also manifest behaviors that violate human preferences, e.g., they can generate offensive content, falsehoods or perpetuate social biases. In this thesis, I explore several approaches to aligning LMs with human preferences. First, I argue that aligning LMs can be seen as Bayesian inference: conditioning a prior (base, pretrained LM) on evidence about human preferences (Chapter 2). Conditioning on human preferences can be implemented in numerous ways. In Chapter 3, I investigate the relation between two approaches to finetuning pretrained LMs using feedback given by a scoring function: reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and distribution matching. I show that RLHF can be seen as a special case of distribution matching but distributional matching is strictly more general. In chapter 4, I show how to extend the distribution matching to conditional language models. Finally, in chapter 5 I explore a different root: conditioning an LM on human preferences already during pretraining. I show that involving human feedback from the very start tends to be more effective than using it only during supervised finetuning. Overall, these results highlight the room for alignment techniques different from and complementary to RLHF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12150v1,2024-04
From Form(s) to Meaning: Probing the Semantic Depths of Language Models Using Multisense Consistency,"Xenia Ohmer, Elia Bruni, Dieuwke Hupkes","The staggering pace with which the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are increasing, as measured by a range of commonly used natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks, raises many questions regarding what ""understanding"" means for a language model and how it compares to human understanding. This is especially true since many LLMs are exclusively trained on text, casting doubt on whether their stellar benchmark performances are reflective of a true understanding of the problems represented by these benchmarks, or whether LLMs simply excel at uttering textual forms that correlate with what someone who understands the problem would say. In this philosophically inspired work, we aim to create some separation between form and meaning, with a series of tests that leverage the idea that world understanding should be consistent across presentational modes - inspired by Fregean senses - of the same meaning. Specifically, we focus on consistency across languages as well as paraphrases. Taking GPT-3.5 as our object of study, we evaluate multisense consistency across five different languages and various tasks. We start the evaluation in a controlled setting, asking the model for simple facts, and then proceed with an evaluation on four popular NLU benchmarks. We find that the model's multisense consistency is lacking and run several follow-up analyses to verify that this lack of consistency is due to a sense-dependent task understanding. We conclude that, in this aspect, the understanding of LLMs is still quite far from being consistent and human-like, and deliberate on how this impacts their utility in the context of learning about human language and understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12145v1,2024-04
Non-Invasive Suicide Risk Prediction Through Speech Analysis,"Shahin Amiriparian, Maurice Gerczuk, Justina Lutz, Wolfgang Strube, Irina Papazova, Alkomiet Hasan, Alexander Kathan, Björn W. Schuller","The delayed access to specialized psychiatric assessments and care for patients at risk of suicidal tendencies in emergency departments creates a notable gap in timely intervention, hindering the provision of adequate mental health support during critical situations. To address this, we present a non-invasive, speech-based approach for automatic suicide risk assessment. For our study, we collected a novel speech recording dataset from $20$ patients. We extract three sets of features, including wav2vec, interpretable speech and acoustic features, and deep learning-based spectral representations. We proceed by conducting a binary classification to assess suicide risk in a leave-one-subject-out fashion. Our most effective speech model achieves a balanced accuracy of $66.2\,\%$. Moreover, we show that integrating our speech model with a series of patients' metadata, such as the history of suicide attempts or access to firearms, improves the overall result. The metadata integration yields a balanced accuracy of $94.4\,\%$, marking an absolute improvement of $28.2\,\%$, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approaches for automatic suicide risk assessment in emergency medicine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12132v3,2024-04
Ethical-Lens: Curbing Malicious Usages of Open-Source Text-to-Image Models,"Yuzhu Cai, Sheng Yin, Yuxi Wei, Chenxin Xu, Weibo Mao, Felix Juefei-Xu, Siheng Chen, Yanfeng Wang","The burgeoning landscape of text-to-image models, exemplified by innovations such as Midjourney and DALLE 3, has revolutionized content creation across diverse sectors. However, these advancements bring forth critical ethical concerns, particularly with the misuse of open-source models to generate content that violates societal norms. Addressing this, we introduce Ethical-Lens, a framework designed to facilitate the value-aligned usage of text-to-image tools without necessitating internal model revision. Ethical-Lens ensures value alignment in text-to-image models across toxicity and bias dimensions by refining user commands and rectifying model outputs. Systematic evaluation metrics, combining GPT4-V, HEIM, and FairFace scores, assess alignment capability. Our experiments reveal that Ethical-Lens enhances alignment capabilities to levels comparable with or superior to commercial models like DALLE 3, ensuring user-generated content adheres to ethical standards while maintaining image quality. This study indicates the potential of Ethical-Lens to ensure the sustainable development of open-source text-to-image tools and their beneficial integration into society.

LongEmbed: Extending Embedding Models for Long Context Retrieval,"Dawei Zhu, Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Furu Wei, Sujian Li","Embedding models play a pivot role in modern NLP applications such as IR and RAG. While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens, embedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k tokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as legal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional training. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for long context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed comprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying length and dispersed target information. Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models. Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window extension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the context window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of their original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models employing absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further fine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving original behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding (RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific methods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for context window extension. To facilitate future research, we release E5-Base-4k and E5-RoPE-Base, along with the LongEmbed benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12096v3,2024-04
TIMIT Speaker Profiling: A Comparison of Multi-task learning and Single-task learning Approaches,"Rong Wang, Kun Sun","This study employs deep learning techniques to explore four speaker profiling tasks on the TIMIT dataset, namely gender classification, accent classification, age estimation, and speaker identification, highlighting the potential and challenges of multi-task learning versus single-task models. The motivation for this research is twofold: firstly, to empirically assess the advantages and drawbacks of multi-task learning over single-task models in the context of speaker profiling; secondly, to emphasize the undiminished significance of skillful feature engineering for speaker recognition tasks. The findings reveal challenges in accent classification, and multi-task learning is found advantageous for tasks of similar complexity. Non-sequential features are favored for speaker recognition, but sequential ones can serve as starting points for complex models. The study underscores the necessity of meticulous experimentation and parameter tuning for deep learning models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12077v1,2024-04

We tackle this issue using a multimodal large language model in conjunction with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and introduce two novel reasoning techniques: Chain of RAG (CoRAG) and Tree of RAG (ToRAG). They fact-check multimodal claims by extracting both textual and image content, retrieving external information, and reasoning subsequent questions to be answered based on prior evidence. We achieve a weighted F1-score of 0.85, surpassing a baseline reasoning technique by 0.14 points.

Unsupervised Parsing by Searching for Frequent Word Sequences among Sentences with Equivalent Predicate-Argument Structures,"Junjie Chen, Xiangheng He, Danushka Bollegala, Yusuke Miyao","Unsupervised constituency parsing focuses on identifying word sequences that form a syntactic unit (i.e., constituents) in target sentences. Linguists identify the constituent by evaluating a set of Predicate-Argument Structure (PAS) equivalent sentences where we find the constituent appears more frequently than non-constituents (i.e., the constituent corresponds to a frequent word sequence within the sentence set). However, such frequency information is unavailable in previous parsing methods that identify the constituent by observing sentences with diverse PAS. In this study, we empirically show that constituents correspond to frequent word sequences in the PAS-equivalent sentence set. We propose a frequency-based parser span-overlap that (1) computes the span-overlap score as the word sequence's frequency in the PAS-equivalent sentence set and (2) identifies the constituent structure by finding a constituent tree with the maximum span-overlap score. The parser achieves state-of-the-art level parsing accuracy, outperforming existing unsupervised parsers in eight out of ten languages. Additionally, we discover a multilingual phenomenon: participant-denoting constituents tend to have higher span-overlap scores than equal-length event-denoting constituents, meaning that the former tend to appear more frequently in the PAS-equivalent sentence set than the latter. The phenomenon indicates a statistical difference between the two constituent types, laying the foundation for future labeled unsupervised parsing research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12059v2,2024-04
"emrQA-msquad: A Medical Dataset Structured with the SQuAD V2.0 Framework, Enriched with emrQA Medical Information","Jimenez Eladio, Hao Wu","Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) holds a pivotal role in shaping Medical Question Answering Systems (QAS) and transforming the landscape of accessing and applying medical information. However, the inherent challenges in the medical field, such as complex terminology and question ambiguity, necessitate innovative solutions. One key solution involves integrating specialized medical datasets and creating dedicated datasets. This strategic approach enhances the accuracy of QAS, contributing to advancements in clinical decision-making and medical research. To address the intricacies of medical terminology, a specialized dataset was integrated, exemplified by a novel Span extraction dataset derived from emrQA but restructured into 163,695 questions and 4,136 manually obtained answers, this new dataset was called emrQA-msquad dataset.

Exploring Boundaries and Intensities in Offensive and Hate Speech: Unveiling the Complex Spectrum of Social Media Discourse,"Abinew Ali Ayele, Esubalew Alemneh Jalew, Adem Chanie Ali, Seid Muhie Yimam, Chris Biemann","The prevalence of digital media and evolving sociopolitical dynamics have significantly amplified the dissemination of hateful content. Existing studies mainly focus on classifying texts into binary categories, often overlooking the continuous spectrum of offensiveness and hatefulness inherent in the text. In this research, we present an extensive benchmark dataset for Amharic, comprising 8,258 tweets annotated for three distinct tasks: category classification, identification of hate targets, and rating offensiveness and hatefulness intensities. Our study highlights that a considerable majority of tweets belong to the less offensive and less hate intensity levels, underscoring the need for early interventions by stakeholders. The prevalence of ethnic and political hatred targets, with significant overlaps in our dataset, emphasizes the complex relationships within Ethiopia's sociopolitical landscape. We build classification and regression models and investigate the efficacy of models in handling these tasks. Our results reveal that hate and offensive speech can not be addressed by a simplistic binary classification, instead manifesting as variables across a continuous range of values. The Afro-XLMR-large model exhibits the best performances achieving F1-scores of 75.30%, 70.59%, and 29.42% for the category, target, and regression tasks, respectively.

Uncovering Safety Risks of Large Language Models through Concept Activation Vector,"Zhihao Xu, Ruixuan Huang, Changyu Chen, Xiting Wang","Despite careful safety alignment, current large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to various attacks. To further unveil the safety risks of LLMs, we introduce a Safety Concept Activation Vector (SCAV) framework, which effectively guides the attacks by accurately interpreting LLMs' safety mechanisms. We then develop an SCAV-guided attack method that can generate both attack prompts and embedding-level attacks with automatically selected perturbation hyperparameters. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our attack method significantly improves the attack success rate and response quality while requiring less training data. Additionally, we find that our generated attack prompts may be transferable to GPT-4, and the embedding-level attacks may also be transferred to other white-box LLMs whose parameters are known. Our experiments further uncover the safety risks present in current LLMs. For example, in our evaluation of seven open-source LLMs, we observe an average attack success rate of 99.14%, based on the classic keyword-matching criterion. Finally, we provide insights into the safety mechanism of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/SproutNan/AI-Safety_SCAV.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12038v5,2024-04
Parallel Decoding via Hidden Transfer for Lossless Large Language Model Acceleration,"Pengfei Wu, Jiahao Liu, Zhuocheng Gong, Qifan Wang, Jinpeng Li, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Dongyan Zhao","Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, the substantial number of parameters in LLMs contributes to significant latency during model inference. This is particularly evident when utilizing autoregressive decoding methods, which generate one token in a single forward process, thereby not fully capitalizing on the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel decoding approach, namely \textit{hidden transfer}, which decodes multiple successive tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass. The idea is to transfer the intermediate hidden states of the previous context to the \textit{pseudo} hidden states of the future tokens to be generated, and then the pseudo hidden states will pass the following transformer layers thereby assimilating more semantic information and achieving superior predictive accuracy of the future tokens.   Besides, we use the novel tree attention mechanism to simultaneously generate and verify multiple candidates of output sequences, which ensure the lossless generation and further improves the generation efficiency of our method. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We conduct a lot of analytic experiments to prove our motivation. In terms of acceleration metrics, we outperform all the single-model acceleration techniques, including Medusa and Self-Speculative decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12022v1,2024-04
Enhance Robustness of Language Models Against Variation Attack through Graph Integration,"Zi Xiong, Lizhi Qing, Yangyang Kang, Jiawei Liu, Hongsong Li, Changlong Sun, Xiaozhong Liu, Wei Lu","The widespread use of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) has greatly improved performance outcomes. However, these models' vulnerability to adversarial attacks (e.g., camouflaged hints from drug dealers), particularly in the Chinese language with its rich character diversity/variation and complex structures, hatches vital apprehension. In this study, we propose a novel method, CHinese vAriatioN Graph Enhancement (CHANGE), to increase the robustness of PLMs against character variation attacks in Chinese content. CHANGE presents a novel approach for incorporating a Chinese character variation graph into the PLMs. Through designing different supplementary tasks utilizing the graph structure, CHANGE essentially enhances PLMs' interpretation of adversarially manipulated text. Experiments conducted in a multitude of NLP tasks show that CHANGE outperforms current language models in combating against adversarial attacks and serves as a valuable contribution to robust language model research.

However, a pressing question that remains is their genuine capability for stronger forms of generalization, which has been largely underexplored in the multimodal setting. Our study aims to address this by examining sequential compositional generalization using \textsc{CompAct} (\underline{Comp}ositional \underline{Act}ivities)\footnote{Project Page: \url{http://cyberiada.github.io/CompAct}}, a carefully constructed, perceptually grounded dataset set within a rich backdrop of egocentric kitchen activity videos.

ParaFusion: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven English Paraphrase Dataset Infused with High-Quality Lexical and Syntactic Diversity,"Lasal Jayawardena, Prasan Yapa","Paraphrase generation is a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP). Existing datasets in the domain lack syntactic and lexical diversity, resulting in paraphrases that closely resemble the source sentences. Moreover, these datasets often contain hate speech and noise, and may unintentionally include non-English language sentences. This research introduces ParaFusion, a large-scale, high-quality English paraphrase dataset developed using Large Language Models (LLM) to address these challenges. ParaFusion augments existing datasets with high-quality data, significantly enhancing both lexical and syntactic diversity while maintaining close semantic similarity. It also mitigates the presence of hate speech and reduces noise, ensuring a cleaner and more focused English dataset. Results show that ParaFusion offers at least a 25% improvement in both syntactic and lexical diversity, measured across several metrics for each data source.

Variational Multi-Modal Hypergraph Attention Network for Multi-Modal Relation Extraction,"Qian Li, Cheng Ji, Shu Guo, Yong Zhao, Qianren Mao, Shangguang Wang, Yuntao Wei, Jianxin Li","Multi-modal relation extraction (MMRE) is a challenging task that aims to identify relations between entities in text leveraging image information. Existing methods are limited by their neglect of the multiple entity pairs in one sentence sharing very similar contextual information (ie, the same text and image), resulting in increased difficulty in the MMRE task. To address this limitation, we propose the Variational Multi-Modal Hypergraph Attention Network (VM-HAN) for multi-modal relation extraction. Specifically, we first construct a multi-modal hypergraph for each sentence with the corresponding image, to establish different high-order intra-/inter-modal correlations for different entity pairs in each sentence. We further design the Variational Hypergraph Attention Networks (V-HAN) to obtain representational diversity among different entity pairs using Gaussian distribution and learn a better hypergraph structure via variational attention. VM-HAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-modal relation extraction task, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12006v1,2024-04
Token-level Direct Preference Optimization,"Yongcheng Zeng, Guoqing Liu, Weiyu Ma, Ning Yang, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang","Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential to align them with human values and intentions. This process often utilizes methods like pairwise comparisons and KL divergence against a reference LLM, focusing on the evaluation of full answers generated by the models. However, the generation of these responses occurs in a token level, following a sequential, auto-regressive fashion. In this paper, we introduce Token-level Direct Preference Optimization (TDPO), a novel approach to align LLMs with human preferences by optimizing policy at the token level. Unlike previous methods, which face challenges in divergence efficiency, TDPO incorporates forward KL divergence constraints for each token, improving alignment and diversity. Utilizing the Bradley-Terry model for a token-based reward system, TDPO enhances the regulation of KL divergence, while preserving simplicity without the need for explicit reward modeling. Experimental results across various text tasks demonstrate TDPO's superior performance in balancing alignment with generation diversity. Notably, fine-tuning with TDPO strikes a better balance than DPO in the controlled sentiment generation and single-turn dialogue datasets, and significantly improves the quality of generated responses compared to both DPO and PPO-based RLHF methods. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Vance0124/Token-level-Direct-Preference-Optimization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11999v5,2024-04
EVIT: Event-Oriented Instruction Tuning for Event Reasoning,"Zhengwei Tao, Xiancai Chen, Zhi Jin, Xiaoying Bai, Haiyan Zhao, Yiwei Lou","Events refer to specific occurrences, incidents, or happenings that take place under a particular background. Event reasoning aims to infer events according to certain relations and predict future events. The cutting-edge techniques for event reasoning play a crucial role in various natural language processing applications. Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in event reasoning owing to their wealth of knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, smaller instruction-tuned models currently in use do not consistently demonstrate exceptional proficiency in managing these tasks. This discrepancy arises from the absence of explicit modeling of events and the interconnections of them within their instruction data. Consequently, these models face challenges in comprehending event structures and semantics while struggling to bridge the gap between their interpretations and human understanding of events. Additionally, their limitations in grasping event relations lead to constrained event reasoning abilities to effectively deduce and incorporate pertinent event knowledge. In this paper, we propose Event-Oriented Instruction Tuning (EvIT) to train our LLM. Specifically, we first propose a novel structure named event quadruple which contains the structure and semantics of events and is complete in the event representation. We then design event-relation learning based on the structures. We encapsulate the learning into the instruction-tuning formulation to better stimulate the event reasoning capacity of our model. We design a heuristic unsupervised method to mine event quadruple from a large-scale corpus. At last, we finetune a Llama model on our Event-Oriented Instruction Tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on event reasoning tasks on several datasets. Automatic and human evaluations demonstrate EvIT achieves competitive performances on event reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11978v1,2024-04
Aligning Language Models to Explicitly Handle Ambiguity,"Hyuhng Joon Kim, Youna Kim, Cheonbok Park, Junyeob Kim, Choonghyun Park, Kang Min Yoo, Sang-goo Lee, Taeuk Kim","In interactions between users and language model agents, user utterances frequently exhibit ellipsis (omission of words or phrases) or imprecision (lack of exactness) to prioritize efficiency. This can lead to varying interpretations of the same input based on different assumptions or background knowledge. It is thus crucial for agents to adeptly handle the inherent ambiguity in queries to ensure reliability. However, even state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) still face challenges in such scenarios, primarily due to the following hurdles: (1) LLMs are not explicitly trained to deal with ambiguous utterances; (2) the degree of ambiguity perceived by the LLMs may vary depending on the possessed knowledge. To address these issues, we propose Alignment with Perceived Ambiguity (APA), a novel pipeline that aligns LLMs to manage ambiguous queries by leveraging their own assessment of ambiguity (i.e., perceived ambiguity). Experimental results on question-answering datasets demonstrate that APA empowers LLMs to explicitly detect and manage ambiguous queries while retaining the ability to answer clear questions. Furthermore, our finding proves that APA excels beyond training with gold-standard labels, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. The data and code are available at https://github.com/heyjoonkim/APA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11972v3,2024-04
NALA: an Effective and Interpretable Entity Alignment Method,"Chuanhao Xu, Jingwei Cheng, Fu Zhang","Entity alignment (EA) aims to find equivalent entities between two Knowledge Graphs. Existing embedding-based EA methods usually encode entities as embeddings, triples as embeddings' constraint and learn to align the embeddings. However, the details of the underlying logical inference steps among the alignment process are usually omitted, resulting in inadequate inference process. In this paper, we introduce NALA, an entity alignment method that captures three types of logical inference paths with Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL). Type 1&2 align the entity pairs and type 3 aligns relations. NALA iteratively aligns entities and relations by integrating the conclusions of the inference paths. Our method is logically interpretable and extensible by introducing NAL, and thus suitable for various EA settings. Experimental results show that NALA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of Hits@1, achieving 0.98+ on all three datasets of DBP15K with both supervised and unsupervised settings. We offer a pioneering in-depth analysis of the fundamental principles of entity alignment, approaching the subject from a unified and logical perspective.

CrossIn: An Efficient Instruction Tuning Approach for Cross-Lingual Knowledge Alignment,"Geyu Lin, Bin Wang, Zhengyuan Liu, Nancy F. Chen","Multilingual proficiency presents a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). English-centric models are usually suboptimal in other languages, particularly those that are linguistically distant from English. This performance discrepancy mainly stems from the imbalanced distribution of training data across languages during pre-training and instruction tuning stages. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach called CrossIn, which utilizes a mixed composition of cross-lingual instruction tuning data. Our method leverages the compressed representation shared by various languages to efficiently enhance the model's task-solving capabilities and multilingual proficiency within a single process. In addition, we introduce a multi-task and multi-faceted benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of CrossIn. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves performance across tasks and languages, and we provide extensive insights into the impact of cross-lingual data volume and the integration of translation data on enhancing multilingual consistency and accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11932v3,2024-04
Skeleton: A New Framework for Accelerating Language Models via Task Neuron Localized Prompt Tuning,"Nakyeong Yang, Jiwon Moon, Junseok Kim, Yunah Jang, Kyomin Jung","Prompt tuning methods have shown comparable performance to general training methods as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods in various natural language understanding tasks. However, existing prompt tuning methods still utilize the entire model architecture even when solving a specific task, which prevents them from accelerating inference speed during the application procedure. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt tuning framework called Skeleton to efficiently utilize a language model in terms of memory and time complexity for solving various tasks, retaining only task-relevant neurons by using an explainability method. From our framework, we can efficiently solve various tasks by using only task-relevant neurons and prepending adequate task-specific prompt tokens with only a single language model. Experiments reveal that our method significantly enhances inference efficiency (at most x 1.73 speed up) for various widely used benchmarks, showing comparable performance to the prompt tuning method. Moreover, our method is applicable across various transformer-based architectures, confirming its practicality and scalability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11916v2,2024-04
TriForce: Lossless Acceleration of Long Sequence Generation with Hierarchical Speculative Decoding,"Hanshi Sun, Zhuoming Chen, Xinyu Yang, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen","With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11912v3,2024-04
Large Language Models Can Solve Real-World Planning Rigorously with Formal Verification Tools,"Yilun Hao, Yongchao Chen, Yang Zhang, Chuchu Fan","Despite their recent advancements, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to directly generate correct plans for complex multi-constraint planning problems, even with self-verification and self-critique. For example, a U.S. domestic travel planning benchmark TravelPlanner was proposed in Xie et al. (2024), where the best LLM OpenAI o1-preview can only find travel plans that satisfy user requirements with a 10% success rate given all needed information. In this work, we tackle this difficult problem by proposing an LLM-based planning framework that formalizes and solves complex multi-constraint planning problems as constrained satisfiability problems, which are further consumed by sound and complete satisfiability solvers. We start with TravelPlanner as the primary use case and achieve a success rate of 93.9%. We demonstrate our framework's robustness by showing its effectiveness in diverse paraphrased prompts. More importantly, our framework has strong zero-shot generalizability: It can successfully handle unseen constraints in a completely unseen international travel dataset we created, and it can even generalize well to new domains such as routing and task allocation problems in a zero-shot manner. Moreover, when user input queries are infeasible, our framework can identify the unsatisfiable core, provide failure reasons, and offers personalized modification suggestions to users according to diverse human preferences. We show that our framework can modify and solve for an average of 81.6% and 91.7% unsatisfiable queries from two datasets and prove with ablations that all key components of our framework are effective and necessary.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11891v2,2024-04
Enhancing Length Extrapolation in Sequential Models with Pointer-Augmented Neural Memory,"Hung Le, Dung Nguyen, Kien Do, Svetha Venkatesh, Truyen Tran","We propose Pointer-Augmented Neural Memory (PANM) to help neural networks understand and apply symbol processing to new, longer sequences of data. PANM integrates an external neural memory that uses novel physical addresses and pointer manipulation techniques to mimic human and computer symbol processing abilities. PANM facilitates pointer assignment, dereference, and arithmetic by explicitly using physical pointers to access memory content. Remarkably, it can learn to perform these operations through end-to-end training on sequence data, powering various sequential models. Our experiments demonstrate PANM's exceptional length extrapolating capabilities and improved performance in tasks that require symbol processing, such as algorithmic reasoning and Dyck language recognition. PANM helps Transformer achieve up to 100% generalization accuracy in compositional learning tasks and significantly better results in mathematical reasoning, question answering and machine translation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11870v1,2024-04
Challenging Negative Gender Stereotypes: A Study on the Effectiveness of Automated Counter-Stereotypes,"Isar Nejadgholi, Kathleen C. Fraser, Anna Kerkhof, Svetlana Kiritchenko","Gender stereotypes are pervasive beliefs about individuals based on their gender that play a significant role in shaping societal attitudes, behaviours, and even opportunities. Recognizing the negative implications of gender stereotypes, particularly in online communications, this study investigates eleven strategies to automatically counter-act and challenge these views. We present AI-generated gender-based counter-stereotypes to (self-identified) male and female study participants and ask them to assess their offensiveness, plausibility, and potential effectiveness. The strategies of counter-facts and broadening universals (i.e., stating that anyone can have a trait regardless of group membership) emerged as the most robust approaches, while humour, perspective-taking, counter-examples, and empathy for the speaker were perceived as less effective. Also, the differences in ratings were more pronounced for stereotypes about the different targets than between the genders of the raters. Alarmingly, many AI-generated counter-stereotypes were perceived as offensive and/or implausible. Our analysis and the collected dataset offer foundational insight into counter-stereotype generation, guiding future efforts to develop strategies that effectively challenge gender stereotypes in online interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11845v1,2024-04
AdvisorQA: Towards Helpful and Harmless Advice-seeking Question Answering with Collective Intelligence,"Minbeom Kim, Hwanhee Lee, Joonsuk Park, Hwaran Lee, Kyomin Jung","As the integration of large language models into daily life is on the rise, there is a clear gap in benchmarks for advising on subjective and personal dilemmas. To address this, we introduce AdvisorQA, the first benchmark developed to assess LLMs' capability in offering advice for deeply personalized concerns, utilizing the LifeProTips subreddit forum. This forum features a dynamic interaction where users post advice-seeking questions, receiving an average of 8.9 advice per query, with 164.2 upvotes from hundreds of users, embodying a collective intelligence framework. Therefore, we've completed a benchmark encompassing daily life questions, diverse corresponding responses, and majority vote ranking to train our helpfulness metric. Baseline experiments validate the efficacy of AdvisorQA through our helpfulness metric, GPT-4, and human evaluation, analyzing phenomena beyond the trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness. AdvisorQA marks a significant leap in enhancing QA systems for providing personalized, empathetic advice, showcasing LLMs' improved understanding of human subjectivity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11826v1,2024-04
NL2FOL: Translating Natural Language to First-Order Logic for Logical Fallacy Detection,"Abhinav Lalwani, Lovish Chopra, Christopher Hahn, Caroline Trippel, Zhijing Jin, Mrinmaya Sachan","Logical fallacies are common errors in reasoning that undermine the logic of an argument. Automatically detecting logical fallacies has important applications in tracking misinformation and validating claims. In this paper, we design a process to reliably detect logical fallacies by translating natural language to First-order Logic (FOL) step-by-step using Large Language Models (LLMs). We then utilize Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to reason about the validity of the formula and classify inputs as either a fallacy or valid statement. Our model also provides a novel means of utilizing LLMs to interpret the output of the SMT solver, offering insights into the counter-examples that illustrate why a given sentence is considered a logical fallacy. Our approach is robust, interpretable and does not require training data or fine-tuning. We evaluate our model on a mixed dataset of fallacies and valid sentences. The results demonstrate improved performance compared to end-to-end LLMs, with our classifier achieving an F1-score of 71\% on the Logic dataset. The approach is able to generalize effectively, achieving an F1-score of 73% on the challenge set, LogicClimate, outperforming state-of-the-art models by 21% despite its much smaller size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02318v1,2024-04
Sharing Parameter by Conjugation for Knowledge Graph Embeddings in Complex Space,"Xincan Feng, Zhi Qu, Yuchang Cheng, Taro Watanabe, Nobuhiro Yugami","A Knowledge Graph (KG) is the directed graphical representation of entities and relations in the real world. KG can be applied in diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks where knowledge is required. The need to scale up and complete KG automatically yields Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), a shallow machine learning model that is suffering from memory and training time consumption issues. To mitigate the computational load, we propose a parameter-sharing method, i.e., using conjugate parameters for complex numbers employed in KGE models. Our method improves memory efficiency by 2x in relation embedding while achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art non-conjugate models, with faster, or at least comparable, training time. We demonstrated the generalizability of our method on two best-performing KGE models $5^{\bigstar}\mathrm{E}$ and $\mathrm{ComplEx}$ on five benchmark datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11809v1,2024-04
Enhancing Argument Summarization: Prioritizing Exhaustiveness in Key Point Generation and Introducing an Automatic Coverage Evaluation Metric,"Mohammad Khosravani, Chenyang Huang, Amine Trabelsi","The proliferation of social media platforms has given rise to the amount of online debates and arguments. Consequently, the need for automatic summarization methods for such debates is imperative, however this area of summarization is rather understudied. The Key Point Analysis (KPA) task formulates argument summarization as representing the summary of a large collection of arguments in the form of concise sentences in bullet-style format, called key points. A sub-task of KPA, called Key Point Generation (KPG), focuses on generating these key points given the arguments. This paper introduces a novel extractive approach for key point generation, that outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for the task. Our method utilizes an extractive clustering based approach that offers concise, high quality generated key points with higher coverage of reference summaries, and less redundant outputs. In addition, we show that the existing evaluation metrics for summarization such as ROUGE are incapable of differentiating between generated key points of different qualities. To this end, we propose a new evaluation metric for assessing the generated key points by their coverage. Our code can be accessed online.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11793v1,2024-04
REQUAL-LM: Reliability and Equity through Aggregation in Large Language Models,"Sana Ebrahimi, Nima Shahbazi, Abolfazl Asudeh","The extensive scope of large language models (LLMs) across various domains underscores the critical importance of responsibility in their application, beyond natural language processing. In particular, the randomized nature of LLMs, coupled with inherent biases and historical stereotypes in data, raises critical concerns regarding reliability and equity. Addressing these challenges are necessary before using LLMs for applications with societal impact. Towards addressing this gap, we introduce REQUAL-LM, a novel method for finding reliable and equitable LLM outputs through aggregation. Specifically, we develop a Monte Carlo method based on repeated sampling to find a reliable output close to the mean of the underlying distribution of possible outputs. We formally define the terms such as reliability and bias, and design an equity-aware aggregation to minimize harmful bias while finding a highly reliable output. REQUAL-LM does not require specialized hardware, does not impose a significant computing load, and uses LLMs as a blackbox. This design choice enables seamless scalability alongside the rapid advancement of LLM technologies. Our system does not require retraining the LLMs, which makes it deployment ready and easy to adapt. Our comprehensive experiments using various tasks and datasets demonstrate that REQUAL- LM effectively mitigates bias and selects a more equitable response, specifically the outputs that properly represents minority groups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11782v1,2024-04
Language Models Still Struggle to Zero-shot Reason about Time Series,"Mike A. Merrill, Mingtian Tan, Vinayak Gupta, Tom Hartvigsen, Tim Althoff","Time series are critical for decision-making in fields like finance and healthcare. Their importance has driven a recent influx of works passing time series into language models, leading to non-trivial forecasting on some datasets. But it remains unknown whether non-trivial forecasting implies that language models can reason about time series. To address this gap, we generate a first-of-its-kind evaluation framework for time series reasoning, including formal tasks and a corresponding dataset of multi-scale time series paired with text captions across ten domains. Using these data, we probe whether language models achieve three forms of reasoning: (1) Etiological Reasoning - given an input time series, can the language model identify the scenario that most likely created it? (2) Question Answering - can a language model answer factual questions about time series? (3) Context-Aided Forecasting - does highly relevant textual context improve a language model's time series forecasts?   We find that otherwise highly-capable language models demonstrate surprisingly limited time series reasoning: they score marginally above random on etiological and question answering tasks (up to 30 percentage points worse than humans) and show modest success in using context to improve forecasting. These weakness showcase that time series reasoning is an impactful, yet deeply underdeveloped direction for language model research. We also make our datasets and code public at to support further research in this direction at https://github.com/behavioral-data/TSandLanguage",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11757v1,2024-04

These societies exhibit a phenomenon characterized by strong bonds within their own groups and animosity towards others, leading to conflicts that frequently escalate into violent confrontations. To address this issue, we have developed the first comprehensive framework for the automatic detection of communal violence markers in online Bangla content accompanying the largest collection (13K raw sentences) of social media interactions that fall under the definition of four major violence class and their 16 coarse expressions. Our workflow introduces a 7-step expert annotation process incorporating insights from social scientists, linguists, and psychologists. By presenting data statistics and benchmarking performance using this dataset, we have determined that, aside from the category of Non-communal violence, Religio-communal violence is particularly pervasive in Bangla text. Moreover, we have substantiated the effectiveness of fine-tuning language models in identifying violent comments by conducting preliminary benchmarking on the state-of-the-art Bangla deep learning model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11752v1,2024-04
Missed Connections: Lateral Thinking Puzzles for Large Language Models,"Graham Todd, Tim Merino, Sam Earle, Julian Togelius","The Connections puzzle published each day by the New York Times tasks players with dividing a bank of sixteen words into four groups of four words that each relate to a common theme. Solving the puzzle requires both common linguistic knowledge (i.e. definitions and typical usage) as well as, in many cases, lateral or abstract thinking. This is because the four categories ascend in complexity, with the most challenging category often requiring thinking about words in uncommon ways or as parts of larger phrases. We investigate the capacity for automated AI systems to play Connections and explore the game's potential as an automated benchmark for abstract reasoning and a way to measure the semantic information encoded by data-driven linguistic systems. In particular, we study both a sentence-embedding baseline and modern large language models (LLMs). We report their accuracy on the task, measure the impacts of chain-of-thought prompting, and discuss their failure modes. Overall, we find that the Connections task is challenging yet feasible, and a strong test-bed for future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11730v2,2024-04
Investigating Gender Bias in Turkish Language Models,"Orhun Caglidil, Malte Ostendorff, Georg Rehm","Language models are trained mostly on Web data, which often contains social stereotypes and biases that the models can inherit. This has potentially negative consequences, as models can amplify these biases in downstream tasks or applications. However, prior research has primarily focused on the English language, especially in the context of gender bias. In particular, grammatically gender-neutral languages such as Turkish are underexplored despite representing different linguistic properties to language models with possibly different effects on biases. In this paper, we fill this research gap and investigate the significance of gender bias in Turkish language models. We build upon existing bias evaluation frameworks and extend them to the Turkish language by translating existing English tests and creating new ones designed to measure gender bias in the context of T\""urkiye. Specifically, we also evaluate Turkish language models for their embedded ethnic bias toward Kurdish people. Based on the experimental results, we attribute possible biases to different model characteristics such as the model size, their multilingualism, and the training corpora. We make the Turkish gender bias dataset publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11726v1,2024-04
How often are errors in natural language reasoning due to paraphrastic variability?,"Neha Srikanth, Marine Carpuat, Rachel Rudinger","Large language models have been shown to behave inconsistently in response to meaning-preserving paraphrastic inputs. At the same time, researchers evaluate the knowledge and reasoning abilities of these models with test evaluations that do not disaggregate the effect of paraphrastic variability on performance. We propose a metric for evaluating the paraphrastic consistency of natural language reasoning models based on the probability of a model achieving the same correctness on two paraphrases of the same problem. We mathematically connect this metric to the proportion of a model's variance in correctness attributable to paraphrasing. To estimate paraphrastic consistency, we collect ParaNLU, a dataset of 7,782 human-written and validated paraphrased reasoning problems constructed on top of existing benchmark datasets for defeasible and abductive natural language inference. Using ParaNLU, we measure the paraphrastic consistency of several model classes and show that consistency dramatically increases with pretraining but not finetuning. All models tested exhibited room for improvement in paraphrastic consistency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11717v1,2024-04

Our work seeks to alleviate this issue by developing language models that provide automated, accessible summaries and scores for such documents, aiming to enhance user understanding and facilitate informed decisions. We compared transformer-based and conventional models during training on our dataset, and RoBERTa performed better overall with a remarkable 0.74 F1-score. Leveraging our best-performing model, RoBERTa, we highlighted redundancies and potential guideline violations by identifying overlaps in GDPR-required documents, underscoring the necessity for stricter GDPR compliance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13087v1,2024-04
Improvement in Semantic Address Matching using Natural Language Processing,"Vansh Gupta, Mohit Gupta, Jai Garg, Nitesh Garg","Address matching is an important task for many businesses especially delivery and take out companies which help them to take out a certain address from their data warehouse. Existing solution uses similarity of strings, and edit distance algorithms to find out the similar addresses from the address database, but these algorithms could not work effectively with redundant, unstructured, or incomplete address data. This paper discuss semantic Address matching technique, by which we can find out a particular address from a list of possible addresses. We have also reviewed existing practices and their shortcoming. Semantic address matching is an essentially NLP task in the field of deep learning. Through this technique We have the ability to triumph the drawbacks of existing methods like redundant or abbreviated data problems. The solution uses the OCR on invoices to extract the address and create the data pool of addresses. Then this data is fed to the algorithm BM-25 for scoring the best matching entries. Then to observe the best result, this will pass through BERT for giving the best possible result from the similar queries.

How Well Can You Articulate that Idea? Insights from Automated Formative Assessment,"Mahsa Sheikhi Karizaki, Dana Gnesdilow, Sadhana Puntambekar, Rebecca J. Passonneau","Automated methods are becoming increasingly integrated into studies of formative feedback on students' science explanation writing. Most of this work, however, addresses students' responses to short answer questions. We investigate automated feedback on students' science explanation essays, where students must articulate multiple ideas. Feedback is based on a rubric that identifies the main ideas students are prompted to include in explanatory essays about the physics of energy and mass, given their experiments with a simulated roller coaster. We have found that students generally improve on revised versions of their essays. Here, however, we focus on two factors that affect the accuracy of the automated feedback. First, we find that the main ideas in the rubric differ with respect to how much freedom they afford in explanations of the idea, thus explanation of a natural law is relatively constrained. Students have more freedom in how they explain complex relations they observe in their roller coasters, such as transfer of different forms of energy. Second, by tracing the automated decision process, we can diagnose when a student's statement lacks sufficient clarity for the automated tool to associate it more strongly with one of the main ideas above all others. This in turn provides an opportunity for teachers and peers to help students reflect on how to state their ideas more clearly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11682v1,2024-04
MemLLM: Finetuning LLMs to Use An Explicit Read-Write Memory,"Ali Modarressi, Abdullatif Köksal, Ayyoob Imani, Mohsen Fayyaz, Hinrich Schütze","While current large language models (LLMs) perform well on many knowledge-related tasks, they are limited by relying on their parameters as an implicit storage mechanism. As a result, they struggle with memorizing rare events and with updating their memory as facts change over time. In addition, the uninterpretable nature of parametric memory makes it challenging to prevent hallucination. Model editing and augmenting LLMs with parameters specialized for memory are only partial solutions. In this paper, we introduce MemLLM, a novel method of enhancing LLMs by integrating a structured and explicit read-and-write memory module. MemLLM tackles the aforementioned challenges by enabling dynamic interaction with the memory and improving the LLM's capabilities in using stored knowledge. Our experiments indicate that MemLLM enhances the LLM's performance and interpretability, in language modeling in general and knowledge-intensive tasks in particular. We see MemLLM as an important step towards making LLMs more grounded and factual through memory augmentation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11672v2,2024-04

The primary objectives of this work are to a) communicate the current capabilities and limitations of existing AI agent implementations, b) share insights gained from our observations of these systems in action, and c) suggest important considerations for future developments in AI agent design. We achieve this by providing overviews of single-agent and multi-agent architectures, identifying key patterns and divergences in design choices, and evaluating their overall impact on accomplishing a provided goal.

Language Ranker: A Metric for Quantifying LLM Performance Across High and Low-Resource Languages,"Zihao Li, Yucheng Shi, Zirui Liu, Fan Yang, Ali Payani, Ninghao Liu, Mengnan Du","The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on extensive text corpora, which are often unevenly distributed across languages. This imbalance results in LLMs performing significantly better on high-resource languages like English, German, and French, while their capabilities in low-resource languages remain inadequate. Currently, there is a lack of quantitative methods to evaluate the performance of LLMs in these low-resource languages. To address this gap, we propose the Language Ranker, an intrinsic metric designed to benchmark and rank languages based on LLM performance using internal representations. By comparing the LLM's internal representation of various languages against a baseline derived from English, we can assess the model's multilingual capabilities in a robust and language-agnostic manner. Our analysis reveals that high-resource languages exhibit higher similarity scores with English, demonstrating superior performance, while low-resource languages show lower similarity scores, underscoring the effectiveness of our metric in assessing language-specific capabilities. Besides, the experiments show that there is a strong correlation between the LLM's performance in different languages and the proportion of those languages in its pre-training corpus. These insights underscore the efficacy of the Language Ranker as a tool for evaluating LLM performance across different languages, particularly those with limited resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11553v3,2024-04
Evaluating Span Extraction in Generative Paradigm: A Reflection on Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Soyoung Yang, Won Ik Cho","In the era of rapid evolution of generative language models within the realm of natural language processing, there is an imperative call to revisit and reformulate evaluation methodologies, especially in the domain of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). This paper addresses the emerging challenges introduced by the generative paradigm, which has moderately blurred traditional boundaries between understanding and generation tasks. Building upon prevailing practices in the field, we analyze the advantages and shortcomings associated with the prevalent ABSA evaluation paradigms. Through an in-depth examination, supplemented by illustrative examples, we highlight the intricacies involved in aligning generative outputs with other evaluative metrics, specifically those derived from other tasks, including question answering. While we steer clear of advocating for a singular and definitive metric, our contribution lies in paving the path for a comprehensive guideline tailored for ABSA evaluations in this generative paradigm. In this position paper, we aim to provide practitioners with profound reflections, offering insights and directions that can aid in navigating this evolving landscape, ensuring evaluations that are both accurate and reflective of generative capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11539v1,2024-04
GenFighter: A Generative and Evolutive Textual Attack Removal,"Md Athikul Islam, Edoardo Serra, Sushil Jajodia","Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges to deep neural networks (DNNs) such as Transformer models in natural language processing (NLP). This paper introduces a novel defense strategy, called GenFighter, which enhances adversarial robustness by learning and reasoning on the training classification distribution. GenFighter identifies potentially malicious instances deviating from the distribution, transforms them into semantically equivalent instances aligned with the training data, and employs ensemble techniques for a unified and robust response. By conducting extensive experiments, we show that GenFighter outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in accuracy under attack and attack success rate metrics. Additionally, it requires a high number of queries per attack, making the attack more challenging in real scenarios. The ablation study shows that our approach integrates transfer learning, a generative/evolutive procedure, and an ensemble method, providing an effective defense against NLP adversarial attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11538v1,2024-04
Select and Reorder: A Novel Approach for Neural Sign Language Production,"Harry Walsh, Ben Saunders, Richard Bowden","Sign languages, often categorised as low-resource languages, face significant challenges in achieving accurate translation due to the scarcity of parallel annotated datasets. This paper introduces Select and Reorder (S&R), a novel approach that addresses data scarcity by breaking down the translation process into two distinct steps: Gloss Selection (GS) and Gloss Reordering (GR). Our method leverages large spoken language models and the substantial lexical overlap between source spoken languages and target sign languages to establish an initial alignment. Both steps make use of Non-AutoRegressive (NAR) decoding for reduced computation and faster inference speeds. Through this disentanglement of tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art BLEU and Rouge scores on the Meine DGS Annotated (mDGS) dataset, demonstrating a substantial BLUE-1 improvement of 37.88% in Text to Gloss (T2G) Translation. This innovative approach paves the way for more effective translation models for sign languages, even in resource-constrained settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11532v1,2024-04
Pack of LLMs: Model Fusion at Test-Time via Perplexity Optimization,"Costas Mavromatis, Petros Karypis, George Karypis","Fusing knowledge from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) can combine their diverse strengths to achieve improved performance on a given task. However, current fusion approaches either rely on learning-based fusers that do not generalize to new LLMs, or do not take into account how well each LLM understands the input. In this work, we study LLM fusion at test-time, which enables leveraging knowledge from arbitrary user-specified LLMs during inference. We introduce Pack of LLMs (PackLLM), an effective method for test-time fusion that leverages each LLM's expertise, given an input prompt. PackLLM performs model fusion by solving an optimization problem for determining each LLM's importance, so that perplexity over the input prompt is minimized. First, our simple PackLLM-sim variant validates that perplexity is a good indicator for measuring each LLM's expertise. Second, our PackLLM-opt variant approximately solves the perplexity minimization problem via a greedy algorithm. The derived importance weights are used to combine the LLMs during inference. We conduct experiments with over 100 total LLMs on a diverse set of tasks. Experimental results show that (i) perplexity is a reliable measure for LLM fusion, (ii) PackLLM outperforms test-time fusion baselines by 1.89% accuracy points, and (iii) PackLLM can leverage new LLMs to improve performance over learning-based fusion approaches by 3.92-11.94% accuracy points.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11531v1,2024-04
Towards Coarse-to-Fine Evaluation of Inference Efficiency for Large Language Models,"Yushuo Chen, Tianyi Tang, Erge Xiang, Linjiang Li, Wayne Xin Zhao, Jing Wang, Yunpeng Chai, Ji-Rong Wen","In real world, large language models (LLMs) can serve as the assistant to help users accomplish their jobs, and also support the development of advanced applications. For the wide application of LLMs, the inference efficiency is an essential concern, which has been widely studied in existing work, and numerous optimization algorithms and code libraries have been proposed to improve it. Nonetheless, users still find it challenging to compare the effectiveness of all the above methods and understand the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we perform a detailed coarse-to-fine analysis of the inference performance of various code libraries. To evaluate the overall effectiveness, we examine four usage scenarios within two practical applications. We further provide both theoretical and empirical fine-grained analyses of each module in the Transformer architecture. Our experiments yield comprehensive results that are invaluable for researchers to evaluate code libraries and improve inference strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11502v1,2024-04
Paraphrase and Solve: Exploring and Exploiting the Impact of Surface Form on Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Yue Zhou, Yada Zhu, Diego Antognini, Yoon Kim, Yang Zhang","This paper studies the relationship between the surface form of a mathematical problem and its solvability by large language models. We find that subtle alterations in the surface form can significantly impact the answer distribution and the solve rate, exposing the language model's lack of robustness and sensitivity to the surface form in reasoning through complex problems. To improve mathematical reasoning performance, we propose Self-Consistency-over-Paraphrases (SCoP), which diversifies reasoning paths from specific surface forms of the problem. We evaluate our approach on four mathematics reasoning benchmarks over three large language models and show that SCoP improves mathematical reasoning performance over vanilla self-consistency, particularly for problems initially deemed unsolvable. Finally, we provide additional experiments and discussion regarding problem difficulty and surface forms, including cross-model difficulty agreement and paraphrasing transferability, and Variance of Variations (VOV) for language model evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11500v1,2024-04
A Data-Driven Representation for Sign Language Production,"Harry Walsh, Abolfazl Ravanshad, Mariam Rahmani, Richard Bowden","Phonetic representations are used when recording spoken languages, but no equivalent exists for recording signed languages. As a result, linguists have proposed several annotation systems that operate on the gloss or sub-unit level; however, these resources are notably irregular and scarce.   Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to automatically translate spoken language sentences into continuous sequences of sign language. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on scarce linguistic resources to work. This has limited progress in the field. This paper introduces an innovative solution by transforming the continuous pose generation problem into a discrete sequence generation problem. Thus, overcoming the need for costly annotation. Although, if available, we leverage the additional information to enhance our approach.   By applying Vector Quantisation (VQ) to sign language data, we first learn a codebook of short motions that can be combined to create a natural sequence of sign. Where each token in the codebook can be thought of as the lexicon of our representation. Then using a transformer we perform a translation from spoken language text to a sequence of codebook tokens. Each token can be directly mapped to a sequence of poses allowing the translation to be performed by a single network. Furthermore, we present a sign stitching method to effectively join tokens together. We evaluate on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) and the more challenging Meine DGS Annotated (mDGS) datasets. An extensive evaluation shows our approach outperforms previous methods, increasing the BLEU-1 back translation score by up to 72%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11499v1,2024-04
A Federated Learning Approach to Privacy Preserving Offensive Language Identification,"Marcos Zampieri, Damith Premasiri, Tharindu Ranasinghe","The spread of various forms of offensive speech online is an important concern in social media. While platforms have been investing heavily in ways of coping with this problem, the question of privacy remains largely unaddressed. Models trained to detect offensive language on social media are trained and/or fine-tuned using large amounts of data often stored in centralized servers. Since most social media data originates from end users, we propose a privacy preserving decentralized architecture for identifying offensive language online by introducing Federated Learning (FL) in the context of offensive language identification. FL is a decentralized architecture that allows multiple models to be trained locally without the need for data sharing hence preserving users' privacy. We propose a model fusion approach to perform FL. We trained multiple deep learning models on four publicly available English benchmark datasets (AHSD, HASOC, HateXplain, OLID) and evaluated their performance in detail. We also present initial cross-lingual experiments in English and Spanish. We show that the proposed model fusion approach outperforms baselines in all the datasets while preserving privacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11470v1,2024-04
Octopus v3: Technical Report for On-device Sub-billion Multimodal AI Agent,"Wei Chen, Zhiyuan Li","A multimodal AI agent is characterized by its ability to process and learn from various types of data, including natural language, visual, and audio inputs, to inform its actions. Despite advancements in large language models that incorporate visual data, such as GPT-4V, effectively translating image-based data into actionable outcomes for AI agents continues to be challenging. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal model that incorporates the concept of functional token specifically designed for AI agent applications. To ensure compatibility with edge devices, our model is optimized to a compact size of less than 1B parameters. Like GPT-4, our model can process both English and Chinese. We demonstrate that this model is capable of operating efficiently on a wide range of edge devices, including as constrained as a Raspberry Pi.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11459v2,2024-04
Bias and Unfairness in Information Retrieval Systems: New Challenges in the LLM Era,"Sunhao Dai, Chen Xu, Shicheng Xu, Liang Pang, Zhenhua Dong, Jun Xu","With the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs), information retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines and recommender systems, have undergone a significant paradigm shift. This evolution, while heralding new opportunities, introduces emerging challenges, particularly in terms of biases and unfairness, which may threaten the information ecosystem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works on emerging and pressing bias and unfairness issues in IR systems when the integration of LLMs. We first unify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing a groundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distribution alignment. Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias and unfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration into IR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. In doing so, we meticulously review and analyze recent literature, focusing on the definitions, characteristics, and corresponding mitigation strategies associated with these issues. Finally, we identify and highlight some open problems and challenges for future work, aiming to inspire researchers and stakeholders in the IR field and beyond to better understand and mitigate bias and unfairness issues of IR in this LLM era. We also consistently maintain a GitHub repository for the relevant papers and resources in this rising direction at https://github.com/KID-22/LLM-IR-Bias-Fairness-Survey.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11457v2,2024-04
AI-Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Deep Learning and Large Language Models for Extracting Cognitive Pathways from Social Media Texts,"Meng Jiang, Yi Jing Yu, Qing Zhao, Jianqiang Li, Changwei Song, Hongzhi Qi, Wei Zhai, Dan Luo, Xiaoqin Wang, Guanghui Fu, Bing Xiang Yang","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective technique for addressing the irrational thoughts stemming from mental illnesses, but it necessitates precise identification of cognitive pathways to be successfully implemented in patient care. In current society, individuals frequently express negative emotions on social media on specific topics, often exhibiting cognitive distortions, including suicidal behaviors in extreme cases. Yet, there is a notable absence of methodologies for analyzing cognitive pathways that could aid psychotherapists in conducting effective interventions online. In this study, we gathered data from social media and established the task of extracting cognitive pathways, annotating the data based on a cognitive theoretical framework. We initially categorized the task of extracting cognitive pathways as a hierarchical text classification with four main categories and nineteen subcategories. Following this, we structured a text summarization task to help psychotherapists quickly grasp the essential information. Our experiments evaluate the performance of deep learning and large language models (LLMs) on these tasks. The results demonstrate that our deep learning method achieved a micro-F1 score of 62.34% in the hierarchical text classification task. Meanwhile, in the text summarization task, GPT-4 attained a Rouge-1 score of 54.92 and a Rouge-2 score of 30.86, surpassing the experimental deep learning model's performance. However, it may suffer from an issue of hallucination. We have made all models and codes publicly available to support further research in this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11449v1,2024-04
Research on emotionally intelligent dialogue generation based on automatic dialogue system,"Jin Wang, JinFei Wang, Shuying Dai, Jiqiang Yu, Keqin Li","Automated dialogue systems are important applications of artificial intelligence, and traditional systems struggle to understand user emotions and provide empathetic feedback. This study integrates emotional intelligence technology into automated dialogue systems and creates a dialogue generation model with emotional intelligence through deep learning and natural language processing techniques. The model can detect and understand a wide range of emotions and specific pain signals in real time, enabling the system to provide empathetic interaction. By integrating the results of the study ""Can artificial intelligence detect pain and express pain empathy?"", the model's ability to understand the subtle elements of pain empathy has been enhanced, setting higher standards for emotional intelligence dialogue systems.

Open-Ended Wargames with Large Language Models,"Daniel P. Hogan, Andrea Brennen","Wargames are a powerful tool for understanding and rehearsing real-world decision making. Automated play of wargames using artificial intelligence (AI) enables possibilities beyond those of human-conducted games, such as playing the game many times over to see a range of possible outcomes. There are two categories of wargames: quantitative games, with discrete types of moves, and qualitative games, which revolve around open-ended responses. Historically, automation efforts have focused on quantitative games, but large language models (LLMs) make it possible to automate qualitative wargames. We introduce ""Snow Globe,"" an LLM-powered multi-agent system for playing qualitative wargames. With Snow Globe, every stage of a text-based qualitative wargame from scenario preparation to post-game analysis can be optionally carried out by AI, humans, or a combination thereof. We describe its software architecture conceptually and release an open-source implementation alongside this publication. As case studies, we simulate a tabletop exercise about an AI incident response and a political wargame about a geopolitical crisis. We discuss potential applications of the approach and how it fits into the broader wargaming ecosystem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11446v1,2024-04
Exploring Key Point Analysis with Pairwise Generation and Graph Partitioning,"Xiao Li, Yong Jiang, Shen Huang, Pengjun Xie, Gong Cheng, Fei Huang","Key Point Analysis (KPA), the summarization of multiple arguments into a concise collection of key points, continues to be a significant and unresolved issue within the field of argument mining. Existing models adapt a two-stage pipeline of clustering arguments or generating key points for argument clusters. This approach rely on semantic similarity instead of measuring the existence of shared key points among arguments. Additionally, it only models the intra-cluster relationship among arguments, disregarding the inter-cluster relationship between arguments that do not share key points. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for KPA with pairwise generation and graph partitioning. Our objective is to train a generative model that can simultaneously provide a score indicating the presence of shared key point between a pair of arguments and generate the shared key point. Subsequently, to map generated redundant key points to a concise set of key points, we proceed to construct an arguments graph by considering the arguments as vertices, the generated key points as edges, and the scores as edge weights. We then propose a graph partitioning algorithm to partition all arguments sharing the same key points to the same subgraph. Notably, our experimental findings demonstrate that our proposed model surpasses previous models when evaluated on both the ArgKP and QAM datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11384v1,2024-04
TeClass: A Human-Annotated Relevance-based Headline Classification and Generation Dataset for Telugu,"Gopichand Kanumolu, Lokesh Madasu, Nirmal Surange, Manish Shrivastava","News headline generation is a crucial task in increasing productivity for both the readers and producers of news. This task can easily be aided by automated News headline-generation models. However, the presence of irrelevant headlines in scraped news articles results in sub-optimal performance of generation models. We propose that relevance-based headline classification can greatly aid the task of generating relevant headlines. Relevance-based headline classification involves categorizing news headlines based on their relevance to the corresponding news articles. While this task is well-established in English, it remains under-explored in low-resource languages like Telugu due to a lack of annotated data. To address this gap, we present TeClass, the first-ever human-annotated Telugu news headline classification dataset, containing 78,534 annotations across 26,178 article-headline pairs. We experiment with various baseline models and provide a comprehensive analysis of their results. We further demonstrate the impact of this work by fine-tuning various headline generation models using TeClass dataset. The headlines generated by the models fine-tuned on highly relevant article-headline pairs, showed about a 5 point increment in the ROUGE-L scores. To encourage future research, the annotated dataset as well as the annotation guidelines will be made publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11349v1,2024-04
To Drop or Not to Drop? Predicting Argument Ellipsis Judgments: A Case Study in Japanese,"Yukiko Ishizuki, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Yuichiroh Matsubayashi, Ryohei Sasano, Kentaro Inui","Speakers sometimes omit certain arguments of a predicate in a sentence; such omission is especially frequent in pro-drop languages. This study addresses a question about ellipsis -- what can explain the native speakers' ellipsis decisions? -- motivated by the interest in human discourse processing and writing assistance for this choice. To this end, we first collect large-scale human annotations of whether and why a particular argument should be omitted across over 2,000 data points in the balanced corpus of Japanese, a prototypical pro-drop language. The data indicate that native speakers overall share common criteria for such judgments and further clarify their quantitative characteristics, e.g., the distribution of related linguistic factors in the balanced corpus. Furthermore, the performance of the language model-based argument ellipsis judgment model is examined, and the gap between the systems' prediction and human judgments in specific linguistic aspects is revealed. We hope our fundamental resource encourages further studies on natural human ellipsis judgment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11315v2,2024-04
A Preference-driven Paradigm for Enhanced Translation with Large Language Models,"Dawei Zhu, Sony Trenous, Xiaoyu Shen, Dietrich Klakow, Bill Byrne, Eva Hasler","Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can achieve remarkable translation performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using only a small amount of parallel data. However, SFT simply instructs the model to imitate the reference translations at the token level, making it vulnerable to the noise present in the references. Hence, the assistance from SFT often reaches a plateau once the LLMs have achieved a certain level of translation capability, and further increasing the size of parallel data does not provide additional benefits. To overcome this plateau associated with imitation-based SFT, we propose a preference-based approach built upon the Plackett-Luce model. The objective is to steer LLMs towards a more nuanced understanding of translation preferences from a holistic view, while also being more resilient in the absence of gold translations. We further build a dataset named MAPLE to verify the effectiveness of our approach, which includes multiple translations of varying quality for each source sentence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in ""breaking the plateau"" across diverse LLMs and test settings. Our in-depth analysis underscores the pivotal role of diverse translations and accurate preference scores in the success of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11288v2,2024-04
Sampling-based Pseudo-Likelihood for Membership Inference Attacks,"Masahiro Kaneko, Youmi Ma, Yuki Wata, Naoaki Okazaki","Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on large-scale web data, which makes it difficult to grasp the contribution of each text. This poses the risk of leaking inappropriate data such as benchmarks, personal information, and copyrighted texts in the training data. Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), which determine whether a given text is included in the model's training data, have been attracting attention. Previous studies of MIAs revealed that likelihood-based classification is effective for detecting leaks in LLMs. However, the existing methods cannot be applied to some proprietary models like ChatGPT or Claude 3 because the likelihood is unavailable to the user. In this study, we propose a Sampling-based Pseudo-Likelihood (\textbf{SPL}) method for MIA (\textbf{SaMIA}) that calculates SPL using only the text generated by an LLM to detect leaks. The SaMIA treats the target text as the reference text and multiple outputs from the LLM as text samples, calculates the degree of $n$-gram match as SPL, and determines the membership of the text in the training data. Even without likelihoods, SaMIA performed on par with existing likelihood-based methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11262v1,2024-04
In-Context Learning State Vector with Inner and Momentum Optimization,"Dongfang Li, Zhenyu Liu, Xinshuo Hu, Zetian Sun, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited an impressive ability to perform In-Context Learning (ICL) from only a few examples. Recent works have indicated that the functions learned by ICL can be represented through compressed vectors derived from the transformer. However, the working mechanisms and optimization of these vectors are yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a comprehensive analysis of these compressed vectors, drawing parallels to the parameters trained with gradient descent, and introduce the concept of state vector. Inspired by the works on model soup and momentum-based gradient descent, we propose inner and momentum optimization methods that are applied to refine the state vector progressively as test-time adaptation. Moreover, we simulate state vector aggregation in the multiple example setting, where demonstrations comprising numerous examples are usually too lengthy for regular ICL, and further propose a divide-and-conquer aggregation method to address this challenge. We conduct extensive experiments using Llama-2 and GPT-J in both zero-shot setting and few-shot setting. The experimental results show that our optimization method effectively enhances the state vector and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks.

Position Engineering: Boosting Large Language Models through Positional Information Manipulation,"Zhiyuan He, Huiqiang Jiang, Zilong Wang, Yuqing Yang, Luna Qiu, Lili Qiu","The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly influenced by the quality of the prompts provided. In response, researchers have developed enormous prompt engineering strategies aimed at modifying the prompt text to enhance task performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique termed position engineering, which offers a more efficient way to guide large language models. Unlike prompt engineering, which requires substantial effort to modify the text provided to LLMs, position engineering merely involves altering the positional information in the prompt without modifying the text itself. We have evaluated position engineering in two widely-used LLM scenarios: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL). Our findings show that position engineering substantially improves upon the baseline in both cases. Position engineering thus represents a promising new strategy for exploiting the capabilities of large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11216v2,2024-04
Prompt-tuning for Clickbait Detection via Text Summarization,"Haoxiang Deng, Yi Zhu, Ye Wang, Jipeng Qiang, Yunhao Yuan, Yun Li, Runmei Zhang","Clickbaits are surprising social posts or deceptive news headlines that attempt to lure users for more clicks, which have posted at unprecedented rates for more profit or commercial revenue. The spread of clickbait has significant negative impacts on the users, which brings users misleading or even click-jacking attacks. Different from fake news, the crucial problem in clickbait detection is determining whether the headline matches the corresponding content. Most existing methods compute the semantic similarity between the headlines and contents for detecting clickbait. However, due to significant differences in length and semantic features between headlines and contents, directly calculating semantic similarity is often difficult to summarize the relationship between them. To address this problem, we propose a prompt-tuning method for clickbait detection via text summarization in this paper, text summarization is introduced to summarize the contents, and clickbait detection is performed based on the similarity between the generated summary and the contents. Specifically, we first introduce a two-stage text summarization model to produce high-quality news summaries based on pre-trained language models, and then both the headlines and new generated summaries are incorporated as the inputs for prompt-tuning. Additionally, a variety of strategies are conducted to incorporate external knowledge for improving the performance of clickbait detection. The extensive experiments on well-known clickbait detection datasets demonstrate that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11206v1,2024-04
Pose2Gest: A Few-Shot Model-Free Approach Applied In South Indian Classical Dance Gesture Recognition,"Kavitha Raju, Nandini J. Warrier, Manu Madhavan, Selvi C., Arun B. Warrier, Thulasi Kumar","The classical dances from India utilize a set of hand gestures known as Mudras, serving as the foundational elements of its posture vocabulary. Identifying these mudras represents a primary task in digitizing the dance performances. With Kathakali, a dance-drama, as the focus, this work addresses mudra recognition by framing it as a 24-class classification problem and proposes a novel vector-similarity-based approach leveraging pose estimation techniques. This method obviates the need for extensive training or fine-tuning, thus mitigating the issue of limited data availability common in similar AI applications. Achieving an accuracy rate of 92%, our approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance to existing model-training-based methodologies in this domain. Notably, it remains effective even with small datasets comprising just 1 or 5 samples, albeit with a slightly diminished performance. Furthermore, our system supports processing images, videos, and real-time streams, accommodating both hand-cropped and full-body images. As part of this research, we have curated and released a publicly accessible Hasta Mudra dataset, which applies to multiple South Indian art forms including Kathakali.

Neuron Specialization: Leveraging intrinsic task modularity for multilingual machine translation,"Shaomu Tan, Di Wu, Christof Monz","Training a unified multilingual model promotes knowledge transfer but inevitably introduces negative interference. Language-specific modeling methods show promise in reducing interference. However, they often rely on heuristics to distribute capacity and struggle to foster cross-lingual transfer via isolated modules. In this paper, we explore intrinsic task modularity within multilingual networks and leverage these observations to circumvent interference under multilingual translation. We show that neurons in the feed-forward layers tend to be activated in a language-specific manner. Meanwhile, these specialized neurons exhibit structural overlaps that reflect language proximity, which progress across layers. Based on these findings, we propose Neuron Specialization, an approach that identifies specialized neurons to modularize feed-forward layers and then continuously updates them through sparse networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves consistent performance gains over strong baselines with additional analyses demonstrating reduced interference and increased knowledge transfer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11201v1,2024-04

Simultaneously, a considerable number of novel methods for evaluating factual consistency in abstractive summarization systems has been developed. But these evaluation approaches incorporate substantial limitations, especially on refinement and interpretability. In this work, we propose highly effective and interpretable factual inconsistency detection method metric Factual Inconsistency Detection by Zoom-in Summary and Zoom-out Document for abstractive summarization systems that is based on fine-grained atomic facts decomposition. Moreover, we align atomic facts decomposed from the summary with the source document through adaptive granularity expansion. These atomic facts represent a more fine-grained unit of information, facilitating detailed understanding and interpretability of the summary's factual inconsistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed factual consistency checking system significantly outperforms existing systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11184v3,2024-04
Context-Aware Siamese Networks for Efficient Emotion Recognition in Conversation,"Barbara Gendron, Gaël Guibon","The advent of deep learning models has made a considerable contribution to the achievement of Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC). However, this task still remains an important challenge due to the plurality and subjectivity of human emotions. Previous work on ERC provides predictive models using mostly graph-based conversation representations. In this work, we propose a way to model the conversational context that we incorporate into a metric learning training strategy, with a two-step process. This allows us to perform ERC in a flexible classification scenario and to end up with a lightweight yet efficient model. Using metric learning through a Siamese Network architecture, we achieve 57.71 in macro F1 score for emotion classification in conversation on DailyDialog dataset, which outperforms the related work. This state-of-the-art result is promising regarding the use of metric learning for emotion recognition, yet perfectible compared to the microF1 score obtained.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11141v1,2024-04

However, most of them ignore the code hierarchy, leading to improper code assignments. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework based on associated and hierarchical code description distillation (AHDD) for better code representation learning and avoidance of improper code assignment.we utilize the code description and the hierarchical structure inherent to the ICD codes. Therefore, in this paper, we leverage the code description and the hierarchical structure inherent to the ICD codes. The code description is also applied to aware the attention layer and output layer. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show the superiority of the proposed framework over several state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11132v2,2024-04
What's under the hood: Investigating Automatic Metrics on Meeting Summarization,"Frederic Kirstein, Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp","Meeting summarization has become a critical task considering the increase in online interactions. While new techniques are introduced regularly, their evaluation uses metrics not designed to capture meeting-specific errors, undermining effective evaluation. This paper investigates what the frequently used automatic metrics capture and which errors they mask by correlating automatic metric scores with human evaluations across a broad error taxonomy. We commence with a comprehensive literature review on English meeting summarization to define key challenges like speaker dynamics and contextual turn-taking and error types such as missing information and linguistic inaccuracy, concepts previously loosely defined in the field. We examine the relationship between characteristic challenges and errors by using annotated transcripts and summaries from Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence and autoregressive models from the general summary QMSum dataset. Through experimental validation, we find that different model architectures respond variably to challenges in meeting transcripts, resulting in different pronounced links between challenges and errors. Current default-used metrics struggle to capture observable errors, showing weak to mid-correlations, while a third of the correlations show trends of error masking. Only a subset reacts accurately to specific errors, while most correlations show either unresponsiveness or failure to reflect the error's impact on summary quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11124v2,2024-04
Consistency Training by Synthetic Question Generation for Conversational Question Answering,"Hamed Hematian Hemati, Hamid Beigy","Efficiently modeling historical information is a critical component in addressing user queries within a conversational question-answering (QA) context, as historical context plays a vital role in clarifying the user's questions. However, irrelevant history induces noise in the reasoning process, especially for those questions with a considerable historical context. In our novel model-agnostic approach, referred to as CoTaH (Consistency-Trained augmented History), we augment the historical information with synthetic questions and subsequently employ consistency training to train a model that utilizes both real and augmented historical data to implicitly make the reasoning robust to irrelevant history. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of research using question generation as a form of data augmentation to model conversational QA settings. By citing a common modeling error prevalent in previous research, we introduce a new baseline model and compare our model's performance against it, demonstrating an improvement in results, particularly when dealing with questions that include a substantial amount of historical context.

Inductive-Deductive Strategy Reuse for Multi-Turn Instructional Dialogues,"Jiao Ou, Jiayu Wu, Che Liu, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai","Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human expectations requires high-quality instructional dialogues, which usually require instructions that are diverse and in-depth. Existing methods leverage two LLMs to interact for automatic collection: one simulating a user to pose instructions, and the other acting as a system agent to respond. However, these user simulators struggle to model the rules behind how dialogues can pose different instructions without explicit guidance, resulting in general instructions. In this paper, we propose to explicitly capture the complex rules to help the user simulator pose diverse and in-depth instruction. Specifically, we first induce high-level instruction strategies from various real instruction dialogues serving as rules. Afterward, different possible strategies are applied to the newly given dialogue scenario deductively to pose various instructions. Experimental results show that our method can generate diverse and in-depth instructions. The constructed multi-turn instructional dialogues can outperform competitive baselines on the downstream chat model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11095v2,2024-04
ViLLM-Eval: A Comprehensive Evaluation Suite for Vietnamese Large Language Models,"Trong-Hieu Nguyen, Anh-Cuong Le, Viet-Cuong Nguyen","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates the development of new benchmarks to accurately assess their capabilities. To address this need for Vietnamese, this work aims to introduce ViLLM-Eval, the comprehensive evaluation suite designed to measure the advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of foundation models within a Vietnamese context. ViLLM-Eval consists of multiple-choice questions and predict next word tasks spanning various difficulty levels and diverse disciplines, ranging from humanities to science and engineering. A thorough evaluation of the most advanced LLMs on ViLLM-Eval revealed that even the best performing models have significant room for improvement in understanding and responding to Vietnamese language tasks. ViLLM-Eval is believed to be instrumental in identifying key strengths and weaknesses of foundation models, ultimately promoting their development and enhancing their performance for Vietnamese users. This paper provides a thorough overview of ViLLM-Eval as part of the Vietnamese Large Language Model shared task, held within the 10th International Workshop on Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP 2023).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11086v2,2024-04
Efficient Contextual LLM Cascades through Budget-Constrained Policy Learning,"Xuechen Zhang, Zijian Huang, Ege Onur Taga, Carlee Joe-Wong, Samet Oymak, Jiasi Chen","Recent successes in natural language processing have led to the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) by multiple providers. Each LLM offering has different inference accuracy, monetary cost, and latency, and their accuracy further depends on the exact wording of the question (i.e., the specific prompt). At the same time, users often have a limit on monetary budget and latency to answer all their questions, and they do not know which LLMs to choose for each question to meet their accuracy and long term budget requirements. To navigate this rich design space, we propose TREACLE ($\underline{T}$hrifty $\underline{Rea}$soning via $\underline{C}$ontext-Aware $\underline{L}$LM and Prompt S$\underline{e}$lection), a reinforcement learning policy that jointly selects the model and prompting scheme while respecting the user's monetary cost and latency constraints. TREACLE uses the problem context, including question text embeddings (reflecting the type or difficulty of a query) and the response history (reflecting the consistency of previous responses) to make smart decisions. Our evaluations on standard reasoning datasets (GSM8K, CSQA, and LLC) with various LLMs and prompts show that TREACLE enables cost savings of up to 85% compared to baselines, while maintaining high accuracy. Importantly, it provides the user with the ability to gracefully trade off accuracy for cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13082v2,2024-04
Unified Examination of Entity Linking in Absence of Candidate Sets,"Nicolas Ong, Hassan Shavarani, Anoop Sarkar","Despite remarkable strides made in the development of entity linking systems in recent years, a comprehensive comparative analysis of these systems using a unified framework is notably absent. This paper addresses this oversight by introducing a new black-box benchmark and conducting a comprehensive evaluation of all state-of-the-art entity linking methods. We use an ablation study to investigate the impact of candidate sets on the performance of entity linking. Our findings uncover exactly how much such entity linking systems depend on candidate sets, and how much this limits the general applicability of each system. We present an alternative approach to candidate sets, demonstrating that leveraging the entire in-domain candidate set can serve as a viable substitute for certain models. We show the trade-off between less restrictive candidate sets, increased inference time and memory footprint for some models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11061v1,2024-04
Do LLMs Think Fast and Slow? A Causal Study on Sentiment Analysis,"Zhiheng Lyu, Zhijing Jin, Fernando Gonzalez, Rada Mihalcea, Bernhard Schölkopf, Mrinmaya Sachan","Sentiment analysis (SA) aims to identify the sentiment expressed in a text, such as a product review. Given a review and the sentiment associated with it, this work formulates SA as a combination of two tasks: (1) a causal discovery task that distinguishes whether a review ""primes"" the sentiment (Causal Hypothesis C1), or the sentiment ""primes"" the review (Causal Hypothesis C2); and (2) the traditional prediction task to model the sentiment using the review as input. Using the peak-end rule in psychology, we classify a sample as C1 if its overall sentiment score approximates an average of all the sentence-level sentiments in the review, and C2 if the overall sentiment score approximates an average of the peak and end sentiments. For the prediction task, we use the discovered causal mechanisms behind the samples to improve LLM performance by proposing causal prompts that give the models an inductive bias of the underlying causal graph, leading to substantial improvements by up to 32.13 F1 points on zero-shot five-class SA.

Stepwise Alignment for Constrained Language Model Policy Optimization,"Akifumi Wachi, Thien Q. Tran, Rei Sato, Takumi Tanabe, Youhei Akimoto","Safety and trustworthiness are indispensable requirements for real-world applications of AI systems using large language models (LLMs). This paper formulates human value alignment as an optimization problem of the language model policy to maximize reward under a safety constraint, and then proposes an algorithm, Stepwise Alignment for Constrained Policy Optimization (SACPO). One key idea behind SACPO, supported by theory, is that the optimal policy incorporating reward and safety can be directly obtained from a reward-aligned policy. Building on this key idea, SACPO aligns LLMs step-wise with each metric while leveraging simple yet powerful alignment algorithms such as direct preference optimization (DPO). SACPO offers several advantages, including simplicity, stability, computational efficiency, and flexibility of algorithms and datasets. Under mild assumptions, our theoretical analysis provides the upper bounds on optimality and safety constraint violation. Our experimental results show that SACPO can fine-tune Alpaca-7B better than the state-of-the-art method in terms of both helpfulness and harmlessness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11049v3,2024-04
Offset Unlearning for Large Language Models,"James Y. Huang, Wenxuan Zhou, Fei Wang, Fred Morstatter, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen","Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire knowledge from their training corpora, the memorization of sensitive information in the corpora such as copyrighted, harmful, and private content has led to ethical and legal concerns. In response to these challenges, unlearning has emerged as a potential remedy for LLMs affected by problematic training data. However, previous unlearning techniques are either not applicable to black-box LLMs due to required access to model internal weights, or violate data protection principles by retaining sensitive data for inference-time correction. We propose $\delta$-unlearning, an offset unlearning framework for black-box LLMs. Instead of tuning the black-box LLM itself, $\delta$-unlearning learns the logit offset needed for unlearning by contrasting the logits from a pair of smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that $\delta$-unlearning can effectively unlearn target data while maintaining similar or even stronger performance on general out-of-forget-scope tasks. $\delta$-unlearning also effectively incorporates different unlearning algorithms, making our approach a versatile solution to adapting various existing unlearning algorithms to black-box LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11045v1,2024-04
Cross-Platform Hate Speech Detection with Weakly Supervised Causal Disentanglement,"Paras Sheth, Tharindu Kumarage, Raha Moraffah, Aman Chadha, Huan Liu","Content moderation faces a challenging task as social media's ability to spread hate speech contrasts with its role in promoting global connectivity. With rapidly evolving slang and hate speech, the adaptability of conventional deep learning to the fluid landscape of online dialogue remains limited. In response, causality inspired disentanglement has shown promise by segregating platform specific peculiarities from universal hate indicators. However, its dependency on available ground truth target labels for discerning these nuances faces practical hurdles with the incessant evolution of platforms and the mutable nature of hate speech. Using confidence based reweighting and contrastive regularization, this study presents HATE WATCH, a novel framework of weakly supervised causal disentanglement that circumvents the need for explicit target labeling and effectively disentangles input features into invariant representations of hate. Empirical validation across platforms two with target labels and two without positions HATE WATCH as a novel method in cross platform hate speech detection with superior performance. HATE WATCH advances scalable content moderation techniques towards developing safer online communities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11036v1,2024-04

Natural language processing, in particular, has been prominent in Social-AI research, as language plays a key role in constructing the social world.

Many-Shot In-Context Learning,"Rishabh Agarwal, Avi Singh, Lei M. Zhang, Bernd Bohnet, Luis Rosias, Stephanie Chan, Biao Zhang, Ankesh Anand, Zaheer Abbas, Azade Nova, John D. Co-Reyes, Eric Chu, Feryal Behbahani, Aleksandra Faust, Hugo Larochelle","Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) -- learning from a few examples provided in context at inference, without any weight updates. Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples -- the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated examples. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two new settings: Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL. Reinforced ICL uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human examples. Unsupervised ICL removes rationales from the prompt altogether, and prompts the model only with domain-specific questions. We find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases, can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs, and performs comparably to fine-tuning. We also find that inference cost increases linearly in the many-shot regime, and frontier LLMs benefit from many-shot ICL to varying degrees. Our analysis also reveals the limitations of next-token prediction loss as an indicator of downstream ICL performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11018v3,2024-04
A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation for Large Language Models,"Yizheng Huang, Jimmy Huang","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) merges retrieval methods with deep learning advancements to address the static limitations of large language models (LLMs) by enabling the dynamic integration of up-to-date external information. This methodology, focusing primarily on the text domain, provides a cost-effective solution to the generation of plausible but possibly incorrect responses by LLMs, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of their outputs through the use of real-world data. As RAG grows in complexity and incorporates multiple concepts that can influence its performance, this paper organizes the RAG paradigm into four categories: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation, offering a detailed perspective from the retrieval viewpoint. It outlines RAG's evolution and discusses the field's progression through the analysis of significant studies. Additionally, the paper introduces evaluation methods for RAG, addressing the challenges faced and proposing future research directions. By offering an organized framework and categorization, the study aims to consolidate existing research on RAG, clarify its technological underpinnings, and highlight its potential to broaden the adaptability and applications of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10981v2,2024-04
SuRe: Summarizing Retrievals using Answer Candidates for Open-domain QA of LLMs,"Jaehyung Kim, Jaehyun Nam, Sangwoo Mo, Jongjin Park, Sang-Woo Lee, Minjoon Seo, Jung-Woo Ha, Jinwoo Shin","Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in various natural language processing tasks, including question answering (QA) tasks. While incorporating new information with the retrieval of relevant passages is a promising way to improve QA with LLMs, the existing methods often require additional fine-tuning which becomes infeasible with recent LLMs. Augmenting retrieved passages via prompting has the potential to address this limitation, but this direction has been limitedly explored. To this end, we design a simple yet effective framework to enhance open-domain QA (ODQA) with LLMs, based on the summarized retrieval (SuRe). SuRe helps LLMs predict more accurate answers for a given question, which are well-supported by the summarized retrieval that could be viewed as an explicit rationale extracted from the retrieved passages. Specifically, SuRe first constructs summaries of the retrieved passages for each of the multiple answer candidates. Then, SuRe confirms the most plausible answer from the candidate set by evaluating the validity and ranking of the generated summaries. Experimental results on diverse ODQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SuRe, with improvements of up to 4.6% in exact match (EM) and 4.0% in F1 score over standard prompting approaches. SuRe also can be integrated with a broad range of retrieval methods and LLMs. Finally, the generated summaries from SuRe show additional advantages to measure the importance of retrieved passages and serve as more preferred rationales by models and humans.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13081v1,2024-04
Procedural Dilemma Generation for Evaluating Moral Reasoning in Humans and Language Models,"Jan-Philipp Fränken, Kanishk Gandhi, Tori Qiu, Ayesha Khawaja, Noah D. Goodman, Tobias Gerstenberg","As AI systems like language models are increasingly integrated into decision-making processes affecting people's lives, it's critical to ensure that these systems have sound moral reasoning. To test whether they do, we need to develop systematic evaluations. We provide a framework that uses a language model to translate causal graphs that capture key aspects of moral dilemmas into prompt templates. With this framework, we procedurally generated a large and diverse set of moral dilemmas -- the OffTheRails benchmark -- consisting of 50 scenarios and 400 unique test items. We collected moral permissibility and intention judgments from human participants for a subset of our items and compared these judgments to those from two language models (GPT-4 and Claude-2) across eight conditions. We find that moral dilemmas in which the harm is a necessary means (as compared to a side effect) resulted in lower permissibility and higher intention ratings for both participants and language models. The same pattern was observed for evitable versus inevitable harmful outcomes. However, there was no clear effect of whether the harm resulted from an agent's action versus from having omitted to act. We discuss limitations of our prompt generation pipeline and opportunities for improving scenarios to increase the strength of experimental effects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10975v1,2024-04
Uncertainty-Based Abstention in LLMs Improves Safety and Reduces Hallucinations,"Christian Tomani, Kamalika Chaudhuri, Ivan Evtimov, Daniel Cremers, Mark Ibrahim","A major barrier towards the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) is their lack of reliability. Three situations where this is particularly apparent are correctness, hallucinations when given unanswerable questions, and safety. In all three cases, models should ideally abstain from responding, much like humans, whose ability to understand uncertainty makes us refrain from answering questions we don't know. Inspired by analogous approaches in classification, this study explores the feasibility and efficacy of abstaining while uncertain in the context of LLMs within the domain of question-answering. We investigate two kinds of uncertainties, statistical uncertainty metrics and a distinct verbalized measure, termed as In-Dialogue Uncertainty (InDU). Using these uncertainty measures combined with models with and without Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), we show that in all three situations, abstention based on the right kind of uncertainty measure can boost the reliability of LLMs. By sacrificing only a few highly uncertain samples we can improve correctness by 2% to 8%, avoid 50% hallucinations via correctly identifying unanswerable questions and increase safety by 70% up to 99% with almost no additional computational overhead.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10960v1,2024-04
Can Language Models Solve Olympiad Programming?,"Quan Shi, Michael Tang, Karthik Narasimhan, Shunyu Yao","Computing olympiads contain some of the most challenging problems for humans, requiring complex algorithmic reasoning, puzzle solving, in addition to generating efficient code. However, it has been understudied as a domain to evaluate language models (LMs). In this paper, we introduce the USACO benchmark with 307 problems from the USA Computing Olympiad, along with high-quality unit tests, reference code, and official analyses for each problem. These resources enable us to construct and test a range of LM inference methods for competitive programming for the first time. We find GPT-4 only achieves a 8.7% pass@1 accuracy with zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and our best inference method improves it to 20.2% using a combination of self-reflection and retrieval over episodic knowledge. However, this is far from solving the benchmark. To better understand the remaining challenges, we design a novel human-in-the-loop study and surprisingly find that a small number of targeted hints enable GPT-4 to solve 13 out of 15 problems previously unsolvable by any model and method. Our benchmark, baseline methods, quantitative results, and qualitative analysis serve as an initial step toward LMs with grounded, creative, and algorithmic reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10952v1,2024-04
More Room for Language: Investigating the Effect of Retrieval on Language Models,"David Samuel, Lucas Georges Gabriel Charpentier, Sondre Wold","Retrieval-augmented language models pose a promising alternative to standard language modeling. During pretraining, these models search in a corpus of documents for contextually relevant information that could aid the language modeling objective. We introduce an 'ideal retrieval' methodology to study these models in a fully controllable setting. We conduct an extensive evaluation to examine how retrieval augmentation affects the behavior of the underlying language model. Among other things, we observe that these models: i) save substantially less world knowledge in their weights, ii) are better at understanding local context and inter-word dependencies, but iii) are worse at comprehending global context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10939v1,2024-04

LLMem: Estimating GPU Memory Usage for Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained LLMs,"Taeho Kim, Yanming Wang, Vatshank Chaturvedi, Lokesh Gupta, Seyeon Kim, Yongin Kwon, Sangtae Ha","Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with limited hardware presents challenges due to GPU memory constraints. Various distributed fine-tuning methods have been proposed to alleviate memory constraints on GPU. However, determining the most effective method for achieving rapid fine-tuning while preventing GPU out-of-memory issues in a given environment remains unclear. To address this challenge, we introduce LLMem, a solution that estimates the GPU memory consumption when applying distributed fine-tuning methods across multiple GPUs and identifies the optimal method. We conduct GPU memory usage estimation prior to fine-tuning, leveraging the fundamental structure of transformer-based decoder models and the memory usage distribution of each method. Experimental results show that LLMem accurately estimates peak GPU memory usage on a single GPU, with error rates of up to 1.6%. Additionally, it shows an average error rate of 3.0% when applying distributed fine-tuning methods to LLMs with more than a billion parameters on multi-GPU setups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10933v1,2024-04
Binder: Hierarchical Concept Representation through Order Embedding of Binary Vectors,"Croix Gyurek, Niloy Talukder, Mohammad Al Hasan","For natural language understanding and generation, embedding concepts using an order-based representation is an essential task. Unlike traditional point vector based representation, an order-based representation imposes geometric constraints on the representation vectors for explicitly capturing various semantic relationships that may exist between a pair of concepts. In existing literature, several approaches on order-based embedding have been proposed, mostly focusing on capturing hierarchical relationships; examples include vectors in Euclidean space, complex, Hyperbolic, order, and Box Embedding. Box embedding creates region-based rich representation of concepts, but along the process it sacrifices simplicity, requiring a custom-made optimization scheme for learning the representation. Hyperbolic embedding improves embedding quality by exploiting the ever-expanding property of Hyperbolic space, but it also suffers from the same fate as box embedding as gradient descent like optimization is not simple in the Hyperbolic space. In this work, we propose Binder, a novel approach for order-based representation. Binder uses binary vectors for embedding, so the embedding vectors are compact with an order of magnitude smaller footprint than other methods. Binder uses a simple and efficient optimization scheme for learning representation vectors with a linear time complexity. Our comprehensive experimental results show that Binder is very accurate, yielding competitive results on the representation task. But Binder stands out from its competitors on the transitive closure link prediction task as it can learn concept embeddings just from the direct edges, whereas all existing order-based approaches rely on the indirect edges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10924v1,2024-04
Teaching a Multilingual Large Language Model to Understand Multilingual Speech via Multi-Instructional Training,"Pavel Denisov, Ngoc Thang Vu","Recent advancements in language modeling have led to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of various natural language processing tasks. Despite their success in text-based tasks, applying LLMs to the speech domain remains limited and challenging. This paper presents BLOOMZMMS, a novel model that integrates a multilingual LLM with a multilingual speech encoder, aiming to harness the capabilities of LLMs for speech recognition and beyond. Utilizing a multi-instructional training approach, we demonstrate the transferability of linguistic knowledge from the text to the speech modality. Our experiments, conducted on 1900 hours of transcribed data from 139 languages, establish that a multilingual speech representation can be effectively learned and aligned with a multilingual LLM. While this learned representation initially shows limitations in task generalization, we address this issue by generating synthetic targets in a multi-instructional style. Our zero-shot evaluation results confirm the robustness of our approach across multiple tasks, including speech translation and multilingual spoken language understanding, thereby opening new avenues for applying LLMs in the speech domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10922v1,2024-04
Which questions should I answer? Salience Prediction of Inquisitive Questions,"Yating Wu, Ritika Mangla, Alexandros G. Dimakis, Greg Durrett, Junyi Jessy Li","Inquisitive questions -- open-ended, curiosity-driven questions people ask as they read -- are an integral part of discourse processing (Kehler and Rohde, 2017; Onea, 2016) and comprehension (Prince, 2004). Recent work in NLP has taken advantage of question generation capabilities of LLMs to enhance a wide range of applications. But the space of inquisitive questions is vast: many questions can be evoked from a given context. So which of those should be prioritized to find answers? Linguistic theories, unfortunately, have not yet provided an answer to this question. This paper presents QSALIENCE, a salience predictor of inquisitive questions. QSALIENCE is instruction-tuned over our dataset of linguist-annotated salience scores of 1,766 (context, question) pairs. A question scores high on salience if answering it would greatly enhance the understanding of the text (Van Rooy, 2003). We show that highly salient questions are empirically more likely to be answered in the same article, bridging potential questions (Onea, 2016) with Questions Under Discussion (Roberts, 2012). We further validate our findings by showing that answering salient questions is an indicator of summarization quality in news.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10917v2,2024-04
Search Beyond Queries: Training Smaller Language Models for Web Interactions via Reinforcement Learning,"Moghis Fereidouni, A. B. Siddique","Traditional search systems focus on query formulation for effective results but face challenges in scenarios such as product searches where crucial product details (e.g., size, color) remain concealed until users visit specific product pages. This highlights the need for intelligent web navigation agents capable of formulating queries and navigating web pages according to users' high-level intents. In response to this need, this work introduces a Grounded Language Agent for Intelligent Web Interactions, called GLAINTEL. Drawing upon advancements in language modeling and reinforcement learning, GLAINTEL investigates the efficacy of transformer-based models in enhancing the search capabilities of interactive web environments. Given the dynamic action space for each state in web navigation, GLAINTEL employs the Flan-T5 architecture and incorporates language modeling and value estimation heads. This work focuses on training smaller language models as agents across various scenarios, systematically evaluating the impact of human demonstrations on the training process. Specifically, we investigate scenarios where no human demonstrations are available and subsequently assess the effective utilization of such demonstrations. We also explore unsupervised domain adaptation for situations where demonstrations are confined to a specific domain. Experimental evaluations across diverse setups demonstrate the effectiveness of training agents in unsupervised settings, outperforming in-context learning-based approaches that employ larger models with up to 540 billion parameters. Surprisingly, behavioral cloning-based methods that straightforwardly use human demonstrations do not outperform unsupervised learning-based methods. Additionally, combining human demonstrations with Reinforcement Learning-based training yields results comparable to models utilizing GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10887v1,2024-04
Incubating Text Classifiers Following User Instruction with Nothing but LLM,"Letian Peng, Jingbo Shang","In this paper, we aim to generate text classification data given arbitrary class definitions (i.e., user instruction), so one can train a small text classifier without any human annotation or raw corpus. Compared with pioneer attempts, our proposed Incubator is the first framework that can handle complicated and even mutually dependent classes (e.g., ""TED Talk given by Educator"" and ""Other""). Specifically, Incubator is an LLM firstly tuned on the instruction-to-data mappings that we obtained from classification datasets and descriptions on HuggingFace together with in-context augmentation by GPT-4. We then refine Incubator by learning on the cluster centers of semantic textual embeddings to emphasize the uniformity and semantic diversity in generations. We compare Incubator on various classification tasks with strong baselines such as direct LLM-based inference and training data generation by prompt engineering. Experiments show Incubator is able to (1) perform well on traditional benchmarks, (2) take label dependency and user preference into consideration, and (3) enable logical text mining by incubating multiple classifiers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10877v2,2024-04
Forcing Diffuse Distributions out of Language Models,"Yiming Zhang, Avi Schwarzschild, Nicholas Carlini, Zico Kolter, Daphne Ippolito","Despite being trained specifically to follow user instructions, today's instructiontuned language models perform poorly when instructed to produce random outputs. For example, when prompted to pick a number uniformly between one and ten Llama-2-13B-chat disproportionately favors the number five, and when tasked with picking a first name at random, Mistral-7B-Instruct chooses Avery 40 times more often than we would expect based on the U.S. population. When these language models are used for real-world tasks where diversity of outputs is crucial, such as language model assisted dataset construction, their inability to produce diffuse distributions over valid choices is a major hurdle. In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method that encourages language models to output distributions that are diffuse over valid outcomes. The methods we introduce generalize across a variety of tasks and distributions and make large language models practical for synthetic dataset generation with little human intervention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10859v2,2024-04
D3CODE: Disentangling Disagreements in Data across Cultures on Offensiveness Detection and Evaluation,"Aida Mostafazadeh Davani, Mark Díaz, Dylan Baker, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran","While human annotations play a crucial role in language technologies, annotator subjectivity has long been overlooked in data collection. Recent studies that have critically examined this issue are often situated in the Western context, and solely document differences across age, gender, or racial groups. As a result, NLP research on subjectivity have overlooked the fact that individuals within demographic groups may hold diverse values, which can influence their perceptions beyond their group norms. To effectively incorporate these considerations into NLP pipelines, we need datasets with extensive parallel annotations from various social and cultural groups. In this paper we introduce the \dataset dataset: a large-scale cross-cultural dataset of parallel annotations for offensive language in over 4.5K sentences annotated by a pool of over 4k annotators, balanced across gender and age, from across 21 countries, representing eight geo-cultural regions. The dataset contains annotators' moral values captured along six moral foundations: care, equality, proportionality, authority, loyalty, and purity. Our analyses reveal substantial regional variations in annotators' perceptions that are shaped by individual moral values, offering crucial insights for building pluralistic, culturally sensitive NLP models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10857v1,2024-04
A LayoutLMv3-Based Model for Enhanced Relation Extraction in Visually-Rich Documents,"Wiam Adnan, Joel Tang, Yassine Bel Khayat Zouggari, Seif Edinne Laatiri, Laurent Lam, Fabien Caspani","Document Understanding is an evolving field in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In particular, visual and spatial features are essential in addition to the raw text itself and hence, several multimodal models were developed in the field of Visual Document Understanding (VDU). However, while research is mainly focused on Key Information Extraction (KIE), Relation Extraction (RE) between identified entities is still under-studied. For instance, RE is crucial to regroup entities or obtain a comprehensive hierarchy of data in a document. In this paper, we present a model that, initialized from LayoutLMv3, can match or outperform the current state-of-the-art results in RE applied to Visually-Rich Documents (VRD) on FUNSD and CORD datasets, without any specific pre-training and with fewer parameters. We also report an extensive ablation study performed on FUNSD, highlighting the great impact of certain features and modelization choices on the performances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10848v1,2024-04
Dynamic Self-adaptive Multiscale Distillation from Pre-trained Multimodal Large Model for Efficient Cross-modal Representation Learning,"Zhengyang Liang, Meiyu Liang, Wei Huang, Yawen Li, Zhe Xue","In recent years, pre-trained multimodal large models have attracted widespread attention due to their outstanding performance in various multimodal applications. Nonetheless, the extensive computational resources and vast datasets required for their training present significant hurdles for deployment in environments with limited computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a novel dynamic self-adaptive multiscale distillation from pre-trained multimodal large model for efficient cross-modal representation learning for the first time. Unlike existing distillation methods, our strategy employs a multiscale perspective, enabling the extraction structural knowledge across from the pre-trained multimodal large model. Ensuring that the student model inherits a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the teacher knowledge. To optimize each distillation loss in a balanced and efficient manner, we propose a dynamic self-adaptive distillation loss balancer, a novel component eliminating the need for manual loss weight adjustments and dynamically balances each loss item during the distillation process. Our methodology streamlines pre-trained multimodal large models using only their output features and original image-level information, requiring minimal computational resources. This efficient approach is suited for various applications and allows the deployment of advanced multimodal technologies even in resource-limited settings. Extensive experiments has demonstrated that our method maintains high performance while significantly reducing model complexity and training costs. Moreover, our distilled student model utilizes only image-level information to achieve state-of-the-art performance on cross-modal retrieval tasks, surpassing previous methods that relied on region-level information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10838v1,2024-04
Fewer Truncations Improve Language Modeling,"Hantian Ding, Zijian Wang, Giovanni Paolini, Varun Kumar, Anoop Deoras, Dan Roth, Stefano Soatto","In large language model training, input documents are typically concatenated together and then split into sequences of equal length to avoid padding tokens. Despite its efficiency, the concatenation approach compromises data integrity -- it inevitably breaks many documents into incomplete pieces, leading to excessive truncations that hinder the model from learning to compose logically coherent and factually consistent content that is grounded on the complete context. To address the issue, we propose Best-fit Packing, a scalable and efficient method that packs documents into training sequences through length-aware combinatorial optimization. Our method completely eliminates unnecessary truncations while retaining the same training efficiency as concatenation. Empirical results from both text and code pre-training show that our method achieves superior performance (e.g., relatively +4.7% on reading comprehension; +16.8% in context following; and +9.2% on program synthesis), and reduces closed-domain hallucination effectively by up to 58.3%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10830v2,2024-04
MiniCheck: Efficient Fact-Checking of LLMs on Grounding Documents,"Liyan Tang, Philippe Laban, Greg Durrett","Recognizing if LLM output can be grounded in evidence is central to many tasks in NLP: retrieval-augmented generation, summarization, document-grounded dialogue, and more. Current approaches to this kind of fact-checking are based on verifying each piece of a model generation against potential evidence using an LLM. However, this process can be very computationally expensive, requiring many calls to a model to check a single response. In this work, we show how to build small fact-checking models that have GPT-4-level performance but for 400x lower cost. We do this by constructing synthetic training data with GPT-4, which involves creating realistic yet challenging instances of factual errors via a structured generation procedure. Training on this data teaches models to check each fact in the claim and recognize synthesis of information across sentences. For evaluation, we unify datasets from recent work on fact-checking and grounding LLM generations into a new benchmark, LLM-AggreFact. Our best system MiniCheck-FT5 (770M parameters) outperforms all systems of comparable size and reaches GPT-4 accuracy. We release LLM-AggreFact, code for data synthesis, and models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10774v2,2024-04
LaDiC: Are Diffusion Models Really Inferior to Autoregressive Counterparts for Image-to-Text Generation?,"Yuchi Wang, Shuhuai Ren, Rundong Gao, Linli Yao, Qingyan Guo, Kaikai An, Jianhong Bai, Xu Sun","Diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in text-to-image generation. However, their performance in image-to-text generation, specifically image captioning, has lagged behind Auto-Regressive (AR) models, casting doubt on their applicability for such tasks. In this work, we revisit diffusion models, highlighting their capacity for holistic context modeling and parallel decoding. With these benefits, diffusion models can alleviate the inherent limitations of AR methods, including their slow inference speed, error propagation, and unidirectional constraints. Furthermore, we identify the prior underperformance of diffusion models stemming from the absence of an effective latent space for image-text alignment, and the discrepancy between continuous diffusion processes and discrete textual data. In response, we introduce a novel architecture, LaDiC, which utilizes a split BERT to create a dedicated latent space for captions and integrates a regularization module to manage varying text lengths. Our framework also includes a diffuser for semantic image-to-text conversion and a Back&Refine technique to enhance token interactivity during inference. LaDiC achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffusion-based methods on the MS COCO dataset with 38.2 BLEU@4 and 126.2 CIDEr, demonstrating exceptional performance without pre-training or ancillary modules. This indicates strong competitiveness with AR models, revealing the previously untapped potential of diffusion models in image-to-text generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10763v1,2024-04
Deep Learning and LLM-based Methods Applied to Stellar Lightcurve Classification,"Yu-Yang Li, Yu Bai, Cunshi Wang, Mengwei Qu, Ziteng Lu, Roberto Soria, Jifeng Liu","Light curves serve as a valuable source of information on stellar formation and evolution. With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions. Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries, examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94\% and 99\% correspondingly, with the latter demonstrating a notable 83\% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02\% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM, multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM). Each model is fine-tuned with strategic prompt engineering and customized training methods to explore the emergent abilities of these models for astronomical data. Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies around 90\%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering, thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a substantial decrease of up to 14\% in observation duration and 21\% in sampling points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10\%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10757v1,2024-04
Is DPO Superior to PPO for LLM Alignment? A Comprehensive Study,"Shusheng Xu, Wei Fu, Jiaxuan Gao, Wenjie Ye, Weilin Liu, Zhiyu Mei, Guangju Wang, Chao Yu, Yi Wu","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is currently the most widely used method to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Existing RLHF methods can be roughly categorized as either reward-based or reward-free. Novel applications such as ChatGPT and Claude leverage reward-based methods that first learn a reward model and apply actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, in academic benchmarks, state-of-the-art results are often achieved via reward-free methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Is DPO truly superior to PPO? Why does PPO perform poorly on these benchmarks? In this paper, we first conduct both theoretical and empirical studies on the algorithmic properties of DPO and show that DPO may have fundamental limitations. Moreover, we also comprehensively examine PPO and reveal the key factors for the best performances of PPO in fine-tuning LLMs. Finally, we benchmark DPO and PPO across a collection of RLHF testbeds, ranging from dialogue to code generation. Experiment results demonstrate that PPO is able to surpass other alignment methods in all cases and achieve state-of-the-art results in challenging code competitions.

Autoregressive Pre-Training on Pixels and Texts,"Yekun Chai, Qingyi Liu, Jingwu Xiao, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hua Wu","The integration of visual and textual information represents a promising direction in the advancement of language models. In this paper, we explore the dual modality of language--both visual and textual--within an autoregressive framework, pre-trained on both document images and texts. Our method employs a multimodal training strategy, utilizing visual data through next patch prediction with a regression head and/or textual data through next token prediction with a classification head. We focus on understanding the interaction between these two modalities and their combined impact on model performance. Our extensive evaluation across a wide range of benchmarks shows that incorporating both visual and textual data significantly improves the performance of pixel-based language models. Remarkably, we find that a unidirectional pixel-based model trained solely on visual data can achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art bidirectional models on several language understanding tasks. This work uncovers the untapped potential of integrating visual and textual modalities for more effective language modeling.

Cross-Language Evolution of Divergent Collective Memory Around the Arab Spring,"H. Laurie Jones, Brian C. Keegan","The Arab Spring was a historic set of protests beginning in 2011 that toppled governments and led to major conflicts. Collective memories of events like these can vary significantly across social contexts in response to political, cultural, and linguistic factors. While Wikipedia plays an important role in documenting both historic and current events, little attention has been given to how Wikipedia articles, created in the aftermath of major events, continue to evolve over years or decades. Using the archived content of Arab Spring-related topics across the Arabic and English Wikipedias between 2011 and 2024, we define and evaluate multilingual measures of event salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation of collective memory surrounding the Arab Spring. Our findings about the temporal evolution of the Wikipedia articles' content similarity across languages has implications for theorizing about online collective memory processes and evaluating linguistic models trained on these data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10706v1,2024-04
Question Difficulty Ranking for Multiple-Choice Reading Comprehension,"Vatsal Raina, Mark Gales","Multiple-choice (MC) tests are an efficient method to assess English learners. It is useful for test creators to rank candidate MC questions by difficulty during exam curation. Typically, the difficulty is determined by having human test takers trial the questions in a pretesting stage. However, this is expensive and not scalable. Therefore, we explore automated approaches to rank MC questions by difficulty. However, there is limited data for explicit training of a system for difficulty scores. Hence, we compare task transfer and zero-shot approaches: task transfer adapts level classification and reading comprehension systems for difficulty ranking while zero-shot prompting of instruction finetuned language models contrasts absolute assessment against comparative. It is found that level classification transfers better than reading comprehension. Additionally, zero-shot comparative assessment is more effective at difficulty ranking than the absolute assessment and even the task transfer approaches at question difficulty ranking with a Spearman's correlation of 40.4%. Combining the systems is observed to further boost the correlation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10704v1,2024-04
Integrating knowledge bases to improve coreference and bridging resolution for the chemical domain,"Pengcheng Lu, Massimo Poesio","Resolving coreference and bridging relations in chemical patents is important for better understanding the precise chemical process, where chemical domain knowledge is very critical.

ViTextVQA: A Large-Scale Visual Question Answering Dataset for Evaluating Vietnamese Text Comprehension in Images,"Quan Van Nguyen, Dan Quang Tran, Huy Quang Pham, Thang Kien-Bao Nguyen, Nghia Hieu Nguyen, Kiet Van Nguyen, Ngan Luu-Thuy Nguyen","Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a complicated task that requires the capability of simultaneously processing natural language and images. Initially, this task was researched, focusing on methods to help machines understand objects and scene contexts in images. However, some text appearing in the image that carries explicit information about the full content of the image is not mentioned. Along with the continuous development of the AI era, there have been many studies on the reading comprehension ability of VQA models in the world. As a developing country, conditions are still limited, and this task is still open in Vietnam. Therefore, we introduce the first large-scale dataset in Vietnamese specializing in the ability to understand text appearing in images, we call it ViTextVQA (\textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Text}-based \textbf{V}isual \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering dataset) which contains \textbf{over 16,000} images and \textbf{over 50,000} questions with answers.

Self-playing Adversarial Language Game Enhances LLM Reasoning,"Pengyu Cheng, Tianhao Hu, Han Xu, Zhisong Zhang, Yong Dai, Lei Han, Nan Du","We explore the self-play training procedure of large language models (LLMs) in a two-player adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo. In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players should have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by self-play in this adversarial language game (SPAG). With this goal, we select several open-source LLMs and let each act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performances uniformly improve on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLMs' reasoning abilities.

HLAT: High-quality Large Language Model Pre-trained on AWS Trainium,"Haozheng Fan, Hao Zhou, Guangtai Huang, Parameswaran Raman, Xinwei Fu, Gaurav Gupta, Dhananjay Ram, Yida Wang, Jun Huan","Getting large language models (LLMs) to perform well on the downstream tasks requires pre-training over trillions of tokens. This typically demands a large number of powerful computational devices in addition to a stable distributed training framework to accelerate the training. The growing number of applications leveraging AI/ML led to a scarcity of the expensive conventional accelerators (such as GPUs), which emphasizes the need for the alternative specialized-accelerators that are scalable and cost-efficient. AWS Trainium is the second-generation machine learning accelerator purposely built for training large deep learning models. However, training LLMs with billions of parameters on AWS Trainium is challenging due to its relatively nascent software ecosystem. In this paper, we showcase HLAT: a family of 7B and 70B decoder-only LLMs pre-trained using 4096 AWS Trainium accelerators over 1.8 trillion tokens. The performance of HLAT is benchmarked against popular open source models including LLaMA and OpenLLaMA, which have been trained on NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs, respectively. On various evaluation tasks, we show that HLAT achieves model quality on par with the baselines of similar model size. We also open-source all the training scripts and configurations of HLAT (https://github.com/awslabs/HLAT) and share the best practice of using the NeuronX Distributed Training (NxDT), a customized distributed training library for AWS Trainium. Our work demonstrates that AWS Trainium powered by NxDT is able to successfully pre-train state-of-the-art LLM models with high performance and cost-effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10630v2,2024-04

Construction of Domain-specified Japanese Large Language Model for Finance through Continual Pre-training,"Masanori Hirano, Kentaro Imajo","Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used in various fields, including finance. However, Japanese financial-specific LLMs have not been proposed yet. Hence, this study aims to construct a Japanese financial-specific LLM through continual pre-training. Before tuning, we constructed Japanese financial-focused datasets for continual pre-training. As a base model, we employed a Japanese LLM that achieved state-of-the-art performance on Japanese financial benchmarks among the 10-billion-class parameter models. After continual pre-training using the datasets and the base model, the tuned model performed better than the original model on the Japanese financial benchmarks. Moreover, the outputs comparison results reveal that the tuned model's outputs tend to be better than the original model's outputs in terms of the quality and length of the answers. These findings indicate that domain-specific continual pre-training is also effective for LLMs. The tuned model is publicly available on Hugging Face.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10555v1,2024-04
Unveiling the Misuse Potential of Base Large Language Models via In-Context Learning,"Xiao Wang, Tianze Chen, Xianjun Yang, Qi Zhang, Xun Zhao, Dahua Lin","The open-sourcing of large language models (LLMs) accelerates application development, innovation, and scientific progress. This includes both base models, which are pre-trained on extensive datasets without alignment, and aligned models, deliberately designed to align with ethical standards and human values. Contrary to the prevalent assumption that the inherent instruction-following limitations of base LLMs serve as a safeguard against misuse, our investigation exposes a critical oversight in this belief. By deploying carefully designed demonstrations, our research demonstrates that base LLMs could effectively interpret and execute malicious instructions. To systematically assess these risks, we introduce a novel set of risk evaluation metrics. Empirical results reveal that the outputs from base LLMs can exhibit risk levels on par with those of models fine-tuned for malicious purposes. This vulnerability, requiring neither specialized knowledge nor training, can be manipulated by almost anyone, highlighting the substantial risk and the critical need for immediate attention to the base LLMs' security protocols.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10552v1,2024-04
CoTAR: Chain-of-Thought Attribution Reasoning with Multi-level Granularity,"Moshe Berchansky, Daniel Fleischer, Moshe Wasserblat, Peter Izsak","State-of-the-art performance in QA tasks is currently achieved by systems employing Large Language Models (LLMs), however these models tend to hallucinate information in their responses. One approach focuses on enhancing the generation process by incorporating attribution from the given input to the output. However, the challenge of identifying appropriate attributions and verifying their accuracy against a source is a complex task that requires significant improvements in assessing such systems. We introduce an attribution-oriented Chain-of-Thought reasoning method to enhance the accuracy of attributions. This approach focuses the reasoning process on generating an attribution-centric output. Evaluations on two context-enhanced question-answering datasets using GPT-4 demonstrate improved accuracy and correctness of attributions. In addition, the combination of our method with finetuning enhances the response and attribution accuracy of two smaller LLMs, showing their potential to outperform GPT-4 in some cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10513v2,2024-04
"White Men Lead, Black Women Help? Benchmarking Language Agency Social Biases in LLMs","Yixin Wan, Kai-Wei Chang","Social biases can manifest in language agency. While several studies approached agency-related bias in human-written language, very limited research has investigated such biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content. In addition, previous works often rely on string-matching techniques to identify agentic and communal words within texts, which fall short of accurately classifying language agency. We introduce the novel Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE) benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates biases in LLMs by analyzing agency levels attributed to different demographic groups in model generations. LABE leverages 5,400 template-based prompts, an accurate agency classifier, and corresponding bias metrics to test for gender, racial, and intersectional language agency biases in LLMs on 3 text generation tasks: biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. We also contribute the Language Agency Classification (LAC) dataset, consisting of 3,724 agentic and communal sentences. Using LABE, we unveil language agency social biases in 3 recent LLMs: ChatGPT, Llama3, and Mistral. We observe that: (1) LLM generations tend to demonstrate greater gender bias than human-written texts; (2) Models demonstrate remarkably higher levels of intersectional bias than the other bias aspects. Those who are at the intersection of gender and racial minority groups--such as Black females--are consistently described by texts with lower levels of agency, aligning with real-world social inequalities; (3) Among the 3 LLMs investigated, Llama3 demonstrates the greatest overall bias; (4) Not only does prompt-based mitigation fail to resolve language agency bias in LLMs, but it frequently leads to the exacerbation of biases in generated texts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10508v4,2024-04
A Sentiment Analysis of Medical Text Based on Deep Learning,Yinan Chen,"The field of natural language processing (NLP) has made significant progress with the rapid development of deep learning technologies. One of the research directions in text sentiment analysis is sentiment analysis of medical texts, which holds great potential for application in clinical diagnosis. However, the medical field currently lacks sufficient text datasets, and the effectiveness of sentiment analysis is greatly impacted by different model design approaches, which presents challenges. Therefore, this paper focuses on the medical domain, using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the basic pre-trained model and experimenting with modules such as convolutional neural network (CNN), fully connected network (FCN), and graph convolutional networks (GCN) at the output layer. Experiments and analyses were conducted on the METS-CoV dataset to explore the training performance after integrating different deep learning networks. The results indicate that CNN models outperform other networks when trained on smaller medical text datasets in combination with pre-trained models like BERT.

Self-Supervised Visual Preference Alignment,"Ke Zhu, Zheng Ge, Liang Zhao, Xiangyu Zhang","This paper makes the first attempt towards unsupervised preference alignment in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We generate chosen and rejected responses with regard to the original and augmented image pairs, and conduct preference alignment with direct preference optimization. It is based on a core idea: properly designed augmentation to the image input will induce VLM to generate false but hard negative responses, which helps the model to learn from and produce more robust and powerful answers. The whole pipeline no longer hinges on supervision from GPT-4 or human involvement during alignment, and is highly efficient with few lines of code. With only 8k randomly sampled unsupervised data, it achieves 90\% relative score to GPT-4 on complex reasoning in LLaVA-Bench, and improves LLaVA-7B/13B by 6.7\%/5.6\% score on complex multi-modal benchmark MM-Vet. Visualizations shows its improved ability to align with user-intentions.

When Emotional Stimuli meet Prompt Designing: An Auto-Prompt Graphical Paradigm,"Chenggian Ma, Xiangyu Zhao, Chunhui Zhang, Yanzhao Qin, Wentao Zhang","With the development of Large Language Models (LLM), numerous prompts have been proposed, each with a rich set of features and their own merits. This paper summarizes the prompt words for large language models (LLMs), categorizing them into stimulating and framework types, and proposes an Auto-Prompt Graphical Paradigm(APGP) that combines both stimulating and framework prompts to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs across multiple domains, then exemplifies it with a framework that adheres to this paradigm. The framework involves automated prompt generation and consideration of emotion-stimulus factors, guiding LLMs in problem abstraction, diversified solutions generation, comprehensive optimization, and self-verification after providing answers, ensuring solution accuracy. Compared to traditional stimuli and framework prompts, this framework integrates the advantages of both by adopting automated approaches inspired by APE work, overcoming the limitations of manually designed prompts. Test results on the ruozhiba and BBH datasets demonstrate that this framework can effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs in problem-solving, paving the way for new applications of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10500v1,2024-04
Conversations as a Source for Teaching Scientific Concepts at Different Education Levels,"Donya Rooein, Dirk Hovy","Open conversations are one of the most engaging forms of teaching. However, creating those conversations in educational software is a complex endeavor, especially if we want to address the needs of different audiences. While language models hold great promise for educational applications, there are substantial challenges in training them to engage in meaningful and effective conversational teaching, especially when considering the diverse needs of various audiences. No official data sets exist for this task to facilitate the training of language models for conversational teaching, considering the diverse needs of various audiences. This paper presents a novel source for facilitating conversational teaching of scientific concepts at various difficulty levels (from preschooler to expert), namely dialogues taken from video transcripts. We analyse this data source in various ways to show that it offers a diverse array of examples that can be used to generate contextually appropriate and natural responses to scientific topics for specific target audiences. It is a freely available valuable resource for training and evaluating conversation models, encompassing organically occurring dialogues.

DESTEIN: Navigating Detoxification of Language Models via Universal Steering Pairs and Head-wise Activation Fusion,"Yu Li, Han Jiang, Chuanyang Gong, Zhihua Wei","Despite the remarkable achievements of language models (LMs) across a broad spectrum of tasks, their propensity for generating toxic outputs remains a prevalent concern. Current solutions involving finetuning or auxiliary models usually require extensive computational resources, hindering their practicality in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose DeStein, a novel method that detoxifies LMs by applying representation engineering in activation spaces with lower resource and time costs. Specifically, we derive detoxification vectors from self-induced, universal steering pairs through arithmetic operations in activation spaces. During inference, detoxification is achieved by fusing the detoxification vectors with the original representations in a head-wise manner. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on various metrics, while also maintaining satisfactory generation quality and diversity.

"Language Proficiency and F0 Entrainment: A Study of L2 English Imitation in Italian, French, and Slovak Speakers","Zheng Yuan, Štefan Beňuš, Alessandro D'Ausilio","This study explores F0 entrainment in second language (L2) English speech imitation during an Alternating Reading Task (ART). Participants with Italian, French, and Slovak native languages imitated English utterances, and their F0 entrainment was quantified using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between the parameterized F0 contours of the imitated utterances and those of the model utterances. Results indicate a nuanced relationship between L2 English proficiency and entrainment: speakers with higher proficiency generally exhibit less entrainment in pitch variation and declination. However, within dyads, the more proficient speakers demonstrate a greater ability to mimic pitch range, leading to increased entrainment. This suggests that proficiency influences entrainment differently at individual and dyadic levels, highlighting the complex interplay between language skill and prosodic adaptation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10440v1,2024-04
MAD Speech: Measures of Acoustic Diversity of Speech,"Matthieu Futeral, Andrea Agostinelli, Marco Tagliasacchi, Neil Zeghidour, Eugene Kharitonov","Generative spoken language models produce speech in a wide range of voices, prosody, and recording conditions, seemingly approaching the diversity of natural speech. However, the extent to which generated speech is acoustically diverse remains unclear due to a lack of appropriate metrics. We address this gap by developing lightweight metrics of acoustic diversity, which we collectively refer to as MAD Speech. We focus on measuring five facets of acoustic diversity: voice, gender, emotion, accent, and background noise. We construct the metrics as a composition of specialized, per-facet embedding models and an aggregation function that measures diversity within the embedding space. Next, we build a series of datasets with a priori known diversity preferences for each facet. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve a stronger agreement with the ground-truth diversity than baselines. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our proposed metrics across several real-life evaluation scenarios. MAD Speech will be made publicly accessible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10419v1,2024-04
Reasoning on Efficient Knowledge Paths:Knowledge Graph Guides Large Language Model for Domain Question Answering,"Yuqi Wang, Boran Jiang, Yi Luo, Dawei He, Peng Cheng, Liangcai Gao","Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT3.5, GPT4 and LLAMA2 perform surprisingly well and outperform human experts on many tasks. However, in many domain-specific evaluations, these LLMs often suffer from hallucination problems due to insufficient training of relevant corpus. Furthermore, fine-tuning large models may face problems such as the LLMs are not open source or the construction of high-quality domain instruction is difficult. Therefore, structured knowledge databases such as knowledge graph can better provide domain background knowledge for LLMs and make full use of the reasoning and analysis capabilities of LLMs. In some previous works, LLM was called multiple times to determine whether the current triplet was suitable for inclusion in the subgraph when retrieving subgraphs through a question. Especially for the question that require a multi-hop reasoning path, frequent calls to LLM will consume a lot of computing power. Moreover, when choosing the reasoning path, LLM will be called once for each step, and if one of the steps is selected incorrectly, it will lead to the accumulation of errors in the following steps. In this paper, we integrated and optimized a pipeline for selecting reasoning paths from KG based on LLM, which can reduce the dependency on LLM. In addition, we propose a simple and effective subgraph retrieval method based on chain of thought (CoT) and page rank which can returns the paths most likely to contain the answer. We conduct experiments on three datasets: GenMedGPT-5k [14], WebQuestions [2], and CMCQA [21]. Finally, RoK can demonstrate that using fewer LLM calls can achieve the same results as previous SOTAs models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10384v1,2024-04
Self-Explore: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Language Models with Fine-grained Rewards,"Hyeonbin Hwang, Doyoung Kim, Seungone Kim, Seonghyeon Ye, Minjoon Seo","Training on large amounts of rationales (i.e., CoT Fine-tuning) is effective at improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, acquiring human-authored rationales or augmenting rationales from proprietary models is costly and not scalable. In this paper, we study the problem of whether LLMs could self-improve their reasoning capabilities. To this end, we propose Self-Explore, where the LLM is tasked to explore the first wrong step (i.e., the first pit) within the rationale and use such signals as fine-grained rewards for further improvement. On the GSM8K and MATH test set, Self-Explore achieves 11.57% and 2.89% improvement on average across three LLMs compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our code is available at https://github.com/hbin0701/Self-Explore.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10346v4,2024-04
Relational Graph Convolutional Networks for Sentiment Analysis,"Asal Khosravi, Zahed Rahmati, Ali Vefghi","With the growth of textual data across online platforms, sentiment analysis has become crucial for extracting insights from user-generated content. While traditional approaches and deep learning models have shown promise, they cannot often capture complex relationships between entities. In this paper, we propose leveraging Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCNs) for sentiment analysis, which offer interpretability and flexibility by capturing dependencies between data points represented as nodes in a graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using pre-trained language models such as BERT and RoBERTa with RGCN architecture on product reviews from Amazon and Digikala datasets and evaluating the results. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of RGCNs in capturing relational information for sentiment analysis tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13079v1,2024-04
Enhancing Confidence Expression in Large Language Models Through Learning from Past Experience,"Haixia Han, Tingyun Li, Shisong Chen, Jie Shi, Chengyu Du, Yanghua Xiao, Jiaqing Liang, Xin Lin","Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance across various downstream tasks, but they may generate inaccurate or false information with a confident tone. One of the possible solutions is to empower the LLM confidence expression capability, in which the confidence expressed can be well-aligned with the true probability of the generated answer being correct. However, leveraging the intrinsic ability of LLMs or the signals from the output logits of answers proves challenging in accurately capturing the response uncertainty in LLMs. Therefore, drawing inspiration from cognitive diagnostics, we propose a method of Learning from Past experience (LePe) to enhance the capability for confidence expression. Specifically, we first identify three key problems: (1) How to capture the inherent confidence of the LLM? (2) How to teach the LLM to express confidence? (3) How to evaluate the confidence expression of the LLM? Then we devise three stages in LePe to deal with these problems. Besides, to accurately capture the confidence of an LLM when constructing the training data, we design a complete pipeline including question preparation and answer sampling. We also conduct experiments using the Llama family of LLMs to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method on four datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10315v1,2024-04
Balancing Speciality and Versatility: a Coarse to Fine Framework for Supervised Fine-tuning Large Language Model,"Hengyuan Zhang, Yanru Wu, Dawei Li, Sak Yang, Rui Zhao, Yong Jiang, Fei Tan","Aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase remarkable versatility, capable of handling diverse real-world tasks. Meanwhile, aligned LLMs are also expected to exhibit speciality, excelling in specific applications. However, fine-tuning with extra data, a common practice to gain speciality, often leads to catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously acquired versatility, hindering the model's performance across diverse tasks. In response to this challenge, we propose CoFiTune, a coarse to fine framework in an attempt to strike the balance between speciality and versatility. At the coarse-grained level, an empirical tree-search algorithm is utilized to pinpoint and update specific modules that are crucial for speciality, while keeping other parameters frozen; at the fine-grained level, a soft-masking mechanism regulates the update to the LLMs, mitigating the CF issue without harming speciality. In an overall evaluation of both speciality and versatility, CoFiTune consistently outperforms baseline methods across diverse tasks and model scales. Compared to the full-parameter SFT, CoFiTune leads to about 14% versatility improvement and marginal speciality loss on a 13B model. Lastly, based on further analysis, we provide a speculative insight into the information forwarding process in LLMs, which helps explain the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/rattlesnakey/CoFiTune.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10306v5,2024-04
Exploring Social Media Posts for Depression Identification: A Study on Reddit Dataset,"Nandigramam Sai Harshit, Nilesh Kumar Sahu, Haroon R.

In this work, we investigated the possibility of utilizing social media posts to identify depression in individuals. To achieve this goal, we conducted a preliminary study where we extracted and analyzed the top Reddit posts made in 2022 from depression-related forums. The collected data were labeled as depressive and non-depressive using UMLS Metathesaurus. Further, the pre-processed data were fed to classical machine learning models, where we achieved an accuracy of 92.28\% in predicting the depressive and non-depressive posts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06656v1,2024-04
Future Language Modeling from Temporal Document History,"Changmao Li, Jeffrey Flanigan","Predicting the future is of great interest across many aspects of human activity. Businesses are interested in future trends, traders are interested in future stock prices, and companies are highly interested in future technological breakthroughs. While there are many automated systems for predicting future numerical data, such as weather, stock prices, and demand for products, there is relatively little work in automatically predicting textual data. Humans are interested in textual data predictions because it is a natural format for our consumption, and experts routinely make predictions in a textual format (Christensen et al., 2004; Tetlock & Gardner, 2015; Frick, 2015). However, there has been relatively little formalization of this general problem in the machine learning or natural language processing communities. To address this gap, we introduce the task of future language modeling: probabilistic modeling of texts in the future based on a temporal history of texts. To our knowledge, our work is the first work to formalize the task of predicting the future in this way. We show that it is indeed possible to build future language models that improve upon strong non-temporal language model baselines, opening the door to working on this important, and widely applicable problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10297v1,2024-04
Empowering Interdisciplinary Research with BERT-Based Models: An Approach Through SciBERT-CNN with Topic Modeling,"Darya Likhareva, Hamsini Sankaran, Sivakumar Thiyagarajan","Researchers must stay current in their fields by regularly reviewing academic literature, a task complicated by the daily publication of thousands of papers. Traditional multi-label text classification methods often ignore semantic relationships and fail to address the inherent class imbalances. This paper introduces a novel approach using the SciBERT model and CNNs to systematically categorize academic abstracts from the Elsevier OA CC-BY corpus. We use a multi-segment input strategy that processes abstracts, body text, titles, and keywords obtained via BERT topic modeling through SciBERT. Here, the [CLS] token embeddings capture the contextual representation of each segment, concatenated and processed through a CNN. The CNN uses convolution and pooling to enhance feature extraction and reduce dimensionality, optimizing the data for classification. Additionally, we incorporate class weights based on label frequency to address the class imbalance, significantly improving the classification F1 score and enhancing text classification systems and literature review efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13078v2,2024-04

Jacobs, Nathan Lambert, Milan Mossé, Eric Pacuit, Stuart Russell, Hailey Schoelkopf, Emanuel Tewolde, William S. Zwicker","Foundation models such as GPT-4 are fine-tuned to avoid unsafe or otherwise problematic behavior, such as helping to commit crimes or producing racist text. One approach to fine-tuning, called reinforcement learning from human feedback, learns from humans' expressed preferences over multiple outputs. Another approach is constitutional AI, in which the input from humans is a list of high-level principles. But how do we deal with potentially diverging input from humans? How can we aggregate the input into consistent data about ""collective"" preferences or otherwise use it to make collective choices about model behavior?

Modeling Low-Resource Health Coaching Dialogues via Neuro-Symbolic Goal Summarization and Text-Units-Text Generation,"Yue Zhou, Barbara Di Eugenio, Brian Ziebart, Lisa Sharp, Bing Liu, Nikolaos Agadakos","Health coaching helps patients achieve personalized and lifestyle-related goals, effectively managing chronic conditions and alleviating mental health issues. It is particularly beneficial, however cost-prohibitive, for low-socioeconomic status populations due to its highly personalized and labor-intensive nature. In this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic goal summarizer to support health coaches in keeping track of the goals and a text-units-text dialogue generation model that converses with patients and helps them create and accomplish specific goals for physical activities. Our models outperform previous state-of-the-art while eliminating the need for predefined schema and corresponding annotation. We also propose a new health coaching dataset extending previous work and a metric to measure the unconventionality of the patient's response based on data difficulty, facilitating potential coach alerts during deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10268v1,2024-04
Improving the Capabilities of Large Language Model Based Marketing Analytics Copilots With Semantic Search And Fine-Tuning,"Yilin Gao, Sai Kumar Arava, Yancheng Li, James W. Snyder Jr","Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely deployed to solve problems related to marketing attribution and budget optimization. However, AI models can be quite complex, and it can be difficult to understand model workings and insights without extensive implementation teams. In principle, recently developed large language models (LLMs), like GPT-4, can be deployed to provide marketing insights, reducing the time and effort required to make critical decisions. In practice, there are substantial challenges that need to be overcome to reliably use such models. We focus on domain-specific question-answering, SQL generation needed for data retrieval, and tabular analysis and show how a combination of semantic search, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning can be applied to dramatically improve the ability of LLMs to execute these tasks accurately. We compare both proprietary models, like GPT-4, and open-source models, like Llama-2-70b, as well as various embedding methods. These models are tested on sample use cases specific to marketing mix modeling and attribution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13077v1,2024-04
Uncovering Latent Arguments in Social Media Messaging by Employing LLMs-in-the-Loop Strategy,"Tunazzina Islam, Dan Goldwasser","The widespread use of social media has led to a surge in popularity for automated methods of analyzing public opinion. Supervised methods are adept at text categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a continual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the focus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting themes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching patterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant portion of research into social media discourse still depends on labor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach, which are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of discovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic LLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k Facebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Additionally, we design a downstream task as stance prediction by leveraging talking points in climate debates. Furthermore, we analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on real-world events.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10259v3,2024-04
Med-MoE: Mixture of Domain-Specific Experts for Lightweight Medical Vision-Language Models,"Songtao Jiang, Tuo Zheng, Yan Zhang, Yeying Jin, Li Yuan, Zuozhu Liu","Recent advancements in general-purpose or domain-specific multimodal large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable progress for medical decision-making. However, they are designated for specific classification or generative tasks, and require model training or finetuning on large-scale datasets with sizeable parameters and tremendous computing, hindering their clinical utility across diverse resource-constrained scenarios in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight framework Med-MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) that tackles both discriminative and generative multimodal medical tasks. The learning of Med-MoE consists of three steps: multimodal medical alignment, instruction tuning and routing, and domain-specific MoE tuning. After aligning multimodal medical images with LLM tokens, we then enable the model for different multimodal medical tasks with instruction tuning, together with a trainable router tailored for expert selection across input modalities. Finally, the model is tuned by integrating the router with multiple domain-specific experts, which are selectively activated and further empowered by meta expert. Comprehensive experiments on both open- and close-end medical question answering (Med-VQA) and image classification tasks across datasets such as VQA-RAD, SLAKE and Path-VQA demonstrate that our model can achieve performance superior to or on par with state-of-the-art baselines, while only requiring approximately 30\%-50\% of activated model parameters. Extensive analysis and ablations corroborate the effectiveness and practical utility of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10237v3,2024-04
Generative Text Steganography with Large Language Model,"Jiaxuan Wu, Zhengxian Wu, Yiming Xue, Juan Wen, Wanli Peng","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have blurred the boundary of high-quality text generation between humans and machines, which is favorable for generative text steganography. While, current advanced steganographic mapping is not suitable for LLMs since most users are restricted to accessing only the black-box API or user interface of the LLMs, thereby lacking access to the training vocabulary and its sampling probabilities. In this paper, we explore a black-box generative text steganographic method based on the user interfaces of large language models, which is called LLM-Stega. The main goal of LLM-Stega is that the secure covert communication between Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver) is conducted by using the user interfaces of LLMs. Specifically, We first construct a keyword set and design a new encrypted steganographic mapping to embed secret messages. Furthermore, to guarantee accurate extraction of secret messages and rich semantics of generated stego texts, an optimization mechanism based on reject sampling is proposed. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LLM-Stega outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10229v2,2024-04
Two-Stage Stance Labeling: User-Hashtag Heuristics with Graph Neural Networks,"Joshua Melton, Shannon Reid, Gabriel Terejanu, Siddharth Krishnan","The high volume and rapid evolution of content on social media present major challenges for studying the stance of social media users. In this work, we develop a two stage stance labeling method that utilizes the user-hashtag bipartite graph and the user-user interaction graph. In the first stage, a simple and efficient heuristic for stance labeling uses the user-hashtag bipartite graph to iteratively update the stance association of user and hashtag nodes via a label propagation mechanism. This set of soft labels is then integrated with the user-user interaction graph to train a graph neural network (GNN) model using semi-supervised learning. We evaluate this method on two large-scale datasets containing tweets related to climate change from June 2021 to June 2022 and gun control from January 2022 to January 2023. Our experiments demonstrate that enriching text-based embeddings of users with network information from the user interaction graph using our semi-supervised GNN method outperforms both classifiers trained on user textual embeddings and zero-shot classification using LLMs such as GPT4. We discuss the need for integrating nuanced understanding from social science with the scalability of computational methods to better understand how polarization on social media occurs for divisive issues such as climate change and gun control.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10228v2,2024-04
Find The Gap: Knowledge Base Reasoning For Visual Question Answering,"Elham J. Barezi, Parisa Kordjamshidi","We analyze knowledge-based visual question answering, for which given a question, the models need to ground it into the visual modality and retrieve the relevant knowledge from a given large knowledge base (KB) to be able to answer. Our analysis has two folds, one based on designing neural architectures and training them from scratch, and another based on large pre-trained language models (LLMs). Our research questions are: 1) Can we effectively augment models by explicit supervised retrieval of the relevant KB information to solve the KB-VQA problem? 2) How do task-specific and LLM-based models perform in the integration of visual and external knowledge, and multi-hop reasoning over both sources of information? 3) Is the implicit knowledge of LLMs sufficient for KB-VQA and to what extent it can replace the explicit KB? Our results demonstrate the positive impact of empowering task-specific and LLM models with supervised external and visual knowledge retrieval models. Our findings show that though LLMs are stronger in 1-hop reasoning, they suffer in 2-hop reasoning in comparison with our fine-tuned NN model even if the relevant information from both modalities is available to the model. Moreover, we observed that LLM models outperform the NN model for KB-related questions which confirms the effectiveness of implicit knowledge in LLMs however, they do not alleviate the need for external KB.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10226v1,2024-04
CULTURE-GEN: Revealing Global Cultural Perception in Language Models through Natural Language Prompting,"Huihan Li, Liwei Jiang, Jena D.

In this work, we uncover culture perceptions of three SOTA models on 110 countries and regions on 8 culture-related topics through culture-conditioned generations, and extract symbols from these generations that are associated to each culture by the LLM. We discover that culture-conditioned generation consist of linguistic ""markers"" that distinguish marginalized cultures apart from default cultures. We also discover that LLMs have an uneven degree of diversity in the culture symbols, and that cultures from different geographic regions have different presence in LLMs' culture-agnostic generation. Our findings promote further research in studying the knowledge and fairness of global culture perception in LLMs. Code and Data can be found here: https://github.com/huihanlhh/Culture-Gen/",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10199v5,2024-04
ClashEval: Quantifying the tug-of-war between an LLM's internal prior and external evidence,"Kevin Wu, Eric Wu, James Zou","Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is frequently used to mitigate hallucinations and provide up-to-date knowledge for large language models (LLMs). However, given that document retrieval is an imprecise task and sometimes results in erroneous or even harmful content being presented in context, this raises the question of how LLMs handle retrieved information: If the provided content is incorrect, does the model know to ignore it, or does it recapitulate the error? Conversely, when the model's initial response is incorrect, does it always know to use the retrieved information to correct itself, or does it insist on its wrong prior response? To answer this, we curate a dataset of over 1200 questions across six domains (e.g., drug dosages, Olympic records, locations) along with content relevant to answering each question. We further apply precise perturbations to the answers in the content that range from subtle to blatant errors. We benchmark six top-performing LLMs, including GPT-4o, on this dataset and find that LLMs are susceptible to adopting incorrect retrieved content, overriding their own correct prior knowledge over 60% of the time. However, the more unrealistic the retrieved content is (i.e. more deviated from truth), the less likely the model is to adopt it. Also, the less confident a model is in its initial response (via measuring token probabilities), the more likely it is to adopt the information in the retrieved content. We exploit this finding and demonstrate simple methods for improving model accuracy where there is conflicting retrieved content. Our results highlight a difficult task and benchmark for LLMs -- namely, their ability to correctly discern when it is wrong in light of correct retrieved content and to reject cases when the provided content is incorrect.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10198v2,2024-04
Deferred NAM: Low-latency Top-K Context Injection via Deferred Context Encoding for Non-Streaming ASR,"Zelin Wu, Gan Song, Christopher Li, Pat Rondon, Zhong Meng, Xavier Velez, Weiran Wang, Diamantino Caseiro, Golan Pundak, Tsendsuren Munkhdalai, Angad Chandorkar, Rohit Prabhavalkar","Contextual biasing enables speech recognizers to transcribe important phrases in the speaker's context, such as contact names, even if they are rare in, or absent from, the training data. Attention-based biasing is a leading approach which allows for full end-to-end cotraining of the recognizer and biasing system and requires no separate inference-time components. Such biasers typically consist of a context encoder; followed by a context filter which narrows down the context to apply, improving per-step inference time; and, finally, context application via cross attention. Though much work has gone into optimizing per-frame performance, the context encoder is at least as important: recognition cannot begin before context encoding ends. Here, we show the lightweight phrase selection pass can be moved before context encoding, resulting in a speedup of up to 16.1 times and enabling biasing to scale to 20K phrases with a maximum pre-decoding delay under 33ms. With the addition of phrase- and wordpiece-level cross-entropy losses, our technique also achieves up to a 37.5% relative WER reduction over the baseline without the losses and lightweight phrase selection pass.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10180v2,2024-04
On the Effects of Fine-tuning Language Models for Text-Based Reinforcement Learning,"Mauricio Gruppi, Soham Dan, Keerthiram Murugesan, Subhajit Chaudhury","Text-based reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with a fictional environment using observed text and admissible actions in natural language to complete a task. Previous works have shown that agents can succeed in text-based interactive environments even in the complete absence of semantic understanding or other linguistic capabilities. The success of these agents in playing such games suggests that semantic understanding may not be important for the task. This raises an important question about the benefits of LMs in guiding the agents through the game states. In this work, we show that rich semantic understanding leads to efficient training of text-based RL agents. Moreover, we describe the occurrence of semantic degeneration as a consequence of inappropriate fine-tuning of language models in text-based reinforcement learning (TBRL). Specifically, we describe the shift in the semantic representation of words in the LM, as well as how it affects the performance of the agent in tasks that are semantically similar to the training games. We believe these results may help develop better strategies to fine-tune agents in text-based RL scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10174v1,2024-04
TabSQLify: Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs Through Table Decomposition,"Md Mahadi Hasan Nahid, Davood Rafiei","Table reasoning is a challenging task that requires understanding both natural language questions and structured tabular data. Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but they often struggle with large tables due to their limited input length. In this paper, we propose TabSQLify, a novel method that leverages text-to-SQL generation to decompose tables into smaller and relevant sub-tables, containing only essential information for answering questions or verifying statements, before performing the reasoning task. In our comprehensive evaluation on four challenging datasets, our approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance compared to prevailing methods reliant on full tables as input. Moreover, our method can reduce the input context length significantly, making it more scalable and efficient for large-scale table reasoning applications. Our method performs remarkably well on the WikiTQ benchmark, achieving an accuracy of 64.7%. Additionally, on the TabFact benchmark, it achieves a high accuracy of 79.5%. These results surpass other LLM-based baseline models on gpt-3.5-turbo (chatgpt). TabSQLify can reduce the table size significantly alleviating the computational load on LLMs when handling large tables without compromising performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10150v1,2024-04
ANCHOR: LLM-driven News Subject Conditioning for Text-to-Image Synthesis,"Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan, Sharon X. Huang, Dongwon Lee","Text-to-Image (T2I) Synthesis has made tremendous strides in enhancing synthesized image quality, but current datasets evaluate model performance only on descriptive, instruction-based prompts. Real-world news image captions take a more pragmatic approach, providing high-level situational and Named-Entity (NE) information and limited physical object descriptions, making them abstractive. To evaluate the ability of T2I models to capture intended subjects from news captions, we introduce the Abstractive News Captions with High-level cOntext Representation (ANCHOR) dataset, containing 70K+ samples sourced from 5 different news media organizations. With Large Language Models (LLM) achieving success in language and commonsense reasoning tasks, we explore the ability of different LLMs to identify and understand key subjects from abstractive captions. Our proposed method Subject-Aware Finetuning (SAFE), selects and enhances the representation of key subjects in synthesized images by leveraging LLM-generated subject weights. It also adapts to the domain distribution of news images and captions through custom Domain Fine-tuning, outperforming current T2I baselines on ANCHOR. By launching the ANCHOR dataset, we hope to motivate research in furthering the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities of T2I models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10141v1,2024-04
Language Model Cascades: Token-level uncertainty and beyond,"Neha Gupta, Harikrishna Narasimhan, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Ankit Singh Rawat, Aditya Krishna Menon, Sanjiv Kumar","Recent advances in language models (LMs) have led to significant improvements in quality on complex NLP tasks, but at the expense of increased inference costs. Cascading offers a simple strategy to achieve more favorable cost-quality tradeoffs: here, a small model is invoked for most ""easy"" instances, while a few ""hard"" instances are deferred to the large model. While the principles underpinning cascading are well-studied for classification tasks - with deferral based on predicted class uncertainty favored theoretically and practically - a similar understanding is lacking for generative LM tasks. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of deferral rules for LM cascades. We begin by examining the natural extension of predicted class uncertainty to generative LM tasks, namely, the predicted sequence uncertainty. We show that this measure suffers from the length bias problem, either over- or under-emphasizing outputs based on their lengths. This is because LMs produce a sequence of uncertainty values, one for each output token; and moreover, the number of output tokens is variable across examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose to exploit the richer token-level uncertainty information implicit in generative LMs. We argue that naive predicted sequence uncertainty corresponds to a simple aggregation of these uncertainties. By contrast, we show that incorporating token-level uncertainty through learned post-hoc deferral rules can significantly outperform such simple aggregation strategies, via experiments on a range of natural language benchmarks with FLAN-T5 models. We further show that incorporating embeddings from the smaller model and intermediate layers of the larger model can give an additional boost in the overall cost-quality tradeoff.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10136v1,2024-04

AIGeN: An Adversarial Approach for Instruction Generation in VLN,"Niyati Rawal, Roberto Bigazzi, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara","In the last few years, the research interest in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has grown significantly. VLN is a challenging task that involves an agent following human instructions and navigating in a previously unknown environment to reach a specified goal. Recent work in literature focuses on different ways to augment the available datasets of instructions for improving navigation performance by exploiting synthetic training data. In this work, we propose AIGeN, a novel architecture inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that produces meaningful and well-formed synthetic instructions to improve navigation agents' performance. The model is composed of a Transformer decoder (GPT-2) and a Transformer encoder (BERT). During the training phase, the decoder generates sentences for a sequence of images describing the agent's path to a particular point while the encoder discriminates between real and fake instructions. Experimentally, we evaluate the quality of the generated instructions and perform extensive ablation studies.

MMInA: Benchmarking Multihop Multimodal Internet Agents,"Ziniu Zhang, Shulin Tian, Liangyu Chen, Ziwei Liu","Autonomous embodied agents live on an Internet of multimedia websites. Can they hop around multimodal websites to complete complex user tasks? Existing benchmarks fail to assess them in a realistic, evolving environment for their embodiment across websites. To answer this question, we present MMInA, a multihop and multimodal benchmark to evaluate the embodied agents for compositional Internet tasks, with several appealing properties: 1) Evolving real-world multimodal websites. Our benchmark uniquely operates on evolving real-world websites, ensuring a high degree of realism and applicability to natural user tasks. Our data includes 1,050 human-written tasks covering various domains such as shopping and travel, with each task requiring the agent to autonomously extract multimodal information from web pages as observations; 2) Multihop web browsing. Our dataset features naturally compositional tasks that require information from or actions on multiple websites to solve, to assess long-range reasoning capabilities on web tasks; 3) Holistic evaluation. We propose a novel protocol for evaluating an agent's progress in completing multihop tasks. We experiment with both standalone (multimodal) language models and heuristic-based web agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while long-chain multihop web tasks are easy for humans, they remain challenging for state-of-the-art web agents. We identify that agents are more likely to fail on the early hops when solving tasks of more hops, which results in lower task success rates. To address this issue, we propose a simple memory augmentation approach replaying past action trajectories to reflect. Our method significantly improved both the single-hop and multihop web browsing abilities of agents. See our code and data at https://mmina.cliangyu.com",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09992v1,2024-04
Memory Sharing for Large Language Model based Agents,"Hang Gao, Yongfeng Zhang","The adaptation of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to execute tasks via natural language prompts represents a significant advancement, notably eliminating the need for explicit retraining or fine tuning, but are constrained by the comprehensiveness and diversity of the provided examples, leading to outputs that often diverge significantly from expected results, especially when it comes to the open-ended questions. This paper introduces the Memory Sharing, a framework which integrates the real-time memory filter, storage and retrieval to enhance the In-Context Learning process. This framework allows for the sharing of memories among multiple agents, whereby the interactions and shared memories between different agents effectively enhance the diversity of the memories. The collective self-enhancement through interactive learning among multiple agents facilitates the evolution from individual intelligence to collective intelligence. Besides, the dynamically growing memory pool is utilized not only to improve the quality of responses but also to train and enhance the retriever. We evaluated our framework across three distinct domains involving specialized tasks of agents. The experimental results demonstrate that the MS framework significantly improves the agents' performance in addressing open-ended questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09982v2,2024-04
Context Does Matter: Implications for Crowdsourced Evaluation Labels in Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems,"Clemencia Siro, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Maarten de Rijke","Crowdsourced labels play a crucial role in evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems (TDSs). Obtaining high-quality and consistent ground-truth labels from annotators presents challenges. When evaluating a TDS, annotators must fully comprehend the dialogue before providing judgments. Previous studies suggest using only a portion of the dialogue context in the annotation process. However, the impact of this limitation on label quality remains unexplored. This study investigates the influence of dialogue context on annotation quality, considering the truncated context for relevance and usefulness labeling. We further propose to use large language models (LLMs) to summarize the dialogue context to provide a rich and short description of the dialogue context and study the impact of doing so on the annotator's performance. Reducing context leads to more positive ratings. Conversely, providing the entire dialogue context yields higher-quality relevance ratings but introduces ambiguity in usefulness ratings. Using the first user utterance as context leads to consistent ratings, akin to those obtained using the entire dialogue, with significantly reduced annotation effort. Our findings show how task design, particularly the availability of dialogue context, affects the quality and consistency of crowdsourced evaluation labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09980v1,2024-04
Constructing Benchmarks and Interventions for Combating Hallucinations in LLMs,"Adi Simhi, Jonathan Herzig, Idan Szpektor, Yonatan Belinkov","Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, which sparked a widespread effort to detect and prevent them. Recent work attempts to mitigate hallucinations by intervening in the model's generation, typically computing representative vectors of hallucinations vs. grounded generations, for steering the model's hidden states away from a hallucinatory state. However, common studies employ different setups and do not properly separate different possible causes of hallucinations, making interventions misguided. In this work, we introduce a method for categorizing examples based on the model's prior knowledge, named WACK. We construct WACK benchmarks that support interventions in two settings: open-book and closed-book question answering. Using the benchmarks, we perform an extensive investigation of the effect of different choices for intervention, such as the intervened components, and how often and how strongly to intervene. We find that intervention success varies depending on the component, with the attention blocks performing well and the residual stream proving detrimental to language modeling capabilities. We also show that interventions can benefit from representative vectors collected before, rather than after, a hallucination occurs. Finally, we introduce a new dynamic intervention, which intervenes only if needed, and thus is more robust than standard static interventions.

Tango 2: Aligning Diffusion-based Text-to-Audio Generations through Direct Preference Optimization,"Navonil Majumder, Chia-Yu Hung, Deepanway Ghosal, Wei-Ning Hsu, Rada Mihalcea, Soujanya Poria","Generative multimodal content is increasingly prevalent in much of the content creation arena, as it has the potential to allow artists and media personnel to create pre-production mockups by quickly bringing their ideas to life. The generation of audio from text prompts is an important aspect of such processes in the music and film industry. Many of the recent diffusion-based text-to-audio models focus on training increasingly sophisticated diffusion models on a large set of datasets of prompt-audio pairs. These models do not explicitly focus on the presence of concepts or events and their temporal ordering in the output audio with respect to the input prompt. Our hypothesis is focusing on how these aspects of audio generation could improve audio generation performance in the presence of limited data. As such, in this work, using an existing text-to-audio model Tango, we synthetically create a preference dataset where each prompt has a winner audio output and some loser audio outputs for the diffusion model to learn from. The loser outputs, in theory, have some concepts from the prompt missing or in an incorrect order. We fine-tune the publicly available Tango text-to-audio model using diffusion-DPO (direct preference optimization) loss on our preference dataset and show that it leads to improved audio output over Tango and AudioLDM2, in terms of both automatic- and manual-evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09956v4,2024-04
Compression Represents Intelligence Linearly,"Yuzhen Huang, Jinghan Zhang, Zifei Shan, Junxian He","There is a belief that learning to compress well will lead to intelligence. Recently, language modeling has been shown to be equivalent to compression, which offers a compelling rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs): the development of more advanced language models is essentially enhancing compression which facilitates intelligence. Despite such appealing discussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between compression and intelligence. In this work, we examine their relationship in the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors. Given the abstract concept of ""intelligence"", we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 31 public LLMs that originate from diverse organizations. Remarkably, we find that LLMs' intelligence -- reflected by average benchmark scores -- almost linearly correlates with their ability to compress external text corpora. These results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that superior compression indicates greater intelligence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compression efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is linearly associated with the model capabilities. We open-source our compression datasets as well as our data collection pipelines to facilitate future researchers to assess compression properly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09937v2,2024-04

LLM Evaluators Recognize and Favor Their Own Generations,"Arjun Panickssery, Samuel R. Bowman, Shi Feng","Self-evaluation using large language models (LLMs) has proven valuable not only in benchmarking but also methods like reward modeling, constitutional AI, and self-refinement. But new biases are introduced due to the same LLM acting as both the evaluator and the evaluatee. One such bias is self-preference, where an LLM evaluator scores its own outputs higher than others' while human annotators consider them of equal quality. But do LLMs actually recognize their own outputs when they give those texts higher scores, or is it just a coincidence? In this paper, we investigate if self-recognition capability contributes to self-preference. We discover that, out of the box, LLMs such as GPT-4 and Llama 2 have non-trivial accuracy at distinguishing themselves from other LLMs and humans. By fine-tuning LLMs, we discover a linear correlation between self-recognition capability and the strength of self-preference bias; using controlled experiments, we show that the causal explanation resists straightforward confounders. We discuss how self-recognition can interfere with unbiased evaluations and AI safety more generally.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13076v1,2024-04
Detecting AI Generated Text Based on NLP and Machine Learning Approaches,Nuzhat Prova,"Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) may enable artificial intelligence (AI) models to generate writing that is identical to human written form in the future. This might have profound ethical, legal, and social repercussions. This study aims to address this problem by offering an accurate AI detector model that can differentiate between electronically produced text and human-written text. Our approach includes machine learning methods such as XGB Classifier, SVM, BERT architecture deep learning models. Furthermore, our results show that the BERT performs better than previous models in identifying information generated by AI from information provided by humans. Provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of AI-generated text identification in our assessment of pertinent studies. Our testing yielded positive findings, showing that our strategy is successful, with the BERT emerging as the most probable answer. We analyze the research's societal implications, highlighting the possible advantages for various industries while addressing sustainability issues pertaining to morality and the environment.

ChatShop: Interactive Information Seeking with Language Agents,"Sanxing Chen, Sam Wiseman, Bhuwan Dhingra","The desire and ability to seek new information strategically are fundamental to human learning but often overlooked in current language agent evaluation. We analyze a popular web shopping task designed to test language agents' ability to perform strategic exploration and discover that it can be reformulated and solved as a single-turn retrieval task without the need for interactive information seeking. This finding encourages us to rethink realistic constraints on information access that would necessitate strategic information seeking. We then redesign the task to introduce a notion of task ambiguity and the role of a shopper, serving as a dynamic party with whom the agent strategically interacts in an open-ended conversation to make informed decisions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed task can effectively evaluate the agent's ability to explore and gradually accumulate information through multi-turn interactions. Additionally, we show that large language model-simulated shoppers serve as a good proxy for real human shoppers, revealing similar error patterns in agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09911v2,2024-04
Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion,"Jiayi Li, Ruilin Luo, Jiaqi Sun, Jing Xiao, Yujiu Yang","Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has emerged as a promising solution to address the issue of incompleteness within Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Traditional KGC research primarily centers on triple classification and link prediction. Nevertheless, we contend that these tasks do not align well with real-world scenarios and merely serve as surrogate benchmarks. In this paper, we investigate three crucial processes relevant to real-world construction scenarios: (a) the verification process, which arises from the necessity and limitations of human verifiers; (b) the mining process, which identifies the most promising candidates for verification; and (c) the training process, which harnesses verified data for subsequent utilization; in order to achieve a transition toward more realistic challenges. By integrating these three processes, we introduce the Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion (PKGC) task, which simulates the gradual completion of KGs in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to expedite PKGC processing, we propose two acceleration modules: Optimized Top-$k$ algorithm and Semantic Validity Filter. These modules significantly enhance the efficiency of the mining procedure. Our experiments demonstrate that performance in link prediction does not accurately reflect performance in PKGC. A more in-depth analysis reveals the key factors influencing the results and provides potential directions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09897v1,2024-04
Glitch Tokens in Large Language Models: Categorization Taxonomy and Effective Detection,"Yuxi Li, Yi Liu, Gelei Deng, Ying Zhang, Wenjia Song, Ling Shi, Kailong Wang, Yuekang Li, Yang Liu, Haoyu Wang","With the expanding application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains, it becomes imperative to comprehensively investigate their unforeseen behaviors and consequent outcomes. In this study, we introduce and systematically explore the phenomenon of ""glitch tokens"", which are anomalous tokens produced by established tokenizers and could potentially compromise the models' quality of response. Specifically, we experiment on seven top popular LLMs utilizing three distinct tokenizers and involving a totally of 182,517 tokens. We present categorizations of the identified glitch tokens and symptoms exhibited by LLMs when interacting with glitch tokens. Based on our observation that glitch tokens tend to cluster in the embedding space, we propose GlitchHunter, a novel iterative clustering-based technique, for efficient glitch token detection. The evaluation shows that our approach notably outperforms three baseline methods on eight open-source LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first comprehensive study on glitch tokens. Our new detection further provides valuable insights into mitigating tokenization-related errors in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09894v3,2024-04
Is Table Retrieval a Solved Problem? Exploring Join-Aware Multi-Table Retrieval,"Peter Baile Chen, Yi Zhang, Dan Roth","Retrieving relevant tables containing the necessary information to accurately answer a given question over tables is critical to open-domain question-answering (QA) systems. Previous methods assume the answer to such a question can be found either in a single table or multiple tables identified through question decomposition or rewriting. However, neither of these approaches is sufficient, as many questions require retrieving multiple tables and joining them through a join plan that cannot be discerned from the user query itself. If the join plan is not considered in the retrieval stage, the subsequent steps of reasoning and answering based on those retrieved tables are likely to be incorrect. To address this problem, we introduce a method that uncovers useful join relations for any query and database during table retrieval. We use a novel re-ranking method formulated as a mixed-integer program that considers not only table-query relevance but also table-table relevance that requires inferring join relationships. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for table retrieval by up to 9.3% in F1 score and for end-to-end QA by up to 5.4% in accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09889v2,2024-04

We show how it is possible to apply principled software engineering techniques to enhance AI-driven legal reasoning of complex statutes and to unlock new applications in automated meta-reasoning such as mutation-guided example generation and metamorphic property-based testing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09868v2,2024-04

Negation Triplet Extraction with Syntactic Dependency and Semantic Consistency,"Yuchen Shi, Deqing Yang, Jingping Liu, Yanghua Xiao, Zongyu Wang, Huimin Xu","Previous works of negation understanding mainly focus on negation cue detection and scope resolution, without identifying negation subject which is also significant to the downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a new negation triplet extraction (NTE) task which aims to extract negation subject along with negation cue and scope. To achieve NTE, we devise a novel Syntax&Semantic-Enhanced Negation Extraction model, namely SSENE, which is built based on a generative pretrained language model (PLM) {of Encoder-Decoder architecture} with a multi-task learning framework. Specifically, the given sentence's syntactic dependency tree is incorporated into the PLM's encoder to discover the correlations between the negation subject, cue and scope. Moreover, the semantic consistency between the sentence and the extracted triplet is ensured by an auxiliary task learning. Furthermore, we have constructed a high-quality Chinese dataset NegComment based on the users' reviews from the real-world platform of Meituan, upon which our evaluations show that SSENE achieves the best NTE performance compared to the baselines. Our ablation and case studies also demonstrate that incorporating the syntactic information helps the PLM's recognize the distant dependency between the subject and cue, and the auxiliary task learning is helpful to extract the negation triplets with more semantic consistency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09830v1,2024-04
Impact of Preference Noise on the Alignment Performance of Generative Language Models,"Yang Gao, Dana Alon, Donald Metzler","A key requirement in developing Generative Language Models (GLMs) is to have their values aligned with human values. Preference-based alignment is a widely used paradigm for this purpose, in which preferences over generation pairs are first elicited from human annotators or AI systems, and then fed into some alignment techniques, e.g., Direct Preference Optimization. However, a substantial percent (20 - 40%) of the preference pairs used in GLM alignment are noisy, and it remains unclear how the noise affects the alignment performance and how to mitigate its negative impact. In this paper, we propose a framework to inject desirable amounts and types of noise to the preferences, and systematically study the impact of preference noise on the alignment performance in two tasks (summarization and dialogue generation). We find that the alignment performance can be highly sensitive to the noise rates in the preference data: e.g., a 10 percentage points (pp) increase of the noise rate can lead to 30 pp drop in the alignment performance (in win rate). To mitigate the impact of noise, confidence-based data filtering shows significant benefit when certain types of noise are present. We hope our work can help the community better understand and mitigate the impact of preference noise in GLM alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09824v1,2024-04
"Benchmarking Llama2, Mistral, Gemma and GPT for Factuality, Toxicity, Bias and Propensity for Hallucinations","David Nadeau, Mike Kroutikov, Karen McNeil, Simon Baribeau","This paper introduces fourteen novel datasets for the evaluation of Large Language Models' safety in the context of enterprise tasks. A method was devised to evaluate a model's safety, as determined by its ability to follow instructions and output factual, unbiased, grounded, and appropriate content. In this research, we used OpenAI GPT as point of comparison since it excels at all levels of safety. On the open-source side, for smaller models, Meta Llama2 performs well at factuality and toxicity but has the highest propensity for hallucination. Mistral hallucinates the least but cannot handle toxicity well. It performs well in a dataset mixing several tasks and safety vectors in a narrow vertical domain. Gemma, the newly introduced open-source model based on Google Gemini, is generally balanced but trailing behind. When engaging in back-and-forth conversation (multi-turn prompts), we find that the safety of open-source models degrades significantly.

KG-CTG: Citation Generation through Knowledge Graph-guided Large Language Models,"Avinash Anand, Mohit Gupta, Kritarth Prasad, Ujjwal Goel, Naman Lal, Astha Verma, Rajiv Ratn Shah","Citation Text Generation (CTG) is a task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to produce text that accurately cites or references a cited document within a source document. In CTG, the generated text draws upon contextual cues from both the source document and the cited paper, ensuring accurate and relevant citation information is provided. Previous work in the field of citation generation is mainly based on the text summarization of documents. Following this, this paper presents a framework, and a comparative study to demonstrate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task of citation generation.

Resilience of Large Language Models for Noisy Instructions,"Bin Wang, Chengwei Wei, Zhengyuan Liu, Geyu Lin, Nancy F. Chen","As the rapidly advancing domain of natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting human commands and generating text across various tasks. Nonetheless, the resilience of LLMs to handle text containing inherent errors, stemming from human interactions and collaborative systems, has not been thoroughly explored. Our study investigates the resilience of LLMs against five common types of disruptions including 1) ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) errors, 2) OCR (Optical Character Recognition) errors, 3) grammatical mistakes, 4) typographical errors, and 5) distractive content. We aim to investigate how these models react by deliberately embedding these errors into instructions. Our findings reveal that while some LLMs show a degree of resistance to certain types of noise, their overall performance significantly suffers. This emphasizes the importance of further investigation into enhancing model resilience. In response to the observed decline in performance, our study also evaluates a ""re-pass"" strategy, designed to purify the instructions of noise before the LLMs process them.

The first factor maintains a small infinity norm, while the second exhibits a similarly constrained norm when multiplied by an orthogonal matrix. Surprisingly, the entries of factors after decomposition are well-concentrated around several peaks, which allows us to efficiently replace them with corresponding centroids for quantization purposes. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed approach and rigorously evaluate our compression algorithm in the context of next-word prediction tasks and on a set of downstream tasks for text classification.

Unveiling Imitation Learning: Exploring the Impact of Data Falsity to Large Language Model,Hyunsoo Cho,"Many recent studies endeavor to improve open-source language models through imitation learning, and re-training on the synthetic instruction data from state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. However, the innate nature of synthetic data inherently contains noisy data, giving rise to a substantial presence of low-quality data replete with erroneous responses, and flawed reasoning. Although we intuitively grasp the potential harm of noisy data, we lack a quantitative understanding of its impact. To this end, this paper explores the correlation between the degree of noise and its impact on language models through instruction tuning. We first introduce the Falsity-Controllable (FACO) dataset, which comprises pairs of true answers with corresponding reasoning, as well as false pairs to manually control the falsity ratio of the dataset.Through our extensive experiments, we found multiple intriguing findings of the correlation between the factuality of the dataset and instruction tuning: Specifically, we verified falsity of the instruction is highly relevant to various benchmark scores. Moreover, when LLMs are trained with false instructions, they learn to lie and generate fake unfaithful answers, even though they know the correct answer for the user request. Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance is possible, but it failed to reach full performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09717v1,2024-04
Are Large Language Models Reliable Argument Quality Annotators?,"Nailia Mirzakhmedova, Marcel Gohsen, Chia Hao Chang, Benno Stein","Evaluating the quality of arguments is a crucial aspect of any system leveraging argument mining. However, it is a challenge to obtain reliable and consistent annotations regarding argument quality, as this usually requires domain-specific expertise of the annotators. Even among experts, the assessment of argument quality is often inconsistent due to the inherent subjectivity of this task. In this paper, we study the potential of using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as proxies for argument quality annotators. To assess the capability of LLMs in this regard, we analyze the agreement between model, human expert, and human novice annotators based on an established taxonomy of argument quality dimensions. Our findings highlight that LLMs can produce consistent annotations, with a moderately high agreement with human experts across most of the quality dimensions. Moreover, we show that using LLMs as additional annotators can significantly improve the agreement between annotators. These results suggest that LLMs can serve as a valuable tool for automated argument quality assessment, thus streamlining and accelerating the evaluation of large argument datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09696v1,2024-04
LoRAP: Transformer Sub-Layers Deserve Differentiated Structured Compression for Large Language Models,"Guangyan Li, Yongqiang Tang, Wensheng Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) show excellent performance in difficult tasks, but they often require massive memories and computational resources. How to reduce the parameter scale of LLMs has become research hotspots. In this study, we make an important observation that the multi-head self-attention (MHA) sub-layer of Transformer exhibits noticeable low-rank structure, while the feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layer does not. With this regard, we design a mixed compression model, which organically combines Low-Rank matrix approximation And structured Pruning (LoRAP). For the MHA sub-layer, we propose an input activation weighted singular value decomposition method to strengthen the low-rank characteristic. Furthermore, we discover that the weight matrices in MHA sub-layer have different low-rank degrees. Thus, a novel parameter allocation scheme according to the discrepancy of low-rank degrees is devised. For the FFN sub-layer, we propose a gradient-free structured channel pruning method. During the pruning, we get an interesting finding that the least important 1% of parameter actually play a vital role in model performance. Extensive evaluations on zero-shot perplexity and zero-shot task classification indicate that our proposal is superior to previous structured compression rivals under multiple compression ratios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09695v1,2024-04
Harnessing GPT-4V(ision) for Insurance: A Preliminary Exploration,"Chenwei Lin, Hanjia Lyu, Jiebo Luo, Xian Xu","The emergence of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) marks a significant milestone in the development of artificial intelligence. Insurance, as a vast and complex discipline, involves a wide variety of data forms in its operational processes, including text, images, and videos, thereby giving rise to diverse multimodal tasks. Despite this, there has been limited systematic exploration of multimodal tasks specific to insurance, nor a thorough investigation into how LMMs can address these challenges. In this paper, we explore GPT-4V's capabilities in the insurance domain. We categorize multimodal tasks by focusing primarily on visual aspects based on types of insurance (e.g., auto, household/commercial property, health, and agricultural insurance) and insurance stages (e.g., risk assessment, risk monitoring, and claims processing). Our experiment reveals that GPT-4V exhibits remarkable abilities in insurance-related tasks, demonstrating not only a robust understanding of multimodal content in the insurance domain but also a comprehensive knowledge of insurance scenarios.

Multi-News+: Cost-efficient Dataset Cleansing via LLM-based Data Annotation,"Juhwan Choi, Jungmin Yun, Kyohoon Jin, YoungBin Kim","The quality of the dataset is crucial for ensuring optimal performance and reliability of downstream task models. However, datasets often contain noisy data inadvertently included during the construction process. Numerous attempts have been made to correct this issue through human annotators. However, hiring and managing human annotators is expensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, recent studies are exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) for data annotation.   In this study, we present a case study that extends the application of LLM-based data annotation to enhance the quality of existing datasets through a cleansing strategy. Specifically, we leverage approaches such as chain-of-thought and majority voting to imitate human annotation and classify unrelated documents from the Multi-News dataset, which is widely used for the multi-document summarization task. Through our proposed cleansing method, we introduce an enhanced Multi-News+. By employing LLMs for data cleansing, we demonstrate an efficient and effective approach to improving dataset quality without relying on expensive human annotation efforts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09682v3,2024-04
Towards Compositionally Generalizable Semantic Parsing in Large Language Models: A Survey,Amogh Mannekote,"Compositional generalization is the ability of a model to generalize to complex, previously unseen types of combinations of entities from just having seen the primitives. This type of generalization is particularly relevant to the semantic parsing community for applications such as task-oriented dialogue, text-to-SQL parsing, and information retrieval, as they can harbor infinite complexity. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in a wide range of NLP tasks, unlocking perfect compositional generalization still remains one of the few last unsolved frontiers. The past few years has seen a surge of interest in works that explore the limitations of, methods to improve, and evaluation metrics for compositional generalization capabilities of LLMs for semantic parsing tasks. In this work, we present a literature survey geared at synthesizing recent advances in analysis, methods, and evaluation schemes to offer a starting point for both practitioners and researchers in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13074v1,2024-04
Learn Your Reference Model for Real Good Alignment,"Alexey Gorbatovski, Boris Shaposhnikov, Alexey Malakhov, Nikita Surnachev, Yaroslav Aksenov, Ian Maksimov, Nikita Balagansky, Daniil Gavrilov","Despite the fact that offline methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment do not require a direct reward model, they remain susceptible to overoptimization. This issue arises when the trained model deviates excessively from the reference policy, leading to a decrease in sample quality. We propose a new paradigm of offline alignment methods, called Trust Region (including variants TR-DPO, TR-IPO, TR-KTO), which dynamically updates the reference policy throughout the training process. Our results show that TR alignment methods effectively mitigate overoptimization, enabling models to maintain strong performance even when substantially deviating from the initial reference policy. We demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches not only through toy examples that exhibit reduced overoptimization, but also through direct, side-by-side comparisons in specific tasks such as helpful and harmless dialogue, as well as summarization, where they surpass conventional methods. Additionally, we report significant improvements in general-purpose assistant setups with the Llama3 model on the AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of Trust Region methods over classical approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09656v3,2024-04
Real-world Instance-specific Image Goal Navigation: Bridging Domain Gaps via Contrastive Learning,"Taichi Sakaguchi, Akira Taniguchi, Yoshinobu Hagiwara, Lotfi El Hafi, Shoichi Hasegawa, Tadahiro Taniguchi","Improving instance-specific image goal navigation (InstanceImageNav), which locates the identical object in a real-world environment from a query image, is essential for robotic systems to assist users in finding desired objects. The challenge lies in the domain gap between low-quality images observed by the moving robot, characterized by motion blur and low-resolution, and high-quality query images provided by the user. Such domain gaps could significantly reduce the task success rate but have not been the focus of previous work. To address this, we propose a novel method called Few-shot Cross-quality Instance-aware Adaptation (CrossIA), which employs contrastive learning with an instance classifier to align features between massive low- and few high-quality images. This approach effectively reduces the domain gap by bringing the latent representations of cross-quality images closer on an instance basis. Additionally, the system integrates an object image collection with a pre-trained deblurring model to enhance the observed image quality. Our method fine-tunes the SimSiam model, pre-trained on ImageNet, using CrossIA. We evaluated our method's effectiveness through an InstanceImageNav task with 20 different types of instances, where the robot identifies the same instance in a real-world environment as a high-quality query image. Our experiments showed that our method improves the task success rate by up to three times compared to the baseline, a conventional approach based on SuperGlue. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging contrastive learning and image enhancement techniques to bridge the domain gap and improve object localization in robotic applications.

"If there's a Trigger Warning, then where's the Trigger? Investigating Trigger Warnings at the Passage Level","Matti Wiegmann, Jennifer Rakete, Magdalena Wolska, Benno Stein, Martin Potthast","Trigger warnings are labels that preface documents with sensitive content if this content could be perceived as harmful by certain groups of readers. Since warnings about a document intuitively need to be shown before reading it, authors usually assign trigger warnings at the document level. What parts of their writing prompted them to assign a warning, however, remains unclear. We investigate for the first time the feasibility of identifying the triggering passages of a document, both manually and computationally. We create a dataset of 4,135 English passages, each annotated with one of eight common trigger warnings. In a large-scale evaluation, we then systematically evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned and few-shot classifiers, and their generalizability. We find that trigger annotation belongs to the group of subjective annotation tasks in NLP, and that automatic trigger classification remains challenging but feasible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09615v1,2024-04
Improving Recall of Large Language Models: A Model Collaboration Approach for Relational Triple Extraction,"Zepeng Ding, Wenhao Huang, Jiaqing Liang, Deqing Yang, Yanghua Xiao","Relation triple extraction, which outputs a set of triples from long sentences, plays a vital role in knowledge acquisition. Large language models can accurately extract triples from simple sentences through few-shot learning or fine-tuning when given appropriate instructions. However, they often miss out when extracting from complex sentences. In this paper, we design an evaluation-filtering framework that integrates large language models with small models for relational triple extraction tasks. The framework includes an evaluation model that can extract related entity pairs with high precision. We propose a simple labeling principle and a deep neural network to build the model, embedding the outputs as prompts into the extraction process of the large model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method can assist large language models in obtaining more accurate extraction results, especially from complex sentences containing multiple relational triples. Our evaluation model can also be embedded into traditional extraction models to enhance their extraction precision from complex sentences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09593v1,2024-04
Modelling Language,Jumbly Grindrod,"This paper argues that large language models have a valuable scientific role to play in serving as scientific models of a language. Linguistic study should not only be concerned with the cognitive processes behind linguistic competence, but also with language understood as an external, social entity. Once this is recognized, the value of large language models as scientific models becomes clear. This paper defends this position against a number of arguments to the effect that language models provide no linguistic insight. It also draws upon recent work in philosophy of science to show how large language models could serve as scientific models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09579v1,2024-04

(2017), is at the heart of the remarkable recent progress in the development of language models, including widely-used chatbots such as Chat-GPT and Claude. In this paper, I argue that we can extract from the way the transformer architecture works a theory of the relationship between context and meaning. I call this the transformer theory, and I argue that it is novel with regard to two related philosophical debates: the contextualism debate regarding the extent of context-sensitivity across natural language, and the polysemy debate regarding how polysemy should be captured within an account of word meaning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09577v2,2024-04
Large language models and linguistic intentionality,Jumbly Grindrod,"Do large language models like Chat-GPT or LLaMa meaningfully use the words they produce? Or are they merely clever prediction machines, simulating language use by producing statistically plausible text? There have already been some initial attempts to answer this question by showing that these models meet the criteria for entering meaningful states according to metasemantic theories of mental content. In this paper, I will argue for a different approach - that we should instead consider whether language models meet the criteria given by our best metasemantic theories of linguistic content. In that vein, I will illustrate how this can be done by applying two such theories to the case of language models: Gareth Evans' (1982) account of naming practices and Ruth Millikan's (1984, 2004, 2005) teleosemantics. In doing so, I will argue that it is a mistake to think that the failure of LLMs to meet plausible conditions for mental intentionality thereby renders their outputs meaningless, and that a distinguishing feature of linguistic intentionality - dependency on a pre-existing linguistic system - allows for the plausible result LLM outputs are meaningful.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09576v2,2024-04
Reliability Estimation of News Media Sources: Birds of a Feather Flock Together,"Sergio Burdisso, Dairazalia Sánchez-Cortés, Esaú Villatoro-Tello, Petr Motlicek","Evaluating the reliability of news sources is a routine task for journalists and organizations committed to acquiring and disseminating accurate information. Recent research has shown that predicting sources' reliability represents an important first-prior step in addressing additional challenges such as fake news detection and fact-checking. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for source reliability estimation that leverages reinforcement learning strategies for estimating the reliability degree of news sources. Contrary to previous research, our proposed approach models the problem as the estimation of a reliability degree, and not a reliability label, based on how all the news media sources interact with each other on the Web. We validated the effectiveness of our method on a news media reliability dataset that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable existing datasets. Results show that the estimated reliability degrees strongly correlates with journalists-provided scores (Spearman=0.80) and can effectively predict reliability labels (macro-avg. F$_1$ score=81.05). We release our implementation and dataset, aiming to provide a valuable resource for the NLP community working on information verification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09565v1,2024-04
Prepacking: A Simple Method for Fast Prefilling and Increased Throughput in Large Language Models,"Siyan Zhao, Daniel Israel, Guy Van den Broeck, Aditya Grover","During inference for transformer-based large language models (LLM), prefilling is the computation of the key-value (KV) cache for input tokens in the prompt prior to autoregressive generation. For longer input prompt lengths, prefilling will incur a significant overhead on decoding time. In this work, we highlight the following pitfall of prefilling: for batches containing high-varying prompt lengths, significant computation is wasted by the standard practice of padding sequences to the maximum length. As LLMs increasingly support longer context lengths, potentially up to 10 million tokens, variations in prompt lengths within a batch become more pronounced. To address this, we propose Prepacking, a simple yet effective method to optimize prefilling computation. To avoid redundant computation on pad tokens, prepacking combines prompts of varying lengths into a sequence and packs multiple sequences into a compact batch using a bin-packing algorithm. It then modifies the attention mask and positional encoding to compute multiple prefilled KV-caches for multiple prompts within a single sequence. On standard curated dataset containing prompts with varying lengths, we obtain a significant speed and memory efficiency improvements as compared to the default padding-based prefilling computation within Huggingface across a range of base model configurations and inference serving scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09529v1,2024-04
State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey,"Xiao Wang, Shiao Wang, Yuhe Ding, Yuehang Li, Wentao Wu, Yao Rong, Weizhe Kong, Ju Huang, Shihao Li, Haoxiang Yang, Ziwen Wang, Bo Jiang, Chenglong Li, Yaowei Wang, Yonghong Tian, Jin Tang","In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM.

Bridging the Gap between Different Vocabularies for LLM Ensemble,"Yangyifan Xu, Jinliang Lu, Jiajun Zhang","Ensembling different large language models (LLMs) to unleash their complementary potential and harness their individual strengths is highly valuable. Nevertheless, vocabulary discrepancies among various LLMs have constrained previous studies to either selecting or blending completely generated outputs. This limitation hinders the dynamic correction and enhancement of outputs during the generation process, resulting in a limited capacity for effective ensemble. To address this issue, we propose a novel method to Ensemble LLMs via Vocabulary Alignment (EVA). EVA bridges the lexical gap among various LLMs, enabling meticulous ensemble at each generation step. Specifically, we first learn mappings between the vocabularies of different LLMs with the assistance of overlapping tokens. Subsequently, these mappings are employed to project output distributions of LLMs into a unified space, facilitating a fine-grained ensemble. Finally, we design a filtering strategy to exclude models that generate unfaithful tokens. Experimental results on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, and data-to-text generation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with individual LLMs and previous ensemble methods conducted on complete outputs. Further analyses confirm that our approach can leverage knowledge from different language models and yield consistent improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09492v1,2024-04
MMCode: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Code Generation with Visually Rich Programming Problems,"Kaixin Li, Yuchen Tian, Qisheng Hu, Ziyang Luo, Zhiyong Huang, Jing Ma","Programming often involves converting detailed and complex specifications into code, a process during which developers typically utilize visual aids to more effectively convey concepts. While recent developments in Large Multimodal Models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in visual reasoning and mathematical tasks, there is little work on investigating whether these models can effectively interpret visual elements for code generation. To this end, we present MMCode, the first multi-modal coding dataset for evaluating algorithmic problem-solving skills in visually rich contexts. MMCode contains 3,548 questions and 6,620 images collected from real-world programming challenges harvested from 10 code competition websites, presenting significant challenges due to the extreme demand for reasoning abilities. Our experiment results show that current state-of-the-art models struggle to solve these problems.

Mitigating Hallucination in Abstractive Summarization with Domain-Conditional Mutual Information,"Kyubyung Chae, Jaepill Choi, Yohan Jo, Taesup Kim","A primary challenge in abstractive summarization is hallucination -- the phenomenon where a model generates plausible text that is absent in the source text. We hypothesize that the domain (or topic) of the source text triggers the model to generate text that is highly probable in the domain, neglecting the details of the source text. To alleviate this model bias, we introduce a decoding strategy based on domain-conditional pointwise mutual information. This strategy adjusts the generation probability of each token by comparing it with the token's marginal probability within the domain of the source text. According to evaluation on the XSUM dataset, our method demonstrates improvement in terms of faithfulness and source relevance.

Modeling Emotions and Ethics with Large Language Models,Edward Y. Chang,"This paper explores the integration of human-like emotions and ethical considerations into Large Language Models (LLMs). We first model eight fundamental human emotions, presented as opposing pairs, and employ collaborative LLMs to reinterpret and express these emotions across a spectrum of intensity. Our focus extends to embedding a latent ethical dimension within LLMs, guided by a novel self-supervised learning algorithm with human feedback (SSHF). This approach enables LLMs to perform self-evaluations and adjustments concerning ethical guidelines, enhancing their capability to generate content that is not only emotionally resonant but also ethically aligned. The methodologies and case studies presented herein illustrate the potential of LLMs to transcend mere text and image generation, venturing into the realms of empathetic interaction and principled decision-making, thereby setting a new precedent in the development of emotionally aware and ethically conscious AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13071v2,2024-04

Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) as the core technology, we propose a method for the automatic construction of case knowledge graphs for judicial cases. Our approach centers on two fundamental NLP tasks: entity recognition and relationship extraction. We compare two pre-trained models for entity recognition to establish their efficacy. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task semantic relationship extraction model that incorporates translational embedding, leading to a nuanced contextualized case knowledge representation. Specifically, in a case study involving a ""Motor Vehicle Traffic Accident Liability Dispute,"" our approach significantly outperforms the baseline model. The entity recognition F1 score improved by 0.36, while the relationship extraction F1 score increased by 2.37.

In our study, we collect training and inference requirements for various LLMs. We then analyze the economic strengths of nations and organizations in the context of developing and serving these models. Additionally, we also look at whether individuals around the world can access and use this emerging technology.

Towards Practical Tool Usage for Continually Learning LLMs,"Jerry Huang, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Sarath Chandar","Large language models (LLMs) show an innate skill for solving language based tasks. But insights have suggested an inability to adjust for information or task-solving skills becoming outdated, as their knowledge, stored directly within their parameters, remains static in time. Tool use helps by offloading work to systems that the LLM can access through an interface, but LLMs that use them still must adapt to nonstationary environments for prolonged use, as new tools can emerge and existing tools can change. Nevertheless, tools require less specialized knowledge, therefore we hypothesize they are better suited for continual learning (CL) as they rely less on parametric memory for solving tasks and instead focus on learning when to apply pre-defined tools. To verify this, we develop a synthetic benchmark and follow this by aggregating existing NLP tasks to form a more realistic testing scenario. While we demonstrate scaling model size is not a solution, regardless of tool usage, continual learning techniques can enable tool LLMs to both adapt faster while forgetting less, highlighting their potential as continual learners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09339v1,2024-04
Entropy Guided Extrapolative Decoding to Improve Factuality in Large Language Models,"Souvik Das, Lifeng Jin, Linfeng Song, Haitao Mi, Baolin Peng, Dong Yu","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive natural language capabilities but suffer from hallucination -- generating content ungrounded in the realities of training data. Recent work has focused on decoding techniques to improve factuality during inference by leveraging LLMs' hierarchical representation of factual knowledge, manipulating the predicted distributions at inference time. Current state-of-the-art approaches refine decoding by contrasting early-exit distributions from a lower layer with the final layer to exploit information related to factuality within the model forward procedure. However, such methods often assume the final layer is the most reliable and the lower layer selection process depends on it. In this work, we first propose extrapolation of critical token probabilities beyond the last layer for more accurate contrasting. We additionally employ layer-wise entropy-guided lower layer selection, decoupling the selection process from the final layer. Experiments demonstrate strong performance - surpassing state-of-the-art on multiple different datasets by large margins.

Self-Selected Attention Span for Accelerating Large Language Model Inference,"Tian Jin, Wanzin Yazar, Zifei Xu, Sayeh Sharify, Xin Wang","Large language models (LLMs) can solve challenging tasks. However, their inference computation on modern GPUs is highly inefficient due to the increasing number of tokens they must attend to as they generate new ones. To address this inefficiency, we capitalize on LLMs' problem-solving capabilities to optimize their own inference-time efficiency. We demonstrate with two specific tasks: (a) evaluating complex arithmetic expressions and (b) summarizing news articles. For both tasks, we create custom datasets to fine-tune an LLM. The goal of fine-tuning is twofold: first, to make the LLM learn to solve the evaluation or summarization task, and second, to train it to identify the minimal attention spans required for each step of the task. As a result, the fine-tuned model is able to convert these self-identified minimal attention spans into sparse attention masks on-the-fly during inference. We develop a custom CUDA kernel to take advantage of the reduced context to attend to. We demonstrate that using this custom CUDA kernel improves the throughput of LLM inference by 28%. Our work presents an end-to-end demonstration showing that training LLMs to self-select their attention spans speeds up autoregressive inference in solving real-world tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09336v1,2024-04
"Large Language Models are as persuasive as humans, but how? About the cognitive effort and moral-emotional language of LLM arguments",Carlos Carrasco-Farre,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are already as persuasive as humans. However, we know very little about how they do it. This paper investigates the persuasion strategies of LLMs, comparing them with human-generated arguments. Using a dataset of 1,251 participants in an experiment, we analyze the persuasion strategies of LLM-generated and human-generated arguments using measures of cognitive effort (lexical and grammatical complexity) and moral-emotional language (sentiment and moral analysis). The study reveals that LLMs produce arguments that require higher cognitive effort, exhibiting more complex grammatical and lexical structures than human counterparts. Additionally, LLMs demonstrate a significant propensity to engage more deeply with moral language, utilizing both positive and negative moral foundations more frequently than humans. In contrast with previous research, no significant difference was found in the emotional content produced by LLMs and humans. These findings contribute to the discourse on AI and persuasion, highlighting the dual potential of LLMs to both enhance and undermine informational integrity through communication strategies for digital persuasion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09329v2,2024-04
Reap the Wild Wind: Detecting Media Storms in Large-Scale News Corpora,"Dror K. Markus, Effi Levi, Tamir Sheafer, Shaul R. Shenhav","Media Storms, dramatic outbursts of attention to a story, are central components of media dynamics and the attention landscape. Despite their significance, there has been little systematic and empirical research on this concept due to issues of measurement and operationalization. We introduce an iterative human-in-the-loop method to identify media storms in a large-scale corpus of news articles. The text is first transformed into signals of dispersion based on several textual characteristics. In each iteration, we apply unsupervised anomaly detection to these signals; each anomaly is then validated by an expert to confirm the presence of a storm, and those results are then used to tune the anomaly detection in the next iteration. We demonstrate the applicability of this method in two scenarios: first, supplementing an initial list of media storms within a specific time frame; and second, detecting media storms in new time periods. We make available a media storm dataset compiled using both scenarios. Both the method and dataset offer the basis for comprehensive empirical research into the concept of media storms, including characterizing them and predicting their outbursts and durations, in mainstream media or social media platforms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09299v1,2024-04
Cross-Data Knowledge Graph Construction for LLM-enabled Educational Question-Answering System: A Case Study at HCMUT,"Tuan Bui, Oanh Tran, Phuong Nguyen, Bao Ho, Long Nguyen, Thang Bui, Tho Quan","In today's rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a vibrant research topic. LLMs find applications in various fields and contribute significantly. Despite their powerful language capabilities, similar to pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs still face challenges in remembering events, incorporating new information, and addressing domain-specific issues or hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, some others have proposed the integration of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to provide factual context, thereby improving performance and delivering more accurate feedback to user queries.   Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress. With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education. Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day. Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc. Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task. This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09296v2,2024-04

TrafficVLM: A Controllable Visual Language Model for Traffic Video Captioning,"Quang Minh Dinh, Minh Khoi Ho, Anh Quan Dang, Hung Phong Tran","Traffic video description and analysis have received much attention recently due to the growing demand for efficient and reliable urban surveillance systems. Most existing methods only focus on locating traffic event segments, which severely lack descriptive details related to the behaviour and context of all the subjects of interest in the events. In this paper, we present TrafficVLM, a novel multi-modal dense video captioning model for vehicle ego camera view. TrafficVLM models traffic video events at different levels of analysis, both spatially and temporally, and generates long fine-grained descriptions for the vehicle and pedestrian at different phases of the event. We also propose a conditional component for TrafficVLM to control the generation outputs and a multi-task fine-tuning paradigm to enhance TrafficVLM's learning capability. Experiments show that TrafficVLM performs well on both vehicle and overhead camera views. Our solution achieved outstanding results in Track 2 of the AI City Challenge 2024, ranking us third in the challenge standings.

JaFIn: Japanese Financial Instruction Dataset,"Kota Tanabe, Masahiro Suzuki, Hiroki Sakaji, Itsuki Noda","We construct an instruction dataset for the large language model (LLM) in the Japanese finance domain. Domain adaptation of language models, including LLMs, is receiving more attention as language models become more popular. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation through instruction tuning. To achieve this, we propose an instruction tuning data in Japanese called JaFIn, the Japanese Financial Instruction Dataset. JaFIn is manually constructed based on multiple data sources, including Japanese government websites, which provide extensive financial knowledge. We then utilize JaFIn to apply instruction tuning for several LLMs, demonstrating that our models specialized in finance have better domain adaptability than the original models. The financial-specialized LLMs created were evaluated using a quantitative Japanese financial benchmark and qualitative response comparisons, showing improved performance over the originals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09260v2,2024-04
Test Code Generation for Telecom Software Systems using Two-Stage Generative Model,"Mohamad Nabeel, Doumitrou Daniil Nimara, Tahar Zanouda","In recent years, the evolution of Telecom towards achieving intelligent, autonomous, and open networks has led to an increasingly complex Telecom Software system, supporting various heterogeneous deployment scenarios, with multi-standard and multi-vendor support. As a result, it becomes a challenge for large-scale Telecom software companies to develop and test software for all deployment scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for Automated Test Generation for large-scale Telecom Software systems. We begin by generating Test Case Input data for test scenarios observed using a time-series Generative model trained on historical Telecom Network data during field trials. Additionally, the time-series Generative model helps in preserving the privacy of Telecom data. The generated time-series software performance data are then utilized with test descriptions written in natural language to generate Test Script using the Generative Large Language Model. Our comprehensive experiments on public datasets and Telecom datasets obtained from operational Telecom Networks demonstrate that the framework can effectively generate comprehensive test case data input and useful test code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09249v1,2024-04
Knowledgeable Agents by Offline Reinforcement Learning from Large Language Model Rollouts,"Jing-Cheng Pang, Si-Hang Yang, Kaiyuan Li, Jiaji Zhang, Xiong-Hui Chen, Nan Tang, Yang Yu","Reinforcement learning (RL) trains agents to accomplish complex tasks through environmental interaction data, but its capacity is also limited by the scope of the available data. To obtain a knowledgeable agent, a promising approach is to leverage the knowledge from large language models (LLMs). Despite previous studies combining LLMs with RL, seamless integration of the two components remains challenging due to their semantic gap. This paper introduces a novel method, Knowledgeable Agents from Language Model Rollouts (KALM), which extracts knowledge from LLMs in the form of imaginary rollouts that can be easily learned by the agent through offline reinforcement learning methods. The primary challenge of KALM lies in LLM grounding, as LLMs are inherently limited to textual data, whereas environmental data often comprise numerical vectors unseen to LLMs. To address this, KALM fine-tunes the LLM to perform various tasks based on environmental data, including bidirectional translation between natural language descriptions of skills and their corresponding rollout data. This grounding process enhances the LLM's comprehension of environmental dynamics, enabling it to generate diverse and meaningful imaginary rollouts that reflect novel skills. Initial empirical evaluations on the CLEVR-Robot environment demonstrate that KALM enables agents to complete complex rephrasings of task goals and extend their capabilities to novel tasks requiring unprecedented optimal behaviors. KALM achieves a success rate of 46% in executing tasks with unseen goals, substantially surpassing the 26% success rate achieved by baseline methods. Furthermore, KALM effectively enables the LLM to comprehend environmental dynamics, resulting in the generation of meaningful imaginary rollouts that reflect novel skills and demonstrate the seamless integration of large language models and reinforcement learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09248v1,2024-04
Exploring and Improving Drafts in Blockwise Parallel Decoding,"Taehyeon Kim, Ananda Theertha Suresh, Kishore Papineni, Michael Riley, Sanjiv Kumar, Adrian Benton","Despite the remarkable strides made by autoregressive language models, their potential is often hampered by the slow inference speeds inherent in sequential token generation. Blockwise parallel decoding (BPD) was proposed by Stern et al. as a method to improve inference speed of language models by simultaneously predicting multiple future tokens, termed block drafts, which are subsequently verified and conditionally accepted by the autoregressive model. This paper contributes to the understanding and improvement of block drafts in two ways. First, we analyze the token distributions produced by multiple prediction heads. Secondly, we leverage this analysis to develop algorithms to improve BPD inference speed by refining the block drafts using n-gram and neural language models. Experiments demonstrate that refined block drafts yield a +5-21% increase in block efficiency (i.e., the number of accepted tokens from the block draft) across diverse datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09221v2,2024-04
Compass: Large Multilingual Language Model for South-east Asia,Sophia Maria,"Large language models have exhibited significant proficiency in languages endowed with extensive linguistic resources, such as English and Chinese. Nevertheless, their effectiveness notably diminishes when applied to languages characterized by limited linguistic resources, particularly within the Southeast Asian linguistic landscape, such as Indonesian. The scarcity of linguistic resources for these languages presents challenges associated with inadequate training, restricted vocabulary coverage, and challenging evaluation processes. In response to these exigencies, we have introduced CompassLLM, a large multilingual model specifically tailored for Southeast Asian languages, with the primary aim of supporting the developmental requirements of Shopee. Our methodology encompasses several key strategies. To progressively enhance multilingual proficiencies, we implemented a multi-stage pre-training strategy integrated with curriculum learning, gradually intensifying the focus on low-resource languages. Concurrently, to better accommodate low-resource human instructions, we curated and generated a repository of high-quality multilingual human instructions, culminating the CompassLLM-SFT model through supervised instruction fine-tuning. Finally, to reinforce the model's alignment with human preference behaviors, we have embraced the principle of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to obtain CompassLLM-DPO model. Preliminary evaluation of the CompassLLM model yields promising results, with our model surpassing benchmark models like Vicuna-7b-v1.5, Sealion, Falcon and SeaLLM, across diverse evaluation tasks, as verified through both automated and human-driven assessments. Notably, our model exhibits its superior performance in South-east Asia languages, such as Indonesian language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09220v1,2024-04

This paper presents a novel data augmentation technique to improve model robustness for biomedical natural language inference in clinical trials. By generating synthetic examples through semantic perturbations and domain-specific vocabulary replacement and adding a new task for numerical and quantitative reasoning, we introduce greater diversity and reduce shortcut learning. Our approach, combined with multi-task learning and the DeBERTa architecture, achieved significant performance gains on the NLI4CT 2024 benchmark compared to the original language models. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each augmentation method in improving robustness. Our best-performing model ranked 12th in terms of faithfulness and 8th in terms of consistency, respectively, out of the 32 participants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09206v1,2024-04
TransformerFAM: Feedback attention is working memory,"Dongseong Hwang, Weiran Wang, Zhuoyuan Huo, Khe Chai Sim, Pedro Moreno Mengibar","While Transformers have revolutionized deep learning, their quadratic attention complexity hinders their ability to process infinitely long inputs. We propose Feedback Attention Memory (FAM), a novel Transformer architecture that leverages a feedback loop to enable the network to attend to its own latent representations. This design fosters the emergence of working memory within the Transformer, allowing it to process indefinitely long sequences. TransformerFAM requires no additional weights, enabling seamless integration with pre-trained models. Our experiments show that TransformerFAM significantly improves Transformer performance on long-context tasks across various model sizes (1B, 8B, and 24B). These results showcase the potential to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) to process sequences of unlimited length.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09173v3,2024-04
Distilling Reasoning Ability from Large Language Models with Adaptive Thinking,"Xiaoshu Chen, Sihang Zhou, Ke Liang, Xinwang Liu","Chain of thought finetuning (cot-finetuning) aims to endow small language models (SLM) with reasoning ability to improve their performance towards specific tasks by allowing them to imitate the reasoning procedure of large language models (LLM) beyond simply predicting the answers. Most existing cot-finetuning methods adopt a pre-thinking mechanism, allowing the SLM to generate a rationale before providing an answer. This mechanism enables SLM to analyze and think about complex questions, but it also makes answer correctness highly sensitive to minor errors in rationale. Therefore, we propose a robust post-thinking mechanism to generate answers before rationale. Thanks to this answer-first setting, 1) the answer can escape from the adverse effects caused by minor errors in the rationale; 2) the rationale serves as an error amplifier to the answer, which makes the SLM focus on learning hard samples; 3) the inferring efficiency can also benefit from the setting since users can stop the generation right after answers are outputted when inference is conducted. However, although the post-thinking mechanism brings many advantages and improves the overall performance of SLM on specific tasks, it may lose the ability to think about the questions and decompose complex questions into simple sub-questions compared to pre-thinking mechanism. Therefore, a plug-and-play adaptive-thinking mechanism is proposed with the aid of the soft prompt tuning to integrate the merits of the pre-thinking mechanism and post-thinking mechanism, in which a perception module is introduced to adaptively prompt SLM answer or think first based on perceiving the complexity of the questions. Extensive experiments are conducted across 12 reasoning tasks and 2 representative language models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09170v5,2024-04
Evaluation and Improvement of Fault Detection for Large Language Models,"Qiang Hu, Jin Wen, Maxime Cordy, Yuheng Huang, Wei Ma, Xiaofei Xie, Lei Ma","Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved significant success across various application domains, garnering substantial attention from different communities. Unfortunately, even for the best LLM, many \textit{faults} still exist that LLM cannot properly predict. Such faults will harm the usability of LLMs in general and could introduce safety issues in reliability-critical systems such as autonomous driving systems. How to quickly reveal these faults in real-world datasets that LLM could face is important, but challenging. The major reason is that the ground truth is necessary but the data labeling process is heavy considering the time and human effort. To handle this problem, in the conventional deep learning testing field, test selection methods have been proposed for efficiently evaluating deep learning models by prioritizing faults. However, despite their importance, the usefulness of these methods on LLMs is unclear, and lack of exploration. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to investigate the effectiveness of existing fault detection methods for LLMs. Experimental results on four different tasks~(including both code tasks and natural language processing tasks) and four LLMs~(e.g., LLaMA3 and GPT4) demonstrated that simple methods such as Margin perform well on LLMs but there is still a big room for improvement. Based on the study, we further propose \textbf{MuCS}, a prompt \textbf{Mu}tation-based prediction \textbf{C}onfidence \textbf{S}moothing framework to boost the fault detection capability of existing methods. Concretely, multiple prompt mutation techniques have been proposed to help collect more diverse outputs for confidence smoothing. The results show that our proposed framework significantly enhances existing methods with the improvement of test relative coverage by up to 70.53\%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14419v2,2024-04
GeMQuAD : Generating Multilingual Question Answering Datasets from Large Language Models using Few Shot Learning,"Amani Namboori, Shivam Mangale, Andy Rosenbaum, Saleh Soltan","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with capabilities like In-Context Learning (ICL) has ushered in new possibilities for data generation across various domains while minimizing the need for extensive data collection and modeling techniques. Researchers have explored ways to use this generated synthetic data to optimize smaller student models for reduced deployment costs and lower latency in downstream tasks. However, ICL-generated data often suffers from low quality as the task specificity is limited with few examples used in ICL. In this paper, we propose GeMQuAD - a semi-supervised learning approach, extending the WeakDAP framework, applied to a dataset generated through ICL with just one example in the target language using AlexaTM 20B Seq2Seq LLM. Through our approach, we iteratively identify high-quality data to enhance model performance, especially for low-resource multilingual setting in the context of Extractive Question Answering task. Our framework outperforms the machine translation-augmented model by 0.22/1.68 F1/EM (Exact Match) points for Hindi and 0.82/1.37 F1/EM points for Spanish on the MLQA dataset, and it surpasses the performance of model trained on an English-only dataset by 5.05/6.50 F1/EM points for Hindi and 3.81/3.69 points F1/EM for Spanish on the same dataset. Notably, our approach uses a pre-trained LLM for generation with no fine-tuning (FT), utilizing just a single annotated example in ICL to generate data, providing a cost-effective development process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09163v1,2024-04
Mitigating Heterogeneity among Factor Tensors via Lie Group Manifolds for Tensor Decomposition Based Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Jiang Li, Xiangdong Su, Yeyun Gong, Guanglai Gao","Recent studies have highlighted the effectiveness of tensor decomposition methods in the Temporal Knowledge Graphs Embedding (TKGE) task. However, we found that inherent heterogeneity among factor tensors in tensor decomposition significantly hinders the tensor fusion process and further limits the performance of link prediction. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel method that maps factor tensors onto a unified smooth Lie group manifold to make the distribution of factor tensors approximating homogeneous in tensor decomposition. We provide the theoretical proof of our motivation that homogeneous tensors are more effective than heterogeneous tensors in tensor fusion and approximating the target for tensor decomposition based TKGE methods. The proposed method can be directly integrated into existing tensor decomposition based TKGE methods without introducing extra parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the heterogeneity and in enhancing the tensor decomposition based TKGE models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09155v1,2024-04
ToNER: Type-oriented Named Entity Recognition with Generative Language Model,"Guochao Jiang, Ziqin Luo, Yuchen Shi, Dixuan Wang, Jiaqing Liang, Deqing Yang","In recent years, the fine-tuned generative models have been proven more powerful than the previous tagging-based or span-based models on named entity recognition (NER) task. It has also been found that the information related to entities, such as entity types, can prompt a model to achieve NER better. However, it is not easy to determine the entity types indeed existing in the given sentence in advance, and inputting too many potential entity types would distract the model inevitably. To exploit entity types' merit on promoting NER task, in this paper we propose a novel NER framework, namely ToNER based on a generative model. In ToNER, a type matching model is proposed at first to identify the entity types most likely to appear in the sentence. Then, we append a multiple binary classification task to fine-tune the generative model's encoder, so as to generate the refined representation of the input sentence. Moreover, we add an auxiliary task for the model to discover the entity types which further fine-tunes the model to output more accurate results. Our extensive experiments on some NER benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in ToNER that are oriented towards entity types' exploitation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09145v2,2024-04
From Bytes to Borsch: Fine-Tuning Gemma and Mistral for the Ukrainian Language Representation,"Artur Kiulian, Anton Polishko, Mykola Khandoga, Oryna Chubych, Jack Connor, Raghav Ravishankar, Adarsh Shirawalmath","In the rapidly advancing field of AI and NLP, generative large language models (LLMs) stand at the forefront of innovation, showcasing unparalleled abilities in text understanding and generation. However, the limited representation of low-resource languages like Ukrainian poses a notable challenge, restricting the reach and relevance of this technology. Our paper addresses this by fine-tuning the open-source Gemma and Mistral LLMs with Ukrainian datasets, aiming to improve their linguistic proficiency and benchmarking them against other existing models capable of processing Ukrainian language. This endeavor not only aims to mitigate language bias in technology but also promotes inclusivity in the digital realm. Our transparent and reproducible approach encourages further NLP research and development. Additionally, we present the Ukrainian Knowledge and Instruction Dataset (UKID) to aid future efforts in language model fine-tuning. Our research not only advances the field of NLP but also highlights the importance of linguistic diversity in AI, which is crucial for cultural preservation, education, and expanding AI's global utility.

Unveiling LLM Evaluation Focused on Metrics: Challenges and Solutions,"Taojun Hu, Xiao-Hua Zhou","Natural Language Processing (NLP) is witnessing a remarkable breakthrough driven by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs have gained significant attention across academia and industry for their versatile applications in text generation, question answering, and text summarization. As the landscape of NLP evolves with an increasing number of domain-specific LLMs employing diverse techniques and trained on various corpus, evaluating performance of these models becomes paramount. To quantify the performance, it's crucial to have a comprehensive grasp of existing metrics. Among the evaluation, metrics which quantifying the performance of LLMs play a pivotal role. This paper offers a comprehensive exploration of LLM evaluation from a metrics perspective, providing insights into the selection and interpretation of metrics currently in use. Our main goal is to elucidate their mathematical formulations and statistical interpretations. We shed light on the application of these metrics using recent Biomedical LLMs. Additionally, we offer a succinct comparison of these metrics, aiding researchers in selecting appropriate metrics for diverse tasks. The overarching goal is to furnish researchers with a pragmatic guide for effective LLM evaluation and metric selection, thereby advancing the understanding and application of these large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09135v1,2024-04
When Hindsight is Not 20/20: Testing Limits on Reflective Thinking in Large Language Models,"Yanhong Li, Chenghao Yang, Allyson Ettinger","Recent studies suggest that self-reflective prompting can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the use of external feedback as a stop criterion raises doubts about the true extent of LLMs' ability to emulate human-like self-reflection. In this paper, we set out to clarify these capabilities under a more stringent evaluation setting in which we disallow any kind of external feedback. Our findings under this setting show a split: while self-reflection enhances performance in TruthfulQA, it adversely affects results in HotpotQA. We conduct follow-up analyses to clarify the contributing factors in these patterns, and find that the influence of self-reflection is impacted both by reliability of accuracy in models' initial responses, and by overall question difficulty: specifically, self-reflection shows the most benefit when models are less likely to be correct initially, and when overall question difficulty is higher. We also find that self-reflection reduces tendency toward majority voting. Based on our findings, we propose guidelines for decisions on when to implement self-reflection. We release the codebase for reproducing our experiments at https://github.com/yanhong-lbh/LLM-SelfReflection-Eval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09129v1,2024-04
Confidence Calibration and Rationalization for LLMs via Multi-Agent Deliberation,"Ruixin Yang, Dheeraj Rajagopal, Shirley Anugrah Hayati, Bin Hu, Dongyeop Kang","Uncertainty estimation is a significant issue for current large language models (LLMs) that are generally poorly calibrated and over-confident, especially with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Unlike humans, whose decisions and confidences not only stem from intrinsic beliefs but can also be adjusted through daily observations, existing calibration methods for LLMs focus on estimating or eliciting individual confidence without taking full advantage of the ""Collective Wisdom"": the interaction among multiple LLMs that can collectively improve both accuracy and calibration. In this work, we propose Collaborative Calibration, a post-hoc training-free calibration strategy that leverages the collaborative and expressive capabilities of multiple tool-augmented LLM agents in a simulated group deliberation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Collaborative Calibration on generative QA tasks across various domains, showing its potential in harnessing the rationalization of collectively calibrated confidence assessments and improving the reliability of model predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09127v3,2024-04
Provable Interactive Learning with Hindsight Instruction Feedback,"Dipendra Misra, Aldo Pacchiano, Robert E. Schapire","We study interactive learning in a setting where the agent has to generate a response (e.g., an action or trajectory) given a context and an instruction. In contrast, to typical approaches that train the system using reward or expert supervision on response, we study learning with hindsight instruction where a teacher provides an instruction that is most suitable for the agent's generated response. This hindsight labeling of instruction is often easier to provide than providing expert supervision of the optimal response which may require expert knowledge or can be impractical to elicit. We initiate the theoretical analysis of interactive learning with hindsight labeling. We first provide a lower bound showing that in general, the regret of any algorithm must scale with the size of the agent's response space. We then study a specialized setting where the underlying instruction-response distribution can be decomposed as a low-rank matrix. We introduce an algorithm called LORIL for this setting and show that its regret scales as $\sqrt{T}$ where $T$ is the number of rounds and depends on the intrinsic rank but does not depend on the size of the agent's response space. We provide experiments in two domains showing that LORIL outperforms baselines even when the low-rank assumption is violated.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09123v1,2024-04

CuriousLLM: Elevating Multi-Document QA with Reasoning-Infused Knowledge Graph Prompting,"Zukang Yang, Zixuan Zhu","In the field of Question Answering (QA), unifying large language models (LLMs) with external databases has shown great success. However, these methods often fall short in providing the advanced reasoning needed for complex QA tasks. To address these issues, we improve over a novel approach called Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP), which combines knowledge graphs with a LLM-based agent to improve reasoning and search accuracy. Nevertheless, the original KGP framework necessitates costly fine-tuning with large datasets yet still suffers from LLM hallucination. Therefore, we propose a reasoning-infused LLM agent to enhance this framework. This agent mimics human curiosity to ask follow-up questions to more efficiently navigate the search. This simple modification significantly boosts the LLM performance in QA tasks without the high costs and latency associated with the initial KGP framework. Our ultimate goal is to further develop this approach, leading to more accurate, faster, and cost-effective solutions in the QA domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09077v1,2024-04
CodeCloak: A Method for Evaluating and Mitigating Code Leakage by LLM Code Assistants,"Amit Finkman Noah, Avishag Shapira, Eden Bar Kochva, Inbar Maimon, Dudu Mimran, Yuval Elovici, Asaf Shabtai","LLM-based code assistants are becoming increasingly popular among developers. These tools help developers improve their coding efficiency and reduce errors by providing real-time suggestions based on the developer's codebase. While beneficial, the use of these tools can inadvertently expose the developer's proprietary code to the code assistant service provider during the development process. In this work, we propose a method to mitigate the risk of code leakage when using LLM-based code assistants. CodeCloak is a novel deep reinforcement learning agent that manipulates the prompts before sending them to the code assistant service. CodeCloak aims to achieve the following two contradictory goals: (i) minimizing code leakage, while (ii) preserving relevant and useful suggestions for the developer. Our evaluation, employing StarCoder and Code Llama, LLM-based code assistants models, demonstrates CodeCloak's effectiveness on a diverse set of code repositories of varying sizes, as well as its transferability across different models. We also designed a method for reconstructing the developer's original codebase from code segments sent to the code assistant service (i.e., prompts) during the development process, to thoroughly analyze code leakage risks and evaluate the effectiveness of CodeCloak under practical development scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09066v3,2024-04
Multilingual Evaluation of Semantic Textual Relatedness,"Sharvi Endait, Srushti Sonavane, Ridhima Sinare, Pritika Rohera, Advait Naik, Dipali Kadam","The explosive growth of online content demands robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that can capture nuanced meanings and cultural context across diverse languages. Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) goes beyond superficial word overlap, considering linguistic elements and non-linguistic factors like topic, sentiment, and perspective. Despite its pivotal role, prior NLP research has predominantly focused on English, limiting its applicability across languages. Addressing this gap, our paper dives into capturing deeper connections between sentences beyond simple word overlap. Going beyond English-centric NLP research, we explore STR in Marathi, Hindi, Spanish, and English, unlocking the potential for information retrieval, machine translation, and more. Leveraging the SemEval-2024 shared task, we explore various language models across three learning paradigms: supervised, unsupervised, and cross-lingual. Our comprehensive methodology gains promising results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Adapting Mental Health Prediction Tasks for Cross-lingual Learning via Meta-Training and In-context Learning with Large Language Model,"Zita Lifelo, Huansheng Ning, Sahraoui Dhelim","Timely identification is essential for the efficient handling of mental health illnesses such as depression. However, the current research fails to adequately address the prediction of mental health conditions from social media data in low-resource African languages like Swahili. This study introduces two distinct approaches utilising model-agnostic meta-learning and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address this gap. Experiments are conducted on three datasets translated to low-resource language and applied to four mental health tasks, which include stress, depression, depression severity and suicidal ideation prediction. we first apply a meta-learning model with self-supervision, which results in improved model initialisation for rapid adaptation and cross-lingual transfer. The results show that our meta-trained model performs significantly better than standard fine-tuning methods, outperforming the baseline fine-tuning in macro F1 score with 18\% and 0.8\% over XLM-R and mBERT. In parallel, we use LLMs' in-context learning capabilities to assess their performance accuracy across the Swahili mental health prediction tasks by analysing different cross-lingual prompting approaches. Our analysis showed that Swahili prompts performed better than cross-lingual prompts but less than English prompts. Our findings show that in-context learning can be achieved through cross-lingual transfer through carefully crafted prompt templates with examples and instructions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09045v1,2024-04
Do LLMs Play Dice? Exploring Probability Distribution Sampling in Large Language Models for Behavioral Simulation,"Jia Gu, Liang Pang, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng","With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) for handling complex language tasks, an increasing number of studies are employing LLMs as agents to emulate the sequential decision-making processes of humans often represented as Markov decision-making processes (MDPs). The actions in MDPs adhere to specific probability distributions and require iterative sampling. This arouses curiosity regarding the capacity of LLM agents to comprehend probability distributions, thereby guiding the agent's behavioral decision-making through probabilistic sampling and generating behavioral sequences. To answer the above question, we divide the problem into two main aspects: sequence simulation with known probability distribution and sequence simulation with unknown probability distribution. Our analysis indicates that LLM agents can understand probabilities, but they struggle with probability sampling. Their ability to perform probabilistic sampling can be improved to some extent by integrating coding tools, but this level of sampling precision still makes it difficult to simulate human behavior as agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09043v3,2024-04
MING-MOE: Enhancing Medical Multi-Task Learning in Large Language Models with Sparse Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts,"Yusheng Liao, Shuyang Jiang, Yu Wang, Yanfeng Wang","Large language models like ChatGPT have shown substantial progress in natural language understanding and generation, proving valuable across various disciplines, including the medical field. Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks which often require multi-task learning capabilities. Previous approaches, although beneficial, fall short in real-world applications because they necessitate task-specific annotations at inference time, limiting broader generalization. This paper introduces MING-MOE, a novel Mixture-of-Expert~(MOE)-based medical large language model designed to manage diverse and complex medical tasks without requiring task-specific annotations, thus enhancing its usability across extensive datasets. MING-MOE employs a Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MoLoRA) technique, allowing for efficient parameter usage by maintaining base model parameters static while adapting through a minimal set of trainable parameters. We demonstrate that MING-MOE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on over 20 medical tasks, illustrating a significant improvement over existing models. This approach not only extends the capabilities of medical language models but also improves inference efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09027v1,2024-04

Towards Efficient Resume Understanding: A Multi-Granularity Multi-Modal Pre-Training Approach,"Feihu Jiang, Chuan Qin, Jingshuai Zhang, Kaichun Yao, Xi Chen, Dazhong Shen, Chen Zhu, Hengshu Zhu, Hui Xiong","In the contemporary era of widespread online recruitment, resume understanding has been widely acknowledged as a fundamental and crucial task, which aims to extract structured information from resume documents automatically. Compared to the traditional rule-based approaches, the utilization of recently proposed pre-trained document understanding models can greatly enhance the effectiveness of resume understanding. The present approaches have, however, disregarded the hierarchical relations within the structured information presented in resumes, and have difficulty parsing resumes in an efficient manner. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel model, namely ERU, to achieve efficient resume understanding. Specifically, we first introduce a layout-aware multi-modal fusion transformer for encoding the segments in the resume with integrated textual, visual, and layout information. Then, we design three self-supervised tasks to pre-train this module via a large number of unlabeled resumes. Next, we fine-tune the model with a multi-granularity sequence labeling task to extract structured information from resumes. Finally, extensive experiments on a real-world dataset clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of ERU.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13067v1,2024-04
WikiSplit++: Easy Data Refinement for Split and Rephrase,"Hayato Tsukagoshi, Tsutomu Hirao, Makoto Morishita, Katsuki Chousa, Ryohei Sasano, Koichi Takeda","The task of Split and Rephrase, which splits a complex sentence into multiple simple sentences with the same meaning, improves readability and enhances the performance of downstream tasks in natural language processing (NLP). However, while Split and Rephrase can be improved using a text-to-text generation approach that applies encoder-decoder models fine-tuned with a large-scale dataset, it still suffers from hallucinations and under-splitting. To address these issues, this paper presents a simple and strong data refinement approach. Here, we create WikiSplit++ by removing instances in WikiSplit where complex sentences do not entail at least one of the simpler sentences and reversing the order of reference simple sentences. Experimental results show that training with WikiSplit++ leads to better performance than training with WikiSplit, even with fewer training instances. In particular, our approach yields significant gains in the number of splits and the entailment ratio, a proxy for measuring hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09002v1,2024-04

From an annotation standpoint, we additionally introduce a new hierarchy of morphotactic tagsets. Finally, we develop \modelname, a discriminative morphological segmentation system that, contrary to previous work, explicitly models morphotactics. We show that \textsc{chipmunk} yields improved performance on three tasks for all six languages: (i) morphological segmentation, (ii) stemming and (iii) morphological tag classification. On morphological segmentation, our method shows absolute improvements of 2--6 points $F_1$ over the baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08997v1,2024-04
RoNID: New Intent Discovery with Generated-Reliable Labels and Cluster-friendly Representations,"Shun Zhang, Chaoran Yan, Jian Yang, Changyu Ren, Jiaqi Bai, Tongliang Li, Zhoujun Li","New Intent Discovery (NID) strives to identify known and reasonably deduce novel intent groups in the open-world scenario. But current methods face issues with inaccurate pseudo-labels and poor representation learning, creating a negative feedback loop that degrades overall model performance, including accuracy and the adjusted rand index. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Robust New Intent Discovery (RoNID) framework optimized by an EM-style method, which focuses on constructing reliable pseudo-labels and obtaining cluster-friendly discriminative representations. RoNID comprises two main modules: reliable pseudo-label generation module and cluster-friendly representation learning module. Specifically, the pseudo-label generation module assigns reliable synthetic labels by solving an optimal transport problem in the E-step, which effectively provides high-quality supervised signals for the input of the cluster-friendly representation learning module. To learn cluster-friendly representation with strong intra-cluster compactness and large inter-cluster separation, the representation learning module combines intra-cluster and inter-cluster contrastive learning in the M-step to feed more discriminative features into the generation module. RoNID can be performed iteratively to ultimately yield a robust model with reliable pseudo-labels and cluster-friendly representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our method brings substantial improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of +1~+4 points.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08977v2,2024-04
OOVs in the Spotlight: How to Inflect them?,"Tomáš Sourada, Jana Straková, Rudolf Rosa","We focus on morphological inflection in out-of-vocabulary (OOV) conditions, an under-researched subtask in which state-of-the-art systems usually are less effective. We developed three systems: a retrograde model and two sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on LSTM and Transformer. For testing in OOV conditions, we automatically extracted a large dataset of nouns in the morphologically rich Czech language, with lemma-disjoint data splits, and we further manually annotated a real-world OOV dataset of neologisms. In the standard OOV conditions, Transformer achieves the best results, with increasing performance in ensemble with LSTM, the retrograde model and SIGMORPHON baselines. On the real-world OOV dataset of neologisms, the retrograde model outperforms all neural models. Finally, our seq2seq models achieve state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 16 languages from SIGMORPHON 2022 shared task data in the OOV evaluation (feature overlap) in the large data condition. We release the Czech OOV Inflection Dataset for rigorous evaluation in OOV conditions. Further, we release the inflection system with the seq2seq models as a ready-to-use Python library.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08974v2,2024-04
AMU-Tuning: Effective Logit Bias for CLIP-based Few-shot Learning,"Yuwei Tang, Zhenyi Lin, Qilong Wang, Pengfei Zhu, Qinghua Hu","Recently, pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown great potential in few-shot learning and attracted a lot of research interest. Although efforts have been made to improve few-shot ability of CLIP, key factors on the effectiveness of existing methods have not been well studied, limiting further exploration of CLIP's potential in few-shot learning. In this paper, we first introduce a unified formulation to analyze CLIP-based few-shot learning methods from a perspective of logit bias, which encourages us to learn an effective logit bias for further improving performance of CLIP-based few-shot learning methods. To this end, we disassemble three key components involved in computation of logit bias (i.e., logit features, logit predictor, and logit fusion) and empirically analyze the effect on performance of few-shot classification. Based on analysis of key components, this paper proposes a novel AMU-Tuning method to learn effective logit bias for CLIP-based few-shot classification. Specifically, our AMU-Tuning predicts logit bias by exploiting the appropriate $\underline{\textbf{A}}$uxiliary features, which are fed into an efficient feature-initialized linear classifier with $\underline{\textbf{M}}$ulti-branch training. Finally, an $\underline{\textbf{U}}$ncertainty-based fusion is developed to incorporate logit bias into CLIP for few-shot classification. The experiments are conducted on several widely used benchmarks, and the results show AMU-Tuning clearly outperforms its counterparts while achieving state-of-the-art performance of CLIP-based few-shot learning without bells and whistles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08958v1,2024-04
Multimodal Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution Using Linear Semantic Transfer and Mixed-Modality Ensembles,"Abhijnan Nath, Huma Jamil, Shafiuddin Rehan Ahmed, George Baker, Rahul Ghosh, James H. Martin, Nathaniel Blanchard, Nikhil Krishnaswamy","Event coreference resolution (ECR) is the task of determining whether distinct mentions of events within a multi-document corpus are actually linked to the same underlying occurrence. Images of the events can help facilitate resolution when language is ambiguous. Here, we propose a multimodal cross-document event coreference resolution method that integrates visual and textual cues with a simple linear map between vision and language models. As existing ECR benchmark datasets rarely provide images for all event mentions, we augment the popular ECB+ dataset with event-centric images scraped from the internet and generated using image diffusion models. We establish three methods that incorporate images and text for coreference: 1) a standard fused model with finetuning, 2) a novel linear mapping method without finetuning and 3) an ensembling approach based on splitting mention pairs by semantic and discourse-level difficulty. We evaluate on 2 datasets: the augmented ECB+, and AIDA Phase 1. Our ensemble systems using cross-modal linear mapping establish an upper limit (91.9 CoNLL F1) on ECB+ ECR performance given the preprocessing assumptions used, and establish a novel baseline on AIDA Phase 1. Our results demonstrate the utility of multimodal information in ECR for certain challenging coreference problems, and highlight a need for more multimodal resources in the coreference resolution space.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08949v1,2024-04
Introducing Super RAGs in Mistral 8x7B-v1,"Ayush Thakur, Raghav Gupta","The relentless pursuit of enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the advent of Super Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Super RAGs), a novel approach designed to elevate the performance of LLMs by integrating external knowledge sources with minimal structural modifications.

Enforcing Paraphrase Generation via Controllable Latent Diffusion,"Wei Zou, Ziyuan Zhuang, Shujian Huang, Jia Liu, Jiajun Chen","Paraphrase generation aims to produce high-quality and diverse utterances of a given text. Though state-of-the-art generation via the diffusion model reconciles generation quality and diversity, textual diffusion suffers from a truncation issue that hinders efficiency and quality control. In this work, we propose \textit{L}atent \textit{D}iffusion \textit{P}araphraser~(LDP), a novel paraphrase generation by modeling a controllable diffusion process given a learned latent space. LDP achieves superior generation efficiency compared to its diffusion counterparts. It facilitates only input segments to enforce paraphrase semantics, which further improves the results without external features. Experiments show that LDP achieves improved and diverse paraphrase generation compared to baselines. Further analysis shows that our method is also helpful to other similar text generations and domain adaptations.

Leveraging Large Language Model as Simulated Patients for Clinical Education,"Yanzeng Li, Cheng Zeng, Jialun Zhong, Ruoyu Zhang, Minhao Zhang, Lei Zou","Simulated Patients (SPs) play a crucial role in clinical medical education by providing realistic scenarios for student practice. However, the high cost of training and hiring qualified SPs, along with the heavy workload and potential risks they face in consistently portraying actual patients, limit students' access to this type of clinical training. Consequently, the integration of computer program-based simulated patients has emerged as a valuable educational tool in recent years. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their exceptional capabilities in conversational artificial intelligence and role-playing have been demonstrated, making them a feasible option for implementing Virtual Simulated Patient (VSP). In this paper, we present an integrated model-agnostic framework called CureFun that harnesses the potential of LLMs in clinical medical education. This framework facilitates natural conversations between students and simulated patients, evaluates their dialogue, and provides suggestions to enhance students' clinical inquiry skills. Through comprehensive evaluations, our approach demonstrates more authentic and professional SP-scenario dialogue flows compared to other LLM-based chatbots, thus proving its proficiency in simulating patients. Additionally, leveraging CureFun's evaluation ability, we assess several medical LLMs and discuss the possibilities and limitations of using LLMs as virtual doctors from the perspective of their diagnostic abilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13066v2,2024-04

Towards Enhancing Health Coaching Dialogue in Low-Resource Settings,"Yue Zhou, Barbara Di Eugenio, Brian Ziebart, Lisa Sharp, Bing Liu, Ben Gerber, Nikolaos Agadakos, Shweta Yadav","Health coaching helps patients identify and accomplish lifestyle-related goals, effectively improving the control of chronic diseases and mitigating mental health conditions. However, health coaching is cost-prohibitive due to its highly personalized and labor-intensive nature. In this paper, we propose to build a dialogue system that converses with the patients, helps them create and accomplish specific goals, and can address their emotions with empathy. However, building such a system is challenging since real-world health coaching datasets are limited and empathy is subtle. Thus, we propose a modularized health coaching dialogue system with simplified NLU and NLG frameworks combined with mechanism-conditioned empathetic response generation. Through automatic and human evaluation, we show that our system generates more empathetic, fluent, and coherent responses and outperforms the state-of-the-art in NLU tasks while requiring less annotation. We view our approach as a key step towards building automated and more accessible health coaching systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08888v1,2024-04
EIVEN: Efficient Implicit Attribute Value Extraction using Multimodal LLM,"Henry Peng Zou, Gavin Heqing Yu, Ziwei Fan, Dan Bu, Han Liu, Peng Dai, Dongmei Jia, Cornelia Caragea","In e-commerce, accurately extracting product attribute values from multimodal data is crucial for improving user experience and operational efficiency of retailers. However, previous approaches to multimodal attribute value extraction often struggle with implicit attribute values embedded in images or text, rely heavily on extensive labeled data, and can easily confuse similar attribute values. To address these issues, we introduce EIVEN, a data- and parameter-efficient generative framework that pioneers the use of multimodal LLM for implicit attribute value extraction. EIVEN leverages the rich inherent knowledge of a pre-trained LLM and vision encoder to reduce reliance on labeled data. We also introduce a novel Learning-by-Comparison technique to reduce model confusion by enforcing attribute value comparison and difference identification. Additionally, we construct initial open-source datasets for multimodal implicit attribute value extraction. Our extensive experiments reveal that EIVEN significantly outperforms existing methods in extracting implicit attribute values while requiring less labeled data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08886v1,2024-04
Is Next Token Prediction Sufficient for GPT? Exploration on Code Logic Comprehension,"Mengnan Qi, Yufan Huang, Yongqiang Yao, Maoquan Wang, Bin Gu, Neel Sundaresan","Large language models (LLMs) has experienced exponential growth, they demonstrate remarkable performance across various tasks. Notwithstanding, contemporary research primarily centers on enhancing the size and quality of pretraining data, still utilizing the next token prediction task on autoregressive transformer model structure. The efficacy of this task in truly facilitating the model's comprehension of code logic remains questionable, we speculate that it still interprets code as mere text, while human emphasizes the underlying logical knowledge. In order to prove it, we introduce a new task, ""Logically Equivalent Code Selection,"" which necessitates the selection of logically equivalent code from a candidate set, given a query code. Our experimental findings indicate that current LLMs underperform in this task, since they understand code by unordered bag of keywords. To ameliorate their performance, we propose an advanced pretraining task, ""Next Token Prediction+"". This task aims to modify the sentence embedding distribution of the LLM without sacrificing its generative capabilities. Our experimental results reveal that following this pretraining, both Code Llama and StarCoder, the prevalent code domain pretraining models, display significant improvements on our logically equivalent code selection task and the code completion task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08885v1,2024-04
Aligning the Objective of LLM-based Program Repair,"Junjielong Xu, Ying Fu, Shin Hwei Tan, Pinjia He","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations.   In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08877v4,2024-04
LLM In-Context Recall is Prompt Dependent,"Daniel Machlab, Rick Battle","The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the critical importance of conducting thorough evaluations to discern their comparative advantages, limitations, and optimal use cases. Particularly important is assessing their capacity to accurately retrieve information included in a given prompt. A model's ability to do this significantly influences how effectively it can utilize contextual details, thus impacting its practical efficacy and dependability in real-world applications.   Our research analyzes the in-context recall performance of various LLMs using the needle-in-a-haystack method. In this approach, a factoid (the ""needle"") is embedded within a block of filler text (the ""haystack""), which the model is asked to retrieve. We assess the recall performance of each model across various haystack lengths and with varying needle placements to identify performance patterns. This study demonstrates that an LLM's recall capability is not only contingent upon the prompt's content but also may be compromised by biases in its training data. Conversely, adjustments to model architecture, training strategy, or fine-tuning can improve performance. Our analysis provides insight into LLM behavior, offering direction for the development of more effective applications of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08865v1,2024-04
On Speculative Decoding for Multimodal Large Language Models,"Mukul Gagrani, Raghavv Goel, Wonseok Jeon, Junyoung Park, Mingu Lee, Christopher Lott","Inference with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is slow due to their large-language-model backbone which suffers from memory bandwidth bottleneck and generates tokens auto-regressively. In this paper, we explore the application of speculative decoding to enhance the inference efficiency of MLLMs, specifically the LLaVA 7B model. We show that a language-only model can serve as a good draft model for speculative decoding with LLaVA 7B, bypassing the need for image tokens and their associated processing components from the draft model. Our experiments across three different tasks show that speculative decoding can achieve a memory-bound speedup of up to 2.37$\times$ using a 115M parameter language model that we trained from scratch. Additionally, we introduce a compact LLaVA draft model incorporating an image adapter, which shows marginal performance gains in image captioning while maintaining comparable results in other tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08856v1,2024-04
Experimental Design for Active Transductive Inference in Large Language Models,"Subhojyoti Mukherjee, Anusha Lalitha, Aniket Deshmukh, Ge Liu, Yifei Ma, Branislav Kveton","One emergent ability of large language models (LLMs) is that query-specific examples can be included in the prompt at inference time. In this work, we use active learning for adaptive prompt design and call it Active In-context Prompt Design (AIPD). We design the LLM prompt by adaptively choosing few-shot examples from a training set to optimize performance on a test set. The training examples are initially unlabeled and we obtain the label of the most informative ones, which maximally reduces uncertainty in the LLM prediction. We propose two algorithms, GO and SAL, which differ in how the few-shot examples are chosen. We analyze these algorithms in linear models: first GO and then use its equivalence with SAL. We experiment with many different tasks in small, medium-sized, and large language models; and show that GO and SAL outperform other methods for choosing few-shot examples in the LLM prompt at inference time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08846v2,2024-04

Constrained C-Test Generation via Mixed-Integer Programming,"Ji-Ung Lee, Marc E. Pfetsch, Iryna Gurevych","This work proposes a novel method to generate C-Tests; a deviated form of cloze tests (a gap filling exercise) where only the last part of a word is turned into a gap. In contrast to previous works that only consider varying the gap size or gap placement to achieve locally optimal solutions, we propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach. This allows us to consider gap size and placement simultaneously, achieving globally optimal solutions, and to directly integrate state-of-the-art models for gap difficulty prediction into the optimization problem. A user study with 40 participants across four C-Test generation strategies (including GPT-4) shows that our approach (MIP) significantly outperforms two of the baseline strategies (based on gap placement and GPT-4); and performs on-par with the third (based on gap size). Our analysis shows that GPT-4 still struggles to fulfill explicit constraints during generation and that MIP produces C-Tests that correlate best with the perceived difficulty. We publish our code, model, and collected data consisting of 32 English C-Tests with 20 gaps each (totaling 3,200 individual gap responses) under an open source license.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08821v1,2024-04
The Illusion of State in State-Space Models,"William Merrill, Jackson Petty, Ashish Sabharwal","State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a potential alternative architecture for building large language models (LLMs) compared to the previously ubiquitous transformer architecture. One theoretical weakness of transformers is that they cannot express certain kinds of sequential computation and state tracking (Merrill & Sabharwal, 2023), which SSMs are explicitly designed to address via their close architectural similarity to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over transformers) in expressive power for state tracking? Surprisingly, the answer is no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs is limited very similarly to transformers: SSMs cannot express computation outside the complexity class $\mathsf{TC}^0$. In particular, this means they cannot solve simple state-tracking problems like permutation composition. It follows that SSMs are provably unable to accurately track chess moves with certain notation, evaluate code, or track entities in a long narrative. To supplement our formal analysis, we report experiments showing that Mamba-style SSMs indeed struggle with state tracking. Thus, despite its recurrent formulation, the ""state"" in an SSM is an illusion: SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08819v2,2024-04

Measuring the Quality of Answers in Political Q&As with Large Language Models,"R. Michael Alvarez, Jacob Morrier","This paper proposes a novel methodology for assessing the quality of answers in political question-and-answer sessions. Our approach consists of measuring the quality of an answer based on how accurately it can be identified among all observed answers given the question. This reflects the relevance and depth of engagement of the answer to the question. Similarly to semantic search, this measurement approach can be implemented by training a language model on the corpus of observed questions and answers without additional labeled data. We showcase and validate our methodology using data from the Question Period in the Canadian House of Commons. Our analysis reveals that while some answers have a weak semantic connection with questions, hinting at some evasion or obfuscation, answers are generally relevant, far surpassing what would be expected from random replies. Besides, our findings provide valuable insights into the correlates of answer quality. We find significant variations based on the party affiliation of the members of Parliament posing the questions. Finally, we uncover a meaningful correlation between the quality of answers and the topic of the questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08816v3,2024-04
CreativEval: Evaluating Creativity of LLM-Based Hardware Code Generation,"Matthew DeLorenzo, Vasudev Gohil, Jeyavijayan Rajendran","Large Language Models (LLMs) have proved effective and efficient in generating code, leading to their utilization within the hardware design process. Prior works evaluating LLMs' abilities for register transfer level code generation solely focus on functional correctness.

To address this research gap, we present CreativeEval, a framework for evaluating the creativity of LLMs within the context of generating hardware designs. We quantify four creative sub-components, fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration, through various prompting and post-processing techniques. We then evaluate multiple popular LLMs (including GPT models, CodeLlama, and VeriGen) upon this creativity metric, with results indicating GPT-3.5 as the most creative model in generating hardware designs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08806v1,2024-04

JailbreakLens: Visual Analysis of Jailbreak Attacks Against Large Language Models,"Yingchaojie Feng, Zhizhang Chen, Zhining Kang, Sijia Wang, Minfeng Zhu, Wei Zhang, Wei Chen","The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has underscored concerns regarding their security vulnerabilities, notably against jailbreak attacks, where adversaries design jailbreak prompts to circumvent safety mechanisms for potential misuse. Addressing these concerns necessitates a comprehensive analysis of jailbreak prompts to evaluate LLMs' defensive capabilities and identify potential weaknesses. However, the complexity of evaluating jailbreak performance and understanding prompt characteristics makes this analysis laborious. We collaborate with domain experts to characterize problems and propose an LLM-assisted framework to streamline the analysis process. It provides automatic jailbreak assessment to facilitate performance evaluation and support analysis of components and keywords in prompts. Based on the framework, we design JailbreakLens, a visual analysis system that enables users to explore the jailbreak performance against the target model, conduct multi-level analysis of prompt characteristics, and refine prompt instances to verify findings. Through a case study, technical evaluations, and expert interviews, we demonstrate our system's effectiveness in helping users evaluate model security and identify model weaknesses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08793v1,2024-04
CATS: Contextually-Aware Thresholding for Sparsity in Large Language Models,"Donghyun Lee, Je-Yong Lee, Genghan Zhang, Mo Tiwari, Azalia Mirhoseini","Large Language Models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced AI applications, yet their deployment remains challenging due to their immense inference costs. Recent studies ameliorate the computational costs of LLMs by increasing their activation sparsity but suffer from significant performance degradation on downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce a new framework for sparsifying the activations of base LLMs and reducing inference costs, dubbed Contextually Aware Thresholding for Sparsity (CATS). CATS is relatively simple, easy to implement, and highly effective. At the heart of our framework is a new non-linear activation function. We demonstrate that CATS can be applied to various base models, including Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B, and outperforms existing sparsification techniques in downstream task performance. More precisely, CATS-based models often achieve downstream task performance within 1-2% of their base models without any fine-tuning and even at activation sparsity levels of 50%. Furthermore, CATS-based models converge faster and display better task performance than competing techniques when fine-tuning is applied. Finally, we develop a custom GPU kernel for efficient implementation of CATS that translates the activation of sparsity of CATS to real wall-clock time speedups. Our custom kernel implementation of CATS results in a ~15% improvement in wall-clock inference latency of token generation on both Llama-7B and Mistral-7B.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08763v4,2024-04
The Generation Gap: Exploring Age Bias in the Value Systems of Large Language Models,"Siyang Liu, Trish Maturi, Bowen Yi, Siqi Shen, Rada Mihalcea","We explore the alignment of values in Large Language Models (LLMs) with specific age groups, leveraging data from the World Value Survey across thirteen categories. Through a diverse set of prompts tailored to ensure response robustness, we find a general inclination of LLM values towards younger demographics, especially when compared to the US population. Although a general inclination can be observed, we also found that this inclination toward younger groups can be different across different value categories. Additionally, we explore the impact of incorporating age identity information in prompts and observe challenges in mitigating value discrepancies with different age cohorts. Our findings highlight the age bias in LLMs and provide insights for future work.

Inheritune: Training Smaller Yet More Attentive Language Models,"Sunny Sanyal, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Alexandros G. Dimakis, Sujay Sanghavi","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks, primarily due to the transformer architecture and its self-attention mechanism. However, we observe that in standard decoder-style LLMs, attention matrices degenerate to single-column for deeper layers. Layers in this state are unable to learn anything meaningful and mostly redundant; we refer to these as lazy layers. The goal of this paper is to train smaller models by eliminating this structural inefficiency without compromising performance.   Motivated by this observation, we propose Inheritune, a simple yet effective training recipe for developing smaller, high-performing language models. Smaller models trained with Inheritune, inherit early transformer layers from a larger pre-trained model, then retrain and progressively expand until they match or exceed the performance of the larger model. We demonstrate that Inheritune enables the training of various sizes of GPT-2 models on datasets like OpenWebText-9B and FineWeb_edu. Models trained with Inheritune, despite having significantly fewer layers, match or even surpass the performance of their larger counterparts. For instance, our 16-layer GPT-2 medium variant achieves comparable performance to the standard 24-layer GPT-2 medium model. Code is available at https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/LLM-Inheritune.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08634v2,2024-04
Is ChatGPT Transforming Academics' Writing Style?,"Mingmeng Geng, Roberto Trotta","Based on one million arXiv papers submitted from May 2018 to January 2024, we assess the textual density of ChatGPT's writing style in their abstracts through a statistical analysis of word frequency changes. Our model is calibrated and validated on a mixture of real abstracts and ChatGPT-modified abstracts (simulated data) after a careful noise analysis. The words used for estimation are not fixed but adaptive, including those with decreasing frequency. We find that large language models (LLMs), represented by ChatGPT, are having an increasing impact on arXiv abstracts, especially in the field of computer science, where the fraction of LLM-style abstracts is estimated to be approximately 35%, if we take the responses of GPT-3.5 to one simple prompt, ""revise the following sentences"", as a baseline. We conclude with an analysis of both positive and negative aspects of the penetration of LLMs into academics' writing style.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08627v2,2024-04
Synthetic Dataset Creation and Fine-Tuning of Transformer Models for Question Answering in Serbian,"Aleksa Cvetanović, Predrag Tadić","In this paper, we focus on generating a synthetic question answering (QA) dataset using an adapted Translate-Align-Retrieve method. Using this method, we created the largest Serbian QA dataset of more than 87K samples, which we name SQuAD-sr. To acknowledge the script duality in Serbian, we generated both Cyrillic and Latin versions of the dataset. We investigate the dataset quality and use it to fine-tune several pre-trained QA models. Best results were obtained by fine-tuning the BERTi\'c model on our Latin SQuAD-sr dataset, achieving 73.91% Exact Match and 82.97% F1 score on the benchmark XQuAD dataset, which we translated into Serbian for the purpose of evaluation. The results show that our model exceeds zero-shot baselines, but fails to go beyond human performance. We note the advantage of using a monolingual pre-trained model over multilingual, as well as the performance increase gained by using Latin over Cyrillic. By performing additional analysis, we show that questions about numeric values or dates are more likely to be answered correctly than other types of questions. Finally, we conclude that SQuAD-sr is of sufficient quality for fine-tuning a Serbian QA model, in the absence of a manually crafted and annotated dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08617v1,2024-04
Can LLMs substitute SQL? Comparing Resource Utilization of Querying LLMs versus Traditional Relational Databases,"Xiang Zhang, Khatoon Khedri, Reza Rawassizadeh","Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate or substitute different types of tasks in the software engineering process. This study evaluates the resource utilization and accuracy of LLM in interpreting and executing natural language queries against traditional SQL within relational database management systems. We empirically examine the resource utilization and accuracy of nine LLMs varying from 7 to 34 Billion parameters, including Llama2 7B, Llama2 13B, Mistral, Mixtral, Optimus-7B, SUS-chat-34B, platypus-yi-34b, NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B and Starling-LM-7B-alpha, using a small transaction dataset. Our findings indicate that using LLMs for database queries incurs significant energy overhead (even small and quantized models), making it an environmentally unfriendly approach. Therefore, we advise against replacing relational databases with LLMs due to their substantial resource utilization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08727v1,2024-04
Small Models Are (Still) Effective Cross-Domain Argument Extractors,"William Gantt, Aaron Steven White","Effective ontology transfer has been a major goal of recent work on event argument extraction (EAE). Two methods in particular -- question answering (QA) and template infilling (TI) -- have emerged as promising approaches to this problem. However, detailed explorations of these techniques' ability to actually enable this transfer are lacking. In this work, we provide such a study, exploring zero-shot transfer using both techniques on six major EAE datasets at both the sentence and document levels. Further, we challenge the growing reliance on LLMs for zero-shot extraction, showing that vastly smaller models trained on an appropriate source ontology can yield zero-shot performance superior to that of GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08579v1,2024-04

To address these challenges, we propose Mixture of Prefix Experts (MoPE) to establish connections between similar slots in different domains, which strengthens the model transfer performance in unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that MoPE-DST achieves the joint goal accuracy of 57.13% on MultiWOZ2.1 and 55.40% on SGD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08559v1,2024-04
RLHF Deciphered: A Critical Analysis of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for LLMs,"Shreyas Chaudhari, Pranjal Aggarwal, Vishvak Murahari, Tanmay Rajpurohit, Ashwin Kalyan, Karthik Narasimhan, Ameet Deshpande, Bruno Castro da Silva","State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for various tasks. However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08555v2,2024-04
VertAttack: Taking advantage of Text Classifiers' horizontal vision,Jonathan Rusert,"Text classification systems have continuously improved in performance over the years. However, nearly all current SOTA classifiers have a similar shortcoming, they process text in a horizontal manner. Vertically written words will not be recognized by a classifier. In contrast, humans are easily able to recognize and read words written both horizontally and vertically. Hence, a human adversary could write problematic words vertically and the meaning would still be preserved to other humans. We simulate such an attack, VertAttack. VertAttack identifies which words a classifier is reliant on and then rewrites those words vertically. We find that VertAttack is able to greatly drop the accuracy of 4 different transformer models on 5 datasets. For example, on the SST2 dataset, VertAttack is able to drop RoBERTa's accuracy from 94 to 13%. Furthermore, since VertAttack does not replace the word, meaning is easily preserved. We verify this via a human study and find that crowdworkers are able to correctly label 77% perturbed texts perturbed, compared to 81% of the original texts. We believe VertAttack offers a look into how humans might circumvent classifiers in the future and thus inspire a look into more robust algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08538v1,2024-04
"Online Safety Analysis for LLMs: a Benchmark, an Assessment, and a Path Forward","Xuan Xie, Jiayang Song, Zhehua Zhou, Yuheng Huang, Da Song, Lei Ma","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across numerous fields, their limited interpretability poses concerns regarding their safe operations from multiple aspects, e.g., truthfulness, robustness, and fairness. Recent research has started developing quality assurance methods for LLMs, introducing techniques such as offline detector-based or uncertainty estimation methods. However, these approaches predominantly concentrate on post-generation analysis, leaving the online safety analysis for LLMs during the generation phase an unexplored area. To bridge this gap, we conduct in this work a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of existing online safety analysis methods on LLMs. We begin with a pilot study that validates the feasibility of detecting unsafe outputs in the early generation process. Following this, we establish the first publicly available benchmark of online safety analysis for LLMs, including a broad spectrum of methods, models, tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Utilizing this benchmark, we extensively analyze the performance of state-of-the-art online safety analysis methods on both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses of individual methods and offers valuable insights into selecting the most appropriate method based on specific application scenarios and task requirements. Furthermore, we also explore the potential of using hybridization methods, i.e., combining multiple methods to derive a collective safety conclusion, to enhance the efficacy of online safety analysis for LLMs. Our findings indicate a promising direction for the development of innovative and trustworthy quality assurance methodologies for LLMs, facilitating their reliable deployments across diverse domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08517v1,2024-04

Efficient Interactive LLM Serving with Proxy Model-based Sequence Length Prediction,"Haoran Qiu, Weichao Mao, Archit Patke, Shengkun Cui, Saurabh Jha, Chen Wang, Hubertus Franke, Zbigniew T. Kalbarczyk, Tamer Başar, Ravishankar K. Iyer","Large language models (LLMs) have been driving a new wave of interactive AI applications across numerous domains. However, efficiently serving LLM inference requests is challenging due to their unpredictable execution times originating from the autoregressive nature of generative models. Existing LLM serving systems exploit first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling, suffering from head-of-line blocking issues. To address the non-deterministic nature of LLMs and enable efficient interactive LLM serving, we present a speculative shortest-job-first (SSJF) scheduler that uses a light proxy model to predict LLM output sequence lengths. Our open-source SSJF implementation does not require changes to memory management or batching strategies. Evaluations on real-world datasets and production workload traces show that SSJF reduces average job completion times by 30.5-39.6% and increases throughput by 2.2-3.6x compared to FCFS schedulers, across no batching, dynamic batching, and continuous batching settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08509v2,2024-04
Dataset Reset Policy Optimization for RLHF,"Jonathan D. Chang, Wenhao Zhan, Owen Oertell, Kianté Brantley, Dipendra Misra, Jason D. Lee, Wen Sun","Reinforcement Learning (RL) from Human Preference-based feedback is a popular paradigm for fine-tuning generative models, which has produced impressive models such as GPT-4 and Claude3 Opus. This framework often consists of two steps: learning a reward model from an offline preference dataset followed by running online RL to optimize the learned reward model. In this work, leveraging the idea of reset, we propose a new RLHF algorithm with provable guarantees. Motivated by the fact that offline preference dataset provides informative states (i.e., data that is preferred by the labelers), our new algorithm, Dataset Reset Policy Optimization (DR-PO), integrates the existing offline preference dataset into the online policy training procedure via dataset reset: it directly resets the policy optimizer to the states in the offline dataset, instead of always starting from the initial state distribution. In theory, we show that DR-PO learns to perform at least as good as any policy that is covered by the offline dataset under general function approximation with finite sample complexity. In experiments, we demonstrate that on both the TL;DR summarization and the Anthropic Helpful Harmful (HH) dataset, the generation from DR-PO is better than that from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direction Preference Optimization (DPO), under the metric of GPT4 win-rate.

Mitigating Language-Level Performance Disparity in mPLMs via Teacher Language Selection and Cross-lingual Self-Distillation,"Haozhe Zhao, Zefan Cai, Shuzheng Si, Liang Chen, Yufeng He, Kaikai An, Baobao Chang","Large-scale multilingual Pretrained Language Models (mPLMs) yield impressive performance on cross-language tasks, yet significant performance disparities exist across different languages within the same mPLM. Previous studies endeavored to narrow these disparities by supervise fine-tuning the mPLMs with multilingual data. However, obtaining labeled multilingual data is time-consuming, and fine-tuning mPLM with limited labeled multilingual data merely encapsulates the knowledge specific to the labeled data. Therefore, we introduce ALSACE to leverage the learned knowledge from the well-performing languages to guide under-performing ones within the same mPLM, eliminating the need for additional labeled multilingual data. Experiments show that ALSACE effectively mitigates language-level performance disparity across various mPLMs while showing the competitive performance on different multilingual NLU tasks, ranging from full resource to limited resource settings.

Thematic Analysis with Large Language Models: does it work with languages other than English? A targeted test in Italian,Stefano De Paoli,"This paper proposes a test to perform Thematic Analysis (TA) with Large Language Model (LLM) on data which is in a different language than English. While there has been initial promising work on using pre-trained LLMs for TA on data in English, we lack any tests on whether these models can reasonably perform the same analysis with good quality in other language. In this paper a test will be proposed using an open access dataset of semi-structured interviews in Italian. The test shows that a pre-trained model can perform such a TA on the data, also using prompts in Italian. A comparative test shows the model capacity to produce themes which have a good resemblance with those produced independently by human researchers. The main implication of this study is that pre-trained LLMs may thus be suitable to support analysis in multilingual situations, so long as the language is supported by the model used.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08488v1,2024-04

AdapterSwap: Continuous Training of LLMs with Data Removal and Access-Control Guarantees,"William Fleshman, Aleem Khan, Marc Marone, Benjamin Van Durme","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of completing knowledge intensive tasks by recalling information from a static pretraining corpus. Here we are concerned with LLMs in the context of evolving data requirements. For instance: batches of new data that are introduced periodically; subsets of data with user-based access controls; or requirements on dynamic removal of documents with guarantees that associated knowledge cannot be recalled. We wish to satisfy these requirements while at the same time ensuring a model does not forget old information when new data becomes available. To address these issues, we introduce AdapterSwap, a training and inference scheme that organizes knowledge from a data collection into a set of low-rank adapters, which are dynamically composed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate AdapterSwap's ability to support efficient continual learning, while also enabling organizations to have fine-grained control over data access and deletion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08417v1,2024-04

Exploring Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Multi-Label Text Classification,"Alexandre Audibert, Aurélien Gauffre, Massih-Reza Amini","Learning an effective representation in multi-label text classification (MLTC) is a significant challenge in NLP. This challenge arises from the inherent complexity of the task, which is shaped by two key factors: the intricate connections between labels and the widespread long-tailed distribution of the data. To overcome this issue, one potential approach involves integrating supervised contrastive learning with classical supervised loss functions. Although contrastive learning has shown remarkable performance in multi-class classification, its impact in the multi-label framework has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of supervised contrastive learning and its influence on representation in MLTC context. We emphasize the importance of considering long-tailed data distributions to build a robust representation space, which effectively addresses two critical challenges associated with contrastive learning that we identify: the ""lack of positives"" and the ""attraction-repulsion imbalance"". Building on this insight, we introduce a novel contrastive loss function for MLTC. It attains Micro-F1 scores that either match or surpass those obtained with other frequently employed loss functions, and demonstrates a significant improvement in Macro-F1 scores across three multi-label datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08720v1,2024-04
Look at the Text: Instruction-Tuned Language Models are More Robust Multiple Choice Selectors than You Think,"Xinpeng Wang, Chengzhi Hu, Bolei Ma, Paul Röttger, Barbara Plank","Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). One common way to evaluate the model response is to rank the candidate answers based on the log probability of the first token prediction. An alternative way is to examine the text output. Prior work has shown that first token probabilities lack robustness to changes in MCQ phrasing, and that first token probabilities do not match text answers for instruction-tuned models. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the robustness of text answers. We show that the text answers are more robust to question perturbations than the first token probabilities, when the first token answers mismatch the text answers. The difference in robustness increases as the mismatch rate becomes greater. As the mismatch reaches over 50\%, the text answer is more robust to option order changes than the debiased first token probabilities using state-of-the-art debiasing methods such as PriDe. Our findings provide further evidence for the benefits of text answer evaluation over first token probability evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08382v2,2024-04
Automatic Speech Recognition Advancements for Indigenous Languages of the Americas,"Monica Romero, Sandra Gomez, Ivan G. Torre","Indigenous languages are a fundamental legacy in the development of human communication, embodying the unique identity and culture of local communities in America. The Second AmericasNLP (Americas Natural Language Processing) Competition Track 1 of NeurIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems) 2022 proposed the task of training automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for five Indigenous languages: Quechua, Guarani, Bribri, Kotiria, and Wa'ikhana. In this paper, we describe the fine-tuning of a state-of-the-art ASR model for each target language, using approximately 36.65 h of transcribed speech data from diverse sources enriched with data augmentation methods. We systematically investigate, using a Bayesian search, the impact of the different hyperparameters on the Wav2vec2.0 XLS-R (Cross-Lingual Speech Representations) variants of 300 M and 1 B parameters. Our findings indicate that data and detailed hyperparameter tuning significantly affect ASR accuracy, but language complexity determines the final result. The Quechua model achieved the lowest character error rate (CER) (12.14), while the Kotiria model, despite having the most extensive dataset during the fine-tuning phase, showed the highest CER (36.59). Conversely, with the smallest dataset, the Guarani model achieved a CER of 15.59, while Bribri and Wa'ikhana obtained, respectively, CERs of 34.70 and 35.23. Additionally, Sobol' sensitivity analysis highlighted the crucial roles of freeze fine-tuning updates and dropout rates. We release our best models for each language, marking the first open ASR models for Wa'ikhana and Kotiria.

Improving Health Question Answering with Reliable and Time-Aware Evidence Retrieval,"Juraj Vladika, Florian Matthes","In today's digital world, seeking answers to health questions on the Internet is a common practice. However, existing question answering (QA) systems often rely on using pre-selected and annotated evidence documents, thus making them inadequate for addressing novel questions. Our study focuses on the open-domain QA setting, where the key challenge is to first uncover relevant evidence in large knowledge bases. By utilizing the common retrieve-then-read QA pipeline and PubMed as a trustworthy collection of medical research documents, we answer health questions from three diverse datasets. We modify different retrieval settings to observe their influence on the QA pipeline's performance, including the number of retrieved documents, sentence selection process, the publication year of articles, and their number of citations. Our results reveal that cutting down on the amount of retrieved documents and favoring more recent and highly cited documents can improve the final macro F1 score up to 10%. We discuss the results, highlight interesting examples, and outline challenges for future research, like managing evidence disagreement and crafting user-friendly explanations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08359v1,2024-04
PMB5: Gaining More Insight into Neural Semantic Parsing with Challenging Benchmarks,"Xiao Zhang, Chunliu Wang, Rik van Noord, Johan Bos","The Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB) serves as a corpus for semantic processing with a focus on semantic parsing and text generation. Currently, we witness an excellent performance of neural parsers and generators on the PMB. This might suggest that such semantic processing tasks have by and large been solved. We argue that this is not the case and that performance scores from the past on the PMB are inflated by non-optimal data splits and test sets that are too easy. In response, we introduce several changes. First, instead of the prior random split, we propose a more systematic splitting approach to improve the reliability of the standard test data. Second, except for the standard test set, we also propose two challenge sets: one with longer texts including discourse structure, and one that addresses compositional generalization. We evaluate five neural models for semantic parsing and meaning-to-text generation. Our results show that model performance declines (in some cases dramatically) on the challenge sets, revealing the limitations of neural models when confronting such challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08354v4,2024-04
FastSpell: the LangId Magic Spell,"Marta Bañón, Jaume Zaragoza-Bernabeu, Gema Ramírez-Sánchez, Sergio Ortiz-Rojas","Language identification is a crucial component in the automated production of language resources, particularly in multilingual and big data contexts.

This paper introduces FastSpell, a language identifier that combines fastText (a pre-trained language identifier tool) and Hunspell (a spell checker) with the aim of having a refined second-opinion before deciding which language should be assigned to a text. We provide a description of the FastSpell algorithm along with an explanation on how to use and configure it. To that end, we motivate the need of such a tool and present a benchmark including some popular language identifiers evaluated during the development of FastSpell. We show how FastSpell is useful not only to improve identification of similar languages, but also to identify new ones ignored by other tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08345v1,2024-04
Toward a Theory of Tokenization in LLMs,"Nived Rajaraman, Jiantao Jiao, Kannan Ramchandran","While there has been a large body of research attempting to circumvent tokenization for language modeling (Clark et al., 2022; Xue et al., 2022), the current consensus is that it is a necessary initial step for designing state-of-the-art performant language models. In this paper, we investigate tokenization from a theoretical point of view by studying the behavior of transformers on simple data generating processes. When trained on data drawn from certain simple $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov processes for $k > 1$, transformers exhibit a surprising phenomenon - in the absence of tokenization, they empirically fail to learn the right distribution and predict characters according to a unigram model (Makkuva et al., 2024). With the addition of tokenization, however, we empirically observe that transformers break through this barrier and are able to model the probabilities of sequences drawn from the source near-optimally, achieving small cross-entropy loss. With this observation as starting point, we study the end-to-end cross-entropy loss achieved by transformers with and without tokenization. With the appropriate tokenization, we show that even the simplest unigram models (over tokens) learnt by transformers are able to model the probability of sequences drawn from $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov sources near optimally. Our analysis provides a justification for the use of tokenization in practice through studying the behavior of transformers on Markovian data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08335v1,2024-04
The Integration of Semantic and Structural Knowledge in Knowledge Graph Entity Typing,"Muzhi Li, Minda Hu, Irwin King, Ho-fung Leung","The Knowledge Graph Entity Typing (KGET) task aims to predict missing type annotations for entities in knowledge graphs. Recent works only utilize the \textit{\textbf{structural knowledge}} in the local neighborhood of entities, disregarding \textit{\textbf{semantic knowledge}} in the textual representations of entities, relations, and types that are also crucial for type inference. Additionally, we observe that the interaction between semantic and structural knowledge can be utilized to address the false-negative problem. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{\underline{S}}emantic and \textbf{\underline{S}}tructure-aware KG \textbf{\underline{E}}ntity \textbf{\underline{T}}yping~{(SSET)} framework, which is composed of three modules. First, the \textit{Semantic Knowledge Encoding} module encodes factual knowledge in the KG with a Masked Entity Typing task. Then, the \textit{Structural Knowledge Aggregation} module aggregates knowledge from the multi-hop neighborhood of entities to infer missing types. Finally, the \textit{Unsupervised Type Re-ranking} module utilizes the inference results from the two models above to generate type predictions that are robust to false-negative samples. Extensive experiments show that SSET significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08313v1,2024-04
Subtoxic Questions: Dive Into Attitude Change of LLM's Response in Jailbreak Attempts,"Tianyu Zhang, Zixuan Zhao, Jiaqi Huang, Jingyu Hua, Sheng Zhong","As Large Language Models (LLMs) of Prompt Jailbreaking are getting more and more attention, it is of great significance to raise a generalized research paradigm to evaluate attack strengths and a basic model to conduct subtler experiments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by focusing on a set of target questions that are inherently more sensitive to jailbreak prompts, aiming to circumvent the limitations posed by enhanced LLM security. Through designing and analyzing these sensitive questions, this paper reveals a more effective method of identifying vulnerabilities in LLMs, thereby contributing to the advancement of LLM security. This research not only challenges existing jailbreaking methodologies but also fortifies LLMs against potential exploits.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08309v1,2024-04
Relational Prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection,"Pu Li, Xiaoyan Yu, Hao Peng, Yantuan Xian, Linqin Wang, Li Sun, Jingyun Zhang, Philip S. Yu","Social Event Detection (SED) aims to identify significant events from social streams, and has a wide application ranging from public opinion analysis to risk management. In recent years, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based solutions have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, GNN-based methods often struggle with missing and noisy edges between messages, affecting the quality of learned message embedding. Moreover, these methods statically initialize node embedding before training, which, in turn, limits the ability to learn from message texts and relations simultaneously. In this paper, we approach social event detection from a new perspective based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), and present RPLM_SED (Relational prompt-based Pre-trained Language Models for Social Event Detection). We first propose a new pairwise message modeling strategy to construct social messages into message pairs with multi-relational sequences. Secondly, a new multi-relational prompt-based pairwise message learning mechanism is proposed to learn more comprehensive message representation from message pairs with multi-relational prompts using PLMs. Thirdly, we design a new clustering constraint to optimize the encoding process by enhancing intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster dispersion, making the message representation more distinguishable. We evaluate the RPLM_SED on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that the RPLM_SED model achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline, online, low-resource, and long-tail distribution scenarios for social event detection tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08263v2,2024-04
Pretraining and Updates of Domain-Specific LLM: A Case Study in the Japanese Business Domain,"Kosuke Takahashi, Takahiro Omi, Kosuke Arima, Tatsuya Ishigaki","The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various languages has been advancing, but the combination of non-English languages with domain-specific contexts remains underexplored. This paper presents our findings from training and evaluating a Japanese business domain-specific LLM designed to better understand business-related documents, such as the news on current affairs, technical reports, and patents. Additionally, LLMs in this domain require regular updates to incorporate the most recent knowledge. Therefore, we also report our findings from the first experiments and evaluations involving updates to this LLM using the latest article data, which is an important problem setting that has not been addressed in previous research. From our experiments on a newly created benchmark dataset for question answering in the target domain, we found that (1) our pretrained model improves QA accuracy without losing general knowledge, and (2) a proper mixture of the latest and older texts in the training data for the update is necessary. Our pretrained model and business domain benchmark are publicly available to support further studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08262v3,2024-04
Investigating Neural Machine Translation for Low-Resource Languages: Using Bavarian as a Case Study,"Wan-Hua Her, Udo Kruschwitz","Machine Translation has made impressive progress in recent years offering close to human-level performance on many languages, but studies have primarily focused on high-resource languages with broad online presence and resources. With the help of growing Large Language Models, more and more low-resource languages achieve better results through the presence of other languages. However, studies have shown that not all low-resource languages can benefit from multilingual systems, especially those with insufficient training and evaluation data. In this paper, we revisit state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation techniques to develop automatic translation systems between German and Bavarian. We investigate conditions of low-resource languages such as data scarcity and parameter sensitivity and focus on refined solutions that combat low-resource difficulties and creative solutions such as harnessing language similarity. Our experiment entails applying Back-translation and Transfer Learning to automatically generate more training data and achieve higher translation performance. We demonstrate noisiness in the data and present our approach to carry out text preprocessing extensively. Evaluation was conducted using combined metrics: BLEU, chrF and TER. Statistical significance results with Bonferroni correction show surprisingly high baseline systems, and that Back-translation leads to significant improvement. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis of translation errors and system limitations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08259v1,2024-04
Measuring Cross-lingual Transfer in Bytes,"Leandro Rodrigues de Souza, Thales Sales Almeida, Roberto Lotufo, Rodrigo Nogueira","Multilingual pretraining has been a successful solution to the challenges posed by the lack of resources for languages. These models can transfer knowledge to target languages with minimal or no examples. Recent research suggests that monolingual models also have a similar capability, but the mechanisms behind this transfer remain unclear. Some studies have explored factors like language contamination and syntactic similarity. An emerging line of research suggests that the representations learned by language models contain two components: a language-specific and a language-agnostic component. The latter is responsible for transferring a more universal knowledge. However, there is a lack of comprehensive exploration of these properties across diverse target languages. To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment inspired by the work on the Scaling Laws for Transfer. We measured the amount of data transferred from a source language to a target language and found that models initialized from diverse languages perform similarly to a target language in a cross-lingual setting. This was surprising because the amount of data transferred to 10 diverse target languages, such as Spanish, Korean, and Finnish, was quite similar. We also found evidence that this transfer is not related to language contamination or language proximity, which strengthens the hypothesis that the model also relies on language-agnostic knowledge. Our experiments have opened up new possibilities for measuring how much data represents the language-agnostic representations learned during pretraining.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08191v1,2024-04
Reducing hallucination in structured outputs via Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Patrice Béchard, Orlando Marquez Ayala","A common and fundamental limitation of Generative AI (GenAI) is its propensity to hallucinate. While large language models (LLM) have taken the world by storm, without eliminating or at least reducing hallucinations, real-world GenAI systems may face challenges in user adoption. In the process of deploying an enterprise application that produces workflows based on natural language requirements, we devised a system leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to greatly improve the quality of the structured output that represents such workflows. Thanks to our implementation of RAG, our proposed system significantly reduces hallucinations in the output and improves the generalization of our LLM in out-of-domain settings. In addition, we show that using a small, well-trained retriever encoder can reduce the size of the accompanying LLM, thereby making deployments of LLM-based systems less resource-intensive.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08189v1,2024-04
Language Model Prompt Selection via Simulation Optimization,"Haoting Zhang, Jinghai He, Rhonda Righter, Zeyu Zheng","With the advancement in generative language models, the selection of prompts has gained significant attention in recent years. A prompt is an instruction or description provided by the user, serving as a guide for the generative language model in content generation. Despite existing methods for prompt selection that are based on human labor, we consider facilitating this selection through simulation optimization, aiming to maximize a pre-defined score for the selected prompt. Specifically, we propose a two-stage framework. In the first stage, we determine a feasible set of prompts in sufficient numbers, where each prompt is represented by a moderate-dimensional vector. In the subsequent stage for evaluation and selection, we construct a surrogate model of the score regarding the moderate-dimensional vectors that represent the prompts. We propose sequentially selecting the prompt for evaluation based on this constructed surrogate model. We prove the consistency of the sequential evaluation procedure in our framework. We also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, providing practical instructions for implementation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08164v2,2024-04
Multimodal Contextual Dialogue Breakdown Detection for Conversational AI Models,"Md Messal Monem Miah, Ulie Schnaithmann, Arushi Raghuvanshi, Youngseo Son","Detecting dialogue breakdown in real time is critical for conversational AI systems, because it enables taking corrective action to successfully complete a task. In spoken dialog systems, this breakdown can be caused by a variety of unexpected situations including high levels of background noise, causing STT mistranscriptions, or unexpected user flows. In particular, industry settings like healthcare, require high precision and high flexibility to navigate differently based on the conversation history and dialogue states. This makes it both more challenging and more critical to accurately detect dialog breakdown. To accurately detect breakdown, we found it requires processing audio inputs along with downstream NLP model inferences on transcribed text in real time. In this paper, we introduce a Multimodal Contextual Dialogue Breakdown (MultConDB) model. This model significantly outperforms other known best models by achieving an F1 of 69.27.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08156v1,2024-04
Graph Integrated Language Transformers for Next Action Prediction in Complex Phone Calls,"Amin Hosseiny Marani, Ulie Schnaithmann, Youngseo Son, Akil Iyer, Manas Paldhe, Arushi Raghuvanshi","Current Conversational AI systems employ different machine learning pipelines, as well as external knowledge sources and business logic to predict the next action. Maintaining various components in dialogue managers' pipeline adds complexity in expansion and updates, increases processing time, and causes additive noise through the pipeline that can lead to incorrect next action prediction. This paper investigates graph integration into language transformers to improve understanding the relationships between humans' utterances, previous, and next actions without the dependency on external sources or components. Experimental analyses on real calls indicate that the proposed Graph Integrated Language Transformer models can achieve higher performance compared to other production level conversational AI systems in driving interactive calls with human users in real-world settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08155v1,2024-04
Distilling Algorithmic Reasoning from LLMs via Explaining Solution Programs,"Jierui Li, Raymond Mooney","Distilling explicit chain-of-thought reasoning paths has emerged as an effective method for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, when tackling complex tasks that pose significant challenges for state-of-the-art models, this technique often struggles to produce effective chains of thought that lead to correct answers. In this work, we propose a novel approach to distill reasoning abilities from LLMs by leveraging their capacity to explain solutions. We apply our method to solving competitive-level programming challenges. More specifically, we employ an LLM to generate explanations for a set of <problem, solution-program> pairs, then use <problem, explanation> pairs to fine-tune a smaller language model, which we refer to as the Reasoner, to learn algorithmic reasoning that can generate ""how-to-solve"" hints for unseen problems. Our experiments demonstrate that learning from explanations enables the Reasoner to more effectively guide program implementation by a Coder, resulting in higher solve rates than strong chain-of-thought baselines on competitive-level programming problems. It also outperforms models that learn directly from <problem, solution-program> pairs. We curated an additional test set in the CodeContests format, which includes 246 more recent problems posted after the models' knowledge cutoff.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08148v1,2024-04

HLTCOE at TREC 2023 NeuCLIR Track,"Eugene Yang, Dawn Lawrie, James Mayfield","The HLTCOE team applied PLAID, an mT5 reranker, and document translation to the TREC 2023 NeuCLIR track. For PLAID we included a variety of models and training techniques -- the English model released with ColBERT v2, translate-train~(TT), Translate Distill~(TD) and multilingual translate-train~(MTT). TT trains a ColBERT model with English queries and passages automatically translated into the document language from the MS-MARCO v1 collection. This results in three cross-language models for the track, one per language. MTT creates a single model for all three document languages by combining the translations of MS-MARCO passages in all three languages into mixed-language batches. Thus the model learns about matching queries to passages simultaneously in all languages. Distillation uses scores from the mT5 model over non-English translated document pairs to learn how to score query-document pairs.

S3Editor: A Sparse Semantic-Disentangled Self-Training Framework for Face Video Editing,"Guangzhi Wang, Tianyi Chen, Kamran Ghasedi, HsiangTao Wu, Tianyu Ding, Chris Nuesmeyer, Ilya Zharkov, Mohan Kankanhalli, Luming Liang","Face attribute editing plays a pivotal role in various applications. However, existing methods encounter challenges in achieving high-quality results while preserving identity, editing faithfulness, and temporal consistency. These challenges are rooted in issues related to the training pipeline, including limited supervision, architecture design, and optimization strategy. In this work, we introduce S3Editor, a Sparse Semantic-disentangled Self-training framework for face video editing. S3Editor is a generic solution that comprehensively addresses these challenges with three key contributions. Firstly, S3Editor adopts a self-training paradigm to enhance the training process through semi-supervision. Secondly, we propose a semantic disentangled architecture with a dynamic routing mechanism that accommodates diverse editing requirements. Thirdly, we present a structured sparse optimization schema that identifies and deactivates malicious neurons to further disentangle impacts from untarget attributes. S3Editor is model-agnostic and compatible with various editing approaches. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative results affirm that our approach significantly enhances identity preservation, editing fidelity, as well as temporal consistency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08111v1,2024-04
Human Latency Conversational Turns for Spoken Avatar Systems,"Derek Jacoby, Tianyi Zhang, Aanchan Mohan, Yvonne Coady","A problem with many current Large Language Model (LLM) driven spoken dialogues is the response time. Some efforts such as Groq address this issue by lightning fast processing of the LLM, but we know from the cognitive psychology literature that in human-to-human dialogue often responses occur prior to the speaker completing their utterance. No amount of delay for LLM processing is acceptable if we wish to maintain human dialogue latencies. In this paper, we discuss methods for understanding an utterance in close to real time and generating a response so that the system can comply with human-level conversational turn delays. This means that the information content of the final part of the speaker's utterance is lost to the LLM. Using the Google NaturalQuestions (NQ) database, our results show GPT-4 can effectively fill in missing context from a dropped word at the end of a question over 60% of the time. We also provide some examples of utterances and the impacts of this information loss on the quality of LLM response in the context of an avatar that is currently under development. These results indicate that a simple classifier could be used to determine whether a question is semantically complete, or requires a filler phrase to allow a response to be generated within human dialogue time constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16053v1,2024-04
Rumour Evaluation with Very Large Language Models,"Dahlia Shehata, Robin Cohen, Charles Clarke","Conversational prompt-engineering-based large language models (LLMs) have enabled targeted control over the output creation, enhancing versatility, adaptability and adhoc retrieval. From another perspective, digital misinformation has reached alarming levels. The anonymity, availability and reach of social media offer fertile ground for rumours to propagate. This work proposes to leverage the advancement of prompting-dependent LLMs to combat misinformation by extending the research efforts of the RumourEval task on its Twitter dataset. To the end, we employ two prompting-based LLM variants (GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4) to extend the two RumourEval subtasks: (1) veracity prediction, and (2) stance classification. For veracity prediction, three classifications schemes are experimented per GPT variant. Each scheme is tested in zero-, one- and few-shot settings. Our best results outperform the precedent ones by a substantial margin. For stance classification, prompting-based-approaches show comparable performance to prior results, with no improvement over finetuning methods. Rumour stance subtask is also extended beyond the original setting to allow multiclass classification. All of the generated predictions for both subtasks are equipped with confidence scores determining their trustworthiness degree according to the LLM, and post-hoc justifications for explainability and interpretability purposes. Our primary aim is AI for social good.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16859v1,2024-04
Data-Augmentation-Based Dialectal Adaptation for LLMs,"Fahim Faisal, Antonios Anastasopoulos","This report presents GMUNLP's participation to the Dialect-Copa shared task at VarDial 2024, which focuses on evaluating the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on South Slavic micro-dialects. The task aims to assess how well LLMs can handle non-standard dialectal varieties, as their performance on standard languages is already well-established. We propose an approach that combines the strengths of different types of language models and leverages data augmentation techniques to improve task performance on three South Slavic dialects: Chakavian, Cherkano, and Torlak. We conduct experiments using a language-family-focused encoder-based model (BERTi\'c) and a domain-agnostic multilingual model (AYA-101). Our results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation techniques lead to substantial performance gains across all three test datasets in the open-source model category. This work highlights the practical utility of data augmentation and the potential of LLMs in handling non-standard dialectal varieties, contributing to the broader goal of advancing natural language understanding in low-resource and dialectal settings.

Variance-reduced Zeroth-Order Methods for Fine-Tuning Language Models,"Tanmay Gautam, Youngsuk Park, Hao Zhou, Parameswaran Raman, Wooseok Ha","Fine-tuning language models (LMs) has demonstrated success in a wide array of downstream tasks. However, as LMs are scaled up, the memory requirements for backpropagation become prohibitively high. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods can leverage memory-efficient forward passes to estimate gradients. More recently, MeZO, an adaptation of ZO-SGD, has been shown to consistently outperform zero-shot and in-context learning when combined with suitable task prompts. In this work, we couple ZO methods with variance reduction techniques to enhance stability and convergence for inference-based LM fine-tuning. We introduce Memory-Efficient Zeroth-Order Stochastic Variance-Reduced Gradient (MeZO-SVRG) and demonstrate its efficacy across multiple LM fine-tuning tasks, eliminating the reliance on task-specific prompts. Evaluated across a range of both masked and autoregressive LMs on benchmark GLUE tasks, MeZO-SVRG outperforms MeZO with up to 20% increase in test accuracies in both full- and partial-parameter fine-tuning settings. MeZO-SVRG benefits from reduced computation time as it often surpasses MeZO's peak test accuracy with a $2\times$ reduction in GPU-hours. MeZO-SVRG significantly reduces the required memory footprint compared to first-order SGD, i.e. by $2\times$ for autoregressive models. Our experiments highlight that MeZO-SVRG's memory savings progressively improve compared to SGD with larger batch sizes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08080v1,2024-04
SQBC: Active Learning using LLM-Generated Synthetic Data for Stance Detection in Online Political Discussions,"Stefan Sylvius Wagner, Maike Behrendt, Marc Ziegele, Stefan Harmeling","Stance detection is an important task for many applications that analyse or support online political discussions. Common approaches include fine-tuning transformer based models. However, these models require a large amount of labelled data, which might not be available. In this work, we present two different ways to leverage LLM-generated synthetic data to train and improve stance detection agents for online political discussions: first, we show that augmenting a small fine-tuning dataset with synthetic data can improve the performance of the stance detection model. Second, we propose a new active learning method called SQBC based on the ""Query-by-Comittee"" approach. The key idea is to use LLM-generated synthetic data as an oracle to identify the most informative unlabelled samples, that are selected for manual labelling. Comprehensive experiments show that both ideas can improve the stance detection performance. Curiously, we observed that fine-tuning on actively selected samples can exceed the performance of using the full dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08078v1,2024-04
MSciNLI: A Diverse Benchmark for Scientific Natural Language Inference,"Mobashir Sadat, Cornelia Caragea","The task of scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) involves predicting the semantic relation between two sentences extracted from research articles. This task was recently proposed along with a new dataset called SciNLI derived from papers published in the computational linguistics domain. In this paper, we aim to introduce diversity in the scientific NLI task and present MSciNLI, a dataset containing 132,320 sentence pairs extracted from five new scientific domains. The availability of multiple domains makes it possible to study domain shift for scientific NLI. We establish strong baselines on MSciNLI by fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and prompting Large Language Models (LLMs). The highest Macro F1 scores of PLM and LLM baselines are 77.21% and 51.77%, respectively, illustrating that MSciNLI is challenging for both types of models. Furthermore, we show that domain shift degrades the performance of scientific NLI models which demonstrates the diverse characteristics of different domains in our dataset. Finally, we use both scientific NLI datasets in an intermediate task transfer learning setting and show that they can improve the performance of downstream tasks in the scientific domain.

Any2Point: Empowering Any-modality Large Models for Efficient 3D Understanding,"Yiwen Tang, Ray Zhang, Jiaming Liu, Zoey Guo, Dong Wang, Zhigang Wang, Bin Zhao, Shanghang Zhang, Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li, Xuelong Li","Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus of interest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios. Due to the scarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained transformers from vision to 3D domains. However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are still limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high computation cost. More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D models, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm. In this paper, we introduce Any2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models (vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer from any source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection strategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions within the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token with a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D geometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the transformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within each transformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatial knowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D tokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers. We conduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

The Role of Language Imbalance in Cross-lingual Generalisation: Insights from Cloned Language Experiments,"Anton Schäfer, Shauli Ravfogel, Thomas Hofmann, Tiago Pimentel, Imanol Schlag","Multilinguality is crucial for extending recent advancements in language modelling to diverse linguistic communities. To maintain high performance while representing multiple languages, multilingual models ideally align representations, allowing what is learned in one language to generalise to others. Prior research has emphasised the importance of parallel data and shared vocabulary elements as key factors for such alignment. In this study, we investigate an unintuitive novel driver of cross-lingual generalisation: language imbalance. In controlled experiments on perfectly equivalent cloned languages, we observe that the existence of a predominant language during training boosts the performance of less frequent languages and leads to stronger alignment of model representations across languages. Furthermore, we find that this trend is amplified with scale: with large enough models or long enough training, we observe that bilingual training data with a 90/10 language split yields better performance on both languages than a balanced 50/50 split. Building on these insights, we design training schemes that can improve performance in all cloned languages, even without altering the training data. As we extend our analysis to real languages, we find that infrequent languages still benefit from frequent ones, yet whether language imbalance causes cross-lingual generalisation there is not conclusive.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07982v4,2024-04
Manipulating Large Language Models to Increase Product Visibility,"Aounon Kumar, Himabindu Lakkaraju","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into search engines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries. Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models for quick and easy purchase decisions. In this work, we investigate whether recommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility. We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefully crafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increase its likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation. To understand the impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyze its effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM's recommendations and another that usually ranks second. We observe that the strategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both products by increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation. This ability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a considerable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market competition. Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how webpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing LLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-driven search services.

LLoCO: Learning Long Contexts Offline,"Sijun Tan, Xiuyu Li, Shishir Patil, Ziyang Wu, Tianjun Zhang, Kurt Keutzer, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Raluca Ada Popa","Processing long contexts remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the quadratic computational and memory overhead of the self-attention mechanism and the substantial KV cache sizes during generation. We propose LLoCO, a novel approach to address this problem by learning contexts offline through context compression and in-domain parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA. Our method enables an LLM to create a concise representation of the original context and efficiently retrieve relevant information to answer questions accurately. Our approach extends the effective context window of a 4k token LLaMA2-7B model to handle up to 128k tokens. We evaluate our approach on several long-context question-answering datasets, demonstrating that LLoCO significantly outperforms in-context learning while using $30\times$ fewer tokens during inference. LLoCO achieves up to $7.62\times$ speed-up during inference and $11.52\times$ higher throughput during finetuning, substantially reduces the cost of long document question answering. This makes it a promising solution for efficient long context processing. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/jeffreysijuntan/lloco.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07979v2,2024-04

However, existing benchmarks either lack an interactive environment or are limited to environments specific to certain applications or domains, failing to reflect the diverse and complex nature of real-world computer use, thereby limiting the scope of tasks and agent scalability. To address this issue, we introduce OSWorld, the first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environment for multimodal agents, supporting task setup, execution-based evaluation, and interactive learning across various operating systems such as Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. OSWorld can serve as a unified, integrated computer environment for assessing open-ended computer tasks that involve arbitrary applications. Building upon OSWorld, we create a benchmark of 369 computer tasks involving real web and desktop apps in open domains, OS file I/O, and workflows spanning multiple applications. Each task example is derived from real-world computer use cases and includes a detailed initial state setup configuration and a custom execution-based evaluation script for reliable, reproducible evaluation. Extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents on OSWorld reveals significant deficiencies in their ability to serve as computer assistants. While humans can accomplish over 72.36% of the tasks, the best model achieves only 12.24% success, primarily struggling with GUI grounding and operational knowledge.

Rho-1: Not All Tokens Are What You Need,"Zhenghao Lin, Zhibin Gou, Yeyun Gong, Xiao Liu, Yelong Shen, Ruochen Xu, Chen Lin, Yujiu Yang, Jian Jiao, Nan Duan, Weizhu Chen","Previous language model pre-training methods have uniformly applied a next-token prediction loss to all training tokens. Challenging this norm, we posit that ""9l training"". Our initial analysis examines token-level training dynamics of language model, revealing distinct loss patterns for different tokens. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a new language model called Rho-1. Unlike traditional LMs that learn to predict every next token in a corpus, Rho-1 employs Selective Language Modeling (SLM), which selectively trains on useful tokens that aligned with the desired distribution. This approach involves scoring pretraining tokens using a reference model, and then training the language model with a focused loss on tokens with higher scores. When continual pretraining on 15B OpenWebMath corpus, Rho-1 yields an absolute improvement in few-shot accuracy of up to 30% in 9 math tasks. After fine-tuning, Rho-1-1B and 7B achieved state-of-the-art results of 40.6% and 51.8% on MATH dataset, respectively - matching DeepSeekMath with only 3% of the pretraining tokens. Furthermore, when continual pretraining on 80B general tokens, Rho-1 achieves 6.8% average enhancement across 15 diverse tasks, increasing both efficiency and performance of the language model pre-training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07965v4,2024-04
CEM: A Data-Efficient Method for Large Language Models to Continue Evolving From Mistakes,"Haokun Zhao, Haixia Han, Jie Shi, Chengyu Du, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao","As world knowledge advances and new task schemas emerge, Continual Learning (CL) becomes essential for keeping Large Language Models (LLMs) current and addressing their shortcomings. This process typically involves continual instruction tuning (CIT) and continual pre-training (CPT) to enable these models to adapt to novel tasks and acquire critical knowledge. However, collecting sufficient CPT data and efficiently bridging knowledge gaps remain significant challenges. Inspired by the 'summarizing mistakes' strategy, we propose the Continue Evolving from Mistakes (CEM) method, a data-efficient approach aiming to collect CPT data and continually improve LLMs' performance through iterative evaluation and supplementation with mistake-relevant knowledge. To further optimize data usage and mitigate forgetting, we introduce a novel training paradigm that combines CIT and CPT. Experiments show that CEM substantially enhances multiple models' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA tasks, achieving gains of up to 29.63%.

AmpleGCG: Learning a Universal and Transferable Generative Model of Adversarial Suffixes for Jailbreaking Both Open and Closed LLMs,"Zeyi Liao, Huan Sun","As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent and integrated into autonomous systems, ensuring their safety is imperative. Despite significant strides toward safety alignment, recent work GCG~\citep{zou2023universal} proposes a discrete token optimization algorithm and selects the single suffix with the lowest loss to successfully jailbreak aligned LLMs. In this work, we first discuss the drawbacks of solely picking the suffix with the lowest loss during GCG optimization for jailbreaking and uncover the missed successful suffixes during the intermediate steps. Moreover, we utilize those successful suffixes as training data to learn a generative model, named AmpleGCG, which captures the distribution of adversarial suffixes given a harmful query and enables the rapid generation of hundreds of suffixes for any harmful queries in seconds. AmpleGCG achieves near 100\% attack success rate (ASR) on two aligned LLMs (Llama-2-7B-chat and Vicuna-7B), surpassing two strongest attack baselines. More interestingly, AmpleGCG also transfers seamlessly to attack different models, including closed-source LLMs, achieving a 99\% ASR on the latest GPT-3.5. To summarize, our work amplifies the impact of GCG by training a generative model of adversarial suffixes that is universal to any harmful queries and transferable from attacking open-source LLMs to closed-source LLMs. In addition, it can generate 200 adversarial suffixes for one harmful query in only 4 seconds, rendering it more challenging to defend.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07921v3,2024-04
DesignQA: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models' Understanding of Engineering Documentation,"Anna C. Doris, Daniele Grandi, Ryan Tomich, Md Ferdous Alam, Mohammadmehdi Ataei, Hyunmin Cheong, Faez Ahmed","This research introduces DesignQA, a novel benchmark aimed at evaluating the proficiency of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in comprehending and applying engineering requirements in technical documentation. Developed with a focus on real-world engineering challenges, DesignQA uniquely combines multimodal data-including textual design requirements, CAD images, and engineering drawings-derived from the Formula SAE student competition. Different from many existing MLLM benchmarks, DesignQA contains document-grounded visual questions where the input image and input document come from different sources. The benchmark features automatic evaluation metrics and is divided into segments-Rule Comprehension, Rule Compliance, and Rule Extraction-based on tasks that engineers perform when designing according to requirements. We evaluate state-of-the-art models (at the time of writing) like GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude-Opus, Gemini-1.0, and LLaVA-1.5 against the benchmark, and our study uncovers the existing gaps in MLLMs' abilities to interpret complex engineering documentation. The MLLMs tested, while promising, struggle to reliably retrieve relevant rules from the Formula SAE documentation, face challenges in recognizing technical components in CAD images, and encounter difficulty in analyzing engineering drawings. These findings underscore the need for multimodal models that can better handle the multifaceted questions characteristic of design according to technical documentation. This benchmark sets a foundation for future advancements in AI-supported engineering design processes.

HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion,"Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Yiran Zhong","Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN, \citealt{HGRN}) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07904v2,2024-04
High-Dimension Human Value Representation in Large Language Models,"Samuel Cahyawijaya, Delong Chen, Yejin Bang, Leila Khalatbari, Bryan Wilie, Ziwei Ji, Etsuko Ishii, Pascale Fung","The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks and fields has necessitated the alignment of these models with human values and preferences. Given various approaches of human value alignment, ranging from Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), to constitutional learning, etc. there is an urgent need to understand the scope and nature of human values injected into these models before their release. There is also a need for model alignment without a costly large scale human annotation effort. We propose UniVaR, a high-dimensional representation of human value distributions in LLMs, orthogonal to model architecture and training data. Trained from the value-relevant output of eight multilingual LLMs and tested on the output from four multilingual LLMs, namely LlaMA2, ChatGPT, JAIS and Yi, we show that UniVaR is a powerful tool to compare the distribution of human values embedded in different LLMs with different langauge sources. Through UniVaR, we explore how different LLMs prioritize various values in different languages and cultures, shedding light on the complex interplay between human values and language modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07900v3,2024-04
Analyzing Toxicity in Deep Conversations: A Reddit Case Study,"Vigneshwaran Shankaran, Rajesh Sharma","Online social media has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ease of access and ability to connect with others. One of social media's main draws is its anonymity, allowing users to share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or retribution. This anonymity has also made social media prone to harmful content, which requires moderation to ensure responsible and productive use. Several methods using artificial intelligence have been employed to detect harmful content. However, conversation and contextual analysis of hate speech are still understudied. Most promising works only analyze a single text at a time rather than the conversation supporting it. In this work, we employ a tree-based approach to understand how users behave concerning toxicity in public conversation settings. To this end, we collect both the posts and the comment sections of the top 100 posts from 8 Reddit communities that allow profanity, totaling over 1 million responses. We find that toxic comments increase the likelihood of subsequent toxic comments being produced in online conversations. Our analysis also shows that immediate context plays a vital role in shaping a response rather than the original post. We also study the effect of consensual profanity and observe overlapping similarities with non-consensual profanity in terms of user behavior and patterns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07879v1,2024-04
Guiding Large Language Models to Post-Edit Machine Translation with Error Annotations,"Dayeon Ki, Marine Carpuat","Machine Translation (MT) remains one of the last NLP tasks where large language models (LLMs) have not yet replaced dedicated supervised systems. This work exploits the complementary strengths of LLMs and supervised MT by guiding LLMs to automatically post-edit MT with external feedback on its quality, derived from Multidimensional Quality Metric (MQM) annotations. Working with LLaMA-2 models, we consider prompting strategies varying the nature of feedback provided and then fine-tune the LLM to improve its ability to exploit the provided guidance. Through experiments on Chinese-English, English-German, and English-Russian MQM data, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to post-edit MT improves TER, BLEU and COMET scores, although the benefits of fine-grained feedback are not clear. Fine-tuning helps integrate fine-grained feedback more effectively and further improves translation quality based on both automatic and human evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07851v1,2024-04
On Training Data Influence of GPT Models,"Yekun Chai, Qingyi Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Qiwei Peng, Hua Wu","Amidst the rapid advancements in generative language models, the investigation of how training data shapes the performance of GPT models is still emerging. This paper presents GPTfluence, a novel approach that leverages a featurized simulation to assess the impact of training examples on the training dynamics of GPT models.

Contrary to earlier methods that struggle with generalization to new data, GPTfluence introduces a parameterized simulation of training dynamics, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities to unseen training data. This adaptability is evident across both fine-tuning and instruction-tuning scenarios, spanning tasks in natural language understanding and generation.

Heron-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Vision Language Models in Japanese,"Yuichi Inoue, Kento Sasaki, Yuma Ochi, Kazuki Fujii, Kotaro Tanahashi, Yu Yamaguchi","Vision Language Models (VLMs) have undergone a rapid evolution, giving rise to significant advancements in the realm of multimodal understanding tasks. However, the majority of these models are trained and evaluated on English-centric datasets, leaving a gap in the development and evaluation of VLMs for other languages, such as Japanese. This gap can be attributed to the lack of methodologies for constructing VLMs and the absence of benchmarks to accurately measure their performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel benchmark, Japanese Heron-Bench, for evaluating Japanese capabilities of VLMs. The Japanese Heron-Bench consists of a variety of imagequestion answer pairs tailored to the Japanese context. Additionally, we present a baseline Japanese VLM that has been trained with Japanese visual instruction tuning datasets. Our Heron-Bench reveals the strengths and limitations of the proposed VLM across various ability dimensions.

However, the predominately used rule-based systems are highly restricted to specific settings, and upcoming machine learning approaches suffer from a lack of labeled data. In this work, we explore the feasibility of proprietary and open-source large language models (LLMs) for TE normalization using in-context learning to inject task, document, and example information into the model. We explore various sample selection strategies to retrieve the most relevant set of examples. By using a window-based prompt design approach, we can perform TE normalization across sentences, while leveraging the LLM knowledge without training the model.

Using Letter Positional Probabilities to Assess Word Complexity,Michael Dalvean,"Word complexity is defined in a number of different ways. Psycholinguistic, morphological and lexical proxies are often used. Human ratings are also used. The problem here is that these proxies do not measure complexity directly, and human ratings are susceptible to subjective bias. In this study we contend that some form of 'latent complexity' can be approximated by using samples of simple and complex words. We use a sample of 'simple' words from primary school picture books and a sample of 'complex' words from high school and academic settings. In order to analyse the differences between these classes, we look at the letter positional probabilities (LPPs). We find strong statistical associations between several LPPs and complexity. For example, simple words are significantly (p<.001) more likely to start with w, b, s, h, g, k, j, t, y or f, while complex words are significantly (p<.001) more likely to start with i, a, e, r, v, u or d. We find similar strong associations for subsequent letter positions, with 84 letter-position variables in the first 6 positions being significant at the p<.001 level. We then use LPPs as variables in creating a classifier which can classify the two classes with an 83% accuracy. We test these findings using a second data set, with 66 LPPs significant (p<.001) in the first 6 positions common to both datasets. We use these 66 variables to create a classifier that is able to classify a third dataset with an accuracy of 70%. Finally, we create a fourth sample by combining the extreme high and low scoring words generated by three classifiers built on the first three separate datasets and use this sample to build a classifier which has an accuracy of 97%. We use this to score the four levels of English word groups from an ESL program.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07768v4,2024-04
"AnnoCTR: A Dataset for Detecting and Linking Entities, Tactics, and Techniques in Cyber Threat Reports","Lukas Lange, Marc Müller, Ghazaleh Haratinezhad Torbati, Dragan Milchevski, Patrick Grau, Subhash Pujari, Annemarie Friedrich","Monitoring the threat landscape to be aware of actual or potential attacks is of utmost importance to cybersecurity professionals. Information about cyber threats is typically distributed using natural language reports. Natural language processing can help with managing this large amount of unstructured information, yet to date, the topic has received little attention. With this paper, we present AnnoCTR, a new CC-BY-SA-licensed dataset of cyber threat reports. The reports have been annotated by a domain expert with named entities, temporal expressions, and cybersecurity-specific concepts including implicitly mentioned techniques and tactics. Entities and concepts are linked to Wikipedia and the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base, the most widely-used taxonomy for classifying types of attacks. Prior datasets linking to MITRE ATT&CK either provide a single label per document or annotate sentences out-of-context; our dataset annotates entire documents in a much finer-grained way. In an experimental study, we model the annotations of our dataset using state-of-the-art neural models.

To enhance its productivity, we propose a ResearchAgent, a large language model-powered research idea writing agent, which automatically generates problems, methods, and experiment designs while iteratively refining them based on scientific literature. Specifically, starting with a core paper as the primary focus to generate ideas, our ResearchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications through connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from an entity-centric knowledge store based on their underlying concepts, mined and shared across numerous papers. In addition, mirroring the human approach to iteratively improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback iteratively. Further, they are instantiated with human preference-aligned large language models whose criteria for evaluation are derived from actual human judgments.

Automatic Generation and Evaluation of Reading Comprehension Test Items with Large Language Models,"Andreas Säuberli, Simon Clematide","Reading comprehension tests are used in a variety of applications, reaching from education to assessing the comprehensibility of simplified texts. However, creating such tests manually and ensuring their quality is difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate and evaluate multiple-choice reading comprehension items. To this end, we compiled a dataset of German reading comprehension items and developed a new protocol for human and automatic evaluation, including a metric we call text informativity, which is based on guessability and answerability. We then used this protocol and the dataset to evaluate the quality of items generated by Llama 2 and GPT-4. Our results suggest that both models are capable of generating items of acceptable quality in a zero-shot setting, but GPT-4 clearly outperforms Llama 2. We also show that LLMs can be used for automatic evaluation by eliciting item reponses from them. In this scenario, evaluation results with GPT-4 were the most similar to human annotators. Overall, zero-shot generation with LLMs is a promising approach for generating and evaluating reading comprehension test items, in particular for languages without large amounts of available data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07720v2,2024-04
ODA: Observation-Driven Agent for integrating LLMs and Knowledge Graphs,"Lei Sun, Zhengwei Tao, Youdi Li, Hiroshi Arakawa","The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) has achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks.

To address this, we introduce Observation-Driven Agent (ODA), a novel AI agent framework tailored for tasks involving KGs. ODA incorporates KG reasoning abilities via global observation, which enhances reasoning capabilities through a cyclical paradigm of observation, action, and reflection. Confronting the exponential explosion of knowledge during observation, we innovatively design a recursive observation mechanism.

The datasets are parallel with Spanish, the dominant language of the region, and are taken from official native sources focused on representing informal, day-to-day, and non-domain-specific language. As such, and according to our dialectometric analysis, they differ in register from most other available resources. Additionally, we present neural machine translation models, trained on as many resources and Mayan languages as possible, and evaluated exclusively on our datasets. We observe lexical divergences between the dialects of Spanish in our resources and the more widespread written standard of Spanish, and that resources other than the ones we present do not seem to improve translation performance, indicating that many such resources may not accurately capture common, real-life language usage.

Why do small language models underperform? Studying Language Model Saturation via the Softmax Bottleneck,"Nathan Godey, Éric de la Clergerie, Benoît Sagot","Recent advances in language modeling consist in pretraining highly parameterized neural networks on extremely large web-mined text corpora. Training and inference with such models can be costly in practice, which incentivizes the use of smaller counterparts. However, it has been observed that smaller models can suffer from saturation, characterized as a drop in performance at some advanced point in training followed by a plateau. In this paper, we find that such saturation can be explained by a mismatch between the hidden dimension of smaller models and the high rank of the target contextual probability distribution. This mismatch affects the performance of the linear prediction head used in such models through the well-known softmax bottleneck phenomenon. We measure the effect of the softmax bottleneck in various settings and find that models based on less than 1000 hidden dimensions tend to adopt degenerate latent representations in late pretraining, which leads to reduced evaluation performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07647v1,2024-04
Language Models Meet Anomaly Detection for Better Interpretability and Generalizability,"Jun Li, Su Hwan Kim, Philip Müller, Lina Felsner, Daniel Rueckert, Benedikt Wiestler, Julia A. Schnabel, Cosmin I.

To investigate these questions, we introduce a new dataset for multi-image visual question-answering on brain magnetic resonance images encompassing multiple conditions. We propose KQ-Former (Knowledge Querying Transformer), which is designed to optimally align visual and textual information in limited-sample contexts. Our model achieves a 60.81% accuracy on closed questions, covering disease classification and severity across 15 different classes. For open questions, KQ-Former demonstrates a 70% improvement over the baseline with a BLEU-4 score of 0.41, and achieves the highest entailment ratios (up to 71.9%) and lowest contradiction ratios (down to 10.0%) among various natural language inference models. Furthermore, integrating anomaly maps results in an 18% accuracy increase in detecting open-set anomalies, thereby enhancing the language model's generalizability to previously unseen medical conditions.

Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) have recently been adapted to the medical domain, so that they can be used as a tool for mediating in human-AI interaction. While these LLMs display competitive performance on automated medical texts benchmarks, they have been pre-trained and evaluated with a focus on a single language (English mostly). This is particularly true of text-to-text models, which typically require large amounts of domain-specific pre-training data, often not easily accessible for many languages. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by compiling, to the best of our knowledge, the largest multilingual corpus for the medical domain in four languages, namely English, French, Italian and Spanish. This new corpus has been used to train Medical mT5, the first open-source text-to-text multilingual model for the medical domain.

UltraEval: A Lightweight Platform for Flexible and Comprehensive Evaluation for LLMs,"Chaoqun He, Renjie Luo, Shengding Hu, Yuanqian Zhao, Jie Zhou, Hanghao Wu, Jiajie Zhang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Evaluation is pivotal for refining Large Language Models (LLMs), pinpointing their capabilities, and guiding enhancements. The rapid development of LLMs calls for a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for swift evaluation deployment. However, considering various implementation details, developing a comprehensive evaluation platform is never easy. Existing platforms are often complex and poorly modularized, hindering seamless incorporation into research workflows. This paper introduces UltraEval, a user-friendly evaluation framework characterized by its lightweight nature, comprehensiveness, modularity, and efficiency. We identify and reimplement three core components of model evaluation (models, data, and metrics). The resulting composability allows for the free combination of different models, tasks, prompts, benchmarks, and metrics within a unified evaluation workflow. Additionally, UltraEval supports diverse models owing to a unified HTTP service and provides sufficient inference acceleration.

Comments as Natural Logic Pivots: Improve Code Generation via Comment Perspective,"Yijie Chen, Yijin Liu, Fandong Meng, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu, Jie Zhou","Code generation aims to understand the problem description and generate corresponding code snippets, where existing works generally decompose such complex tasks into intermediate steps by prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought and its variants. While these studies have achieved some success, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the capabilities of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, particularly in terms of API calls, which significantly limits their practical applicability. Consequently, how to enhance the code generation capabilities of small and medium-scale code LLMs without significantly increasing training costs is an appealing challenge. In this paper, we suggest that code comments are the natural logic pivot between natural language and code language and propose using comments to boost the code generation ability of code LLMs. Concretely, we propose MANGO (comMents As Natural loGic pivOts), including a comment contrastive training strategy and a corresponding logical comment decoding strategy. Experiments are performed on HumanEval and MBPP, utilizing StarCoder and WizardCoder as backbone models, and encompassing model parameter sizes between 3B and 7B. The results indicate that MANGO significantly improves the code pass rate based on the strong baselines. Meanwhile, the robustness of the logical comment decoding strategy is notably higher than the Chain-of-thoughts prompting. The code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/pppa2019/Mango}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07549v1,2024-04
Does In-Context Learning Really Learn? Rethinking How Large Language Models Respond and Solve Tasks via In-Context Learning,"Quanyu Long, Yin Wu, Wenya Wang, Sinno Jialin Pan","In-context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability alongside the development of scaled-up large language models (LLMs). By instructing LLMs using few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide range of tasks without updating millions of parameters. However, the precise contributions of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance have not been thoroughly investigated in recent analytical studies. In this paper, we empirically decompose the overall performance of ICL into three dimensions, label space, format, and discrimination, and we evaluate four general-purpose LLMs across a diverse range of tasks. Counter-intuitively, we find that the demonstrations have a marginal impact on provoking discriminative knowledge of language models. However, ICL exhibits significant efficacy in regulating the label space and format, which helps LLMs respond to desired label words. We then demonstrate that this ability functions similar to detailed instructions for LLMs to follow. We additionally provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of retrieval helping with ICL. Our findings demonstrate that retrieving the semantically similar examples notably boosts the model's discriminative capability. However, we also observe a trade-off in selecting good in-context examples regarding label diversity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07546v2,2024-04
From Words to Numbers: Your Large Language Model Is Secretly A Capable Regressor When Given In-Context Examples,"Robert Vacareanu, Vlad-Andrei Negru, Vasile Suciu, Mihai Surdeanu","We analyze how well pre-trained large language models (e.g., Llama2, GPT-4, Claude 3, etc) can do linear and non-linear regression when given in-context examples, without any additional training or gradient updates. Our findings reveal that several large language models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3) are able to perform regression tasks with a performance rivaling (or even outperforming) that of traditional supervised methods such as Random Forest, Bagging, or Gradient Boosting. For example, on the challenging Friedman #2 regression dataset, Claude 3 outperforms many supervised methods such as AdaBoost, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, or Gradient Boosting. We then investigate how well the performance of large language models scales with the number of in-context exemplars. We borrow from the notion of regret from online learning and empirically show that LLMs are capable of obtaining a sub-linear regret.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07544v3,2024-04
"Introducing L2M3, A Multilingual Medical Large Language Model to Advance Health Equity in Low-Resource Regions",Agasthya Gangavarapu,"Addressing the imminent shortfall of 10 million health workers by 2030, predominantly in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), this paper introduces an innovative approach that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with machine translation models.

PromptSync: Bridging Domain Gaps in Vision-Language Models through Class-Aware Prototype Alignment and Discrimination,Anant Khandelwal,"The potential for zero-shot generalization in vision-language (V-L) models such as CLIP has spurred their widespread adoption in addressing numerous downstream tasks. Previous methods have employed test-time prompt tuning to adapt the model to unseen domains, but they overlooked the issue of imbalanced class distributions. In this study, we explicitly address this problem by employing class-aware prototype alignment weighted by mean class probabilities obtained for the test sample and filtered augmented views. Additionally, we ensure that the class probabilities are as accurate as possible by performing prototype discrimination using contrastive learning. The combination of alignment and discriminative loss serves as a geometric regularizer, preventing the prompt representation from collapsing onto a single class and effectively bridging the distribution gap between the source and test domains. Our method, named PromptSync, synchronizes the prompts for each test sample on both the text and vision branches of the V-L model. In empirical evaluations on the domain generalization benchmark, our method outperforms previous best methods by 2.33% in overall performance, by 1% in base-to-novel generalization, and by 2.84% in cross-dataset transfer tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07520v2,2024-04
MM-PhyQA: Multimodal Physics Question-Answering With Multi-Image CoT Prompting,"Avinash Anand, Janak Kapuriya, Apoorv Singh, Jay Saraf, Naman Lal, Astha Verma, Rushali Gupta, Rajiv Shah","While Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve human-level performance in various tasks, they continue to face challenges when it comes to effectively tackling multi-step physics reasoning tasks. To identify the shortcomings of existing models and facilitate further research in this area, we curated a novel dataset, MM-PhyQA, which comprises well-constructed, high schoollevel multimodal physics problems. By evaluating the performance of contemporary LLMs that are publicly available, both with and without the incorporation of multimodal elements in these problems, we aim to shed light on their capabilities. For generating answers for questions consisting of multimodal input (in this case, images and text) we employed Zero-shot prediction using GPT-4 and utilized LLaVA (LLaVA and LLaVA-1.5), the latter of which were fine-tuned on our dataset. For evaluating the performance of LLMs consisting solely of textual input, we tested the performance of the base and fine-tuned versions of the Mistral-7B and LLaMA2-7b models. We also showcased the performance of the novel Multi-Image Chain-of-Thought (MI-CoT) Prompting technique, which when used to train LLaVA-1.5 13b yielded the best results when tested on our dataset, with superior scores in most metrics and the highest accuracy of 71.65% on the test set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08704v1,2024-04

Leveraging Data Augmentation for Process Information Extraction,"Julian Neuberger, Leonie Doll, Benedict Engelmann, Lars Ackermann, Stefan Jablonski","Business Process Modeling projects often require formal process models as a central component. High costs associated with the creation of such formal process models motivated many different fields of research aimed at automated generation of process models from readily available data. These include process mining on event logs, and generating business process models from natural language texts. Research in the latter field is regularly faced with the problem of limited data availability, hindering both evaluation and development of new techniques, especially learning-based ones.   To overcome this data scarcity issue, in this paper we investigate the application of data augmentation for natural language text data. Data augmentation methods are well established in machine learning for creating new, synthetic data without human assistance. We find that many of these methods are applicable to the task of business process information extraction, improving the accuracy of extraction. Our study shows, that data augmentation is an important component in enabling machine learning methods for the task of business process model generation from natural language text, where currently mostly rule-based systems are still state of the art. Simple data augmentation techniques improved the $F_1$ score of mention extraction by 2.9 percentage points, and the $F_1$ of relation extraction by $4.5$. To better understand how data augmentation alters human annotated texts, we analyze the resulting text, visualizing and discussing the properties of augmented textual data.

Interactive Prompt Debugging with Sequence Salience,"Ian Tenney, Ryan Mullins, Bin Du, Shree Pandya, Minsuk Kahng, Lucas Dixon","We present Sequence Salience, a visual tool for interactive prompt debugging with input salience methods. Sequence Salience builds on widely used salience methods for text classification and single-token prediction, and extends this to a system tailored for debugging complex LLM prompts.

Hierarchies in knowledge graphs provide significant benefit in improving understanding and compartmentalization of the data within a knowledge graph. This work leverages large language models to generate and augment hierarchies in an existing knowledge graph. For small (<100,000 node) domain-specific KGs, we find that a combination of few-shot prompting with one-shot generation works well, while larger KG may require cyclical generation.

Laissez-Faire Harms: Algorithmic Biases in Generative Language Models,"Evan Shieh, Faye-Marie Vassel, Cassidy Sugimoto, Thema Monroe-White","The rapid deployment of generative language models (LMs) has raised concerns about social biases affecting the well-being of diverse consumers. The extant literature on generative LMs has primarily examined bias via explicit identity prompting. However, prior research on bias in earlier language-based technology platforms, including search engines, has shown that discrimination can occur even when identity terms are not specified explicitly. Studies of bias in LM responses to open-ended prompts (where identity classifications are left unspecified) are lacking and have not yet been grounded in end-consumer harms. Here, we advance studies of generative LM bias by considering a broader set of natural use cases via open-ended prompting. In this ""laissez-faire"" setting, we find that synthetically generated texts from five of the most pervasive LMs (ChatGPT3.5, ChatGPT4, Claude2.0, Llama2, and PaLM2) perpetuate harms of omission, subordination, and stereotyping for minoritized individuals with intersectional race, gender, and/or sexual orientation identities (AI/AN, Asian, Black, Latine, MENA, NH/PI, Female, Non-binary, Queer). We find widespread evidence of bias to an extent that such individuals are hundreds to thousands of times more likely to encounter LM-generated outputs that portray their identities in a subordinated manner compared to representative or empowering portrayals. We also document a prevalence of stereotypes (e.g. perpetual foreigner) in LM-generated outputs that are known to trigger psychological harms that disproportionately affect minoritized individuals. These include stereotype threat, which leads to impaired cognitive performance and increased negative self-perception. Our findings highlight the urgent need to protect consumers from discriminatory harms caused by language models and invest in critical AI education programs tailored towards empowering diverse consumers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07475v2,2024-04
Structure-aware Fine-tuning for Code Pre-trained Models,"Jiayi Wu, Renyu Zhu, Nuo Chen, Qiushi Sun, Xiang Li, Ming Gao","Over the past few years, we have witnessed remarkable advancements in Code Pre-trained Models (CodePTMs). These models achieved excellent representation capabilities by designing structure-based pre-training tasks for code. However, how to enhance the absorption of structural knowledge when fine-tuning CodePTMs still remains a significant challenge. To fill this gap, in this paper, we present Structure-aware Fine-tuning (SAT), a novel structure-enhanced and plug-and-play fine-tuning method for CodePTMs. We first propose a structure loss to quantify the difference between the information learned by CodePTMs and the knowledge extracted from code structure. Specifically, we use the attention scores extracted from Transformer layer as the learned structural information, and the shortest path length between leaves in abstract syntax trees as the structural knowledge. Subsequently, multi-task learning is introduced to improve the performance of fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on four pre-trained models and two generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method as a plug-and-play solution. Furthermore, we observed that SAT can benefit CodePTMs more with limited training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07471v1,2024-04
Scalable Language Model with Generalized Continual Learning,"Bohao Peng, Zhuotao Tian, Shu Liu, Mingchang Yang, Jiaya Jia","Continual learning has gained increasing importance as it facilitates the acquisition and refinement of scalable knowledge and skills in language models. However, existing methods typically encounter strict limitations and challenges in real-world scenarios, such as reliance on experience replay, optimization constraints, and inference task-ID. In this study, we introduce the Scalable Language Model (SLM) to overcome these limitations within a more challenging and generalized setting, representing a significant advancement toward practical applications for continual learning. Specifically, we propose the Joint Adaptive Re-Parameterization (JARe), integrated with Dynamic Task-related Knowledge Retrieval (DTKR), to enable adaptive adjustment of language models based on specific downstream tasks. This approach leverages the task distribution within the vector space, aiming to achieve a smooth and effortless continual learning process. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse backbones and benchmarks, achieving effective continual learning in both full-set and few-shot scenarios with minimal forgetting. Moreover, while prior research primarily focused on a single task type such as classification, our study goes beyond, with the large language model, i.e., LLaMA-2, to explore the effects across diverse domains and task types, such that a single language model can be decently scaled to broader applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07470v1,2024-04

Through the examination of the literature, we identify a lack of agreement with the term `hallucination' in the field of NLP. Additionally, to compliment our audit, we conduct a survey with 171 practitioners from the field of NLP and AI to capture varying perspectives on hallucination. Our analysis calls for the necessity of explicit definitions and frameworks outlining hallucination within NLP, highlighting potential challenges, and our survey inputs provide a thematic understanding of the influence and ramifications of hallucination in society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07461v2,2024-04
Transferable and Principled Efficiency for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation,"Jingxuan Xu, Wuyang Chen, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei","Recent success of pre-trained foundation vision-language models makes Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) possible. Despite the promising performance, this approach introduces heavy computational overheads for two challenges: 1) large model sizes of the backbone; 2) expensive costs during the fine-tuning. These challenges hinder this OVS strategy from being widely applicable and affordable in real-world scenarios. Although traditional methods such as model compression and efficient fine-tuning can address these challenges, they often rely on heuristics. This means that their solutions cannot be easily transferred and necessitate re-training on different models, which comes at a cost. In the context of efficient OVS, we target achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than prior OVS works based on large vision-language foundation models, by utilizing smaller models that incur lower training costs. The core strategy is to make our efficiency principled and thus seamlessly transferable from one OVS framework to others without further customization. Comprehensive experiments on diverse OVS benchmarks demonstrate our superior trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computation costs over previous works.

Behavior Trees Enable Structured Programming of Language Model Agents,Richard Kelley,"Language models trained on internet-scale data sets have shown an impressive ability to solve problems in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. However, experience is showing that these models are frequently brittle in unexpected ways, and require significant scaffolding to ensure that they operate correctly in the larger systems that comprise ""language-model agents."" In this paper, we argue that behavior trees provide a unifying framework for combining language models with classical AI and traditional programming. We introduce Dendron, a Python library for programming language model agents using behavior trees. We demonstrate the approach embodied by Dendron in three case studies: building a chat agent, a camera-based infrastructure inspection agent for use on a mobile robot or vehicle, and an agent that has been built to satisfy safety constraints that it did not receive through instruction tuning or RLHF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07439v1,2024-04
JetMoE: Reaching Llama2 Performance with 0.1M Dollars,"Yikang Shen, Zhen Guo, Tianle Cai, Zengyi Qin","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results, but their increasing resource demand has become a major obstacle to the development of powerful and accessible super-human intelligence. This report introduces JetMoE-8B, a new LLM trained with less than $0.1 million, using 1.25T tokens from carefully mixed open-source corpora and 30,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite its low cost, the JetMoE-8B demonstrates impressive performance, with JetMoE-8B outperforming the Llama2-7B model and JetMoE-8B-Chat surpassing the Llama2-13B-Chat model. These results suggest that LLM training can be much more cost-effective than generally thought. JetMoE-8B is based on an efficient Sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture, composed of attention and feedforward experts. Both layers are sparsely activated, allowing JetMoE-8B to have 8B parameters while only activating 2B for each input token, reducing inference computation by about 70% compared to Llama2-7B. Moreover, JetMoE-8B is highly open and academia-friendly, using only public datasets and training code. All training parameters and data mixtures have been detailed in this report to facilitate future efforts in the development of open foundation models.

Analyzing the Performance of Large Language Models on Code Summarization,"Rajarshi Haldar, Julia Hockenmaier","Large language models (LLMs) such as Llama 2 perform very well on tasks that involve both natural language and source code, particularly code summarization and code generation. We show that for the task of code summarization, the performance of these models on individual examples often depends on the amount of (subword) token overlap between the code and the corresponding reference natural language descriptions in the dataset. This token overlap arises because the reference descriptions in standard datasets (corresponding to docstrings in large code bases) are often highly similar to the names of the functions they describe. We also show that this token overlap occurs largely in the function names of the code and compare the relative performance of these models after removing function names versus removing code structure. We also show that using multiple evaluation metrics like BLEU and BERTScore gives us very little additional insight since these metrics are highly correlated with each other.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08018v1,2024-04
Deep Generative Sampling in the Dual Divergence Space: A Data-efficient & Interpretative Approach for Generative AI,"Sahil Garg, Anderson Schneider, Anant Raj, Kashif Rasul, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Sneihil Gopal, Amit Dhurandhar, Guillermo Cecchi, Irina Rish","Building on the remarkable achievements in generative sampling of natural images, we propose an innovative challenge, potentially overly ambitious, which involves generating samples of entire multivariate time series that resemble images. However, the statistical challenge lies in the small sample size, sometimes consisting of a few hundred subjects. This issue is especially problematic for deep generative models that follow the conventional approach of generating samples from a canonical distribution and then decoding or denoising them to match the true data distribution. In contrast, our method is grounded in information theory and aims to implicitly characterize the distribution of images, particularly the (global and local) dependency structure between pixels. We achieve this by empirically estimating its KL-divergence in the dual form with respect to the respective marginal distribution. This enables us to perform generative sampling directly in the optimized 1-D dual divergence space. Specifically, in the dual space, training samples representing the data distribution are embedded in the form of various clusters between two end points. In theory, any sample embedded between those two end points is in-distribution w.r.t. the data distribution. Our key idea for generating novel samples of images is to interpolate between the clusters via a walk as per gradients of the dual function w.r.t. the data dimensions. In addition to the data efficiency gained from direct sampling, we propose an algorithm that offers a significant reduction in sample complexity for estimating the divergence of the data distribution with respect to the marginal distribution. We provide strong theoretical guarantees along with an extensive empirical evaluation using many real-world datasets from diverse domains, establishing the superiority of our approach w.r.t. state-of-the-art deep learning methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07377v1,2024-04

We're Calling an Intervention: Exploring the Fundamental Hurdles in Adapting Language Models to Nonstandard Text,"Aarohi Srivastava, David Chiang","We present a suite of experiments that allow us to understand the underlying challenges of language model adaptation to nonstandard text. We do so by designing interventions that approximate several types of linguistic variation and their interactions with existing biases of language models. Applying our interventions during language model adaptation with varying size and nature of training data, we gain important insights into when knowledge transfer can be successful, as well as the aspects of linguistic variation that are particularly difficult for language models to deal with. For instance, on text with character-level variation, performance improves with even a few training examples but approaches a plateau, suggesting that more data is not the solution. In contrast, on text with variation involving new words or meanings, far more data is needed, but it leads to a massive breakthrough in performance. Our findings reveal that existing models lack the necessary infrastructure to handle diverse forms of nonstandard text and linguistic variation, guiding the development of more resilient language modeling techniques for the future. We make the code for our interventions, which can be applied to any English text data, publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07304v2,2024-04
DyKnow: Dynamically Verifying Time-Sensitive Factual Knowledge in LLMs,"Seyed Mahed Mousavi, Simone Alghisi, Giuseppe Riccardi","LLMs acquire knowledge from massive data snapshots collected at different timestamps. Their knowledge is then commonly evaluated using static benchmarks. However, factual knowledge is generally subject to time-sensitive changes, and static benchmarks cannot address those cases. We present an approach to dynamically evaluate the knowledge in LLMs and their time-sensitiveness against Wikidata, a publicly available up-to-date knowledge graph. We evaluate the time-sensitive knowledge in twenty-four private and open-source LLMs, as well as the effectiveness of four editing methods in updating the outdated facts. Our results show that 1) outdatedness is a critical problem across state-of-the-art LLMs; 2) LLMs output inconsistent answers when prompted with slight variations of the question prompt; and 3) the performance of the state-of-the-art knowledge editing algorithms is very limited, as they can not reduce the cases of outdatedness and output inconsistency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08700v3,2024-04
UMBRAE: Unified Multimodal Brain Decoding,"Weihao Xia, Raoul de Charette, Cengiz Öztireli, Jing-Hao Xue","We address prevailing challenges of the brain-powered research, departing from the observation that the literature hardly recover accurate spatial information and require subject-specific models. To address these challenges, we propose UMBRAE, a unified multimodal decoding of brain signals. First, to extract instance-level conceptual and spatial details from neural signals, we introduce an efficient universal brain encoder for multimodal-brain alignment and recover object descriptions at multiple levels of granularity from subsequent multimodal large language model (MLLM). Second, we introduce a cross-subject training strategy mapping subject-specific features to a common feature space. This allows a model to be trained on multiple subjects without extra resources, even yielding superior results compared to subject-specific models. Further, we demonstrate this supports weakly-supervised adaptation to new subjects, with only a fraction of the total training data. Experiments demonstrate that UMBRAE not only achieves superior results in the newly introduced tasks but also outperforms methods in well established tasks.

PoliTune: Analyzing the Impact of Data Selection and Fine-Tuning on Economic and Political Biases in Large Language Models,"Ahmed Agiza, Mohamed Mostagir, Sherief Reda","In an era where language models are increasingly integrated into decision-making and communication, understanding the biases within Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes imperative, especially when these models are applied in the economic and political domains. This work investigates the impact of fine-tuning and data selection on economic and political biases in LLMs. In this context, we introduce PoliTune, a fine-tuning methodology to explore the systematic aspects of aligning LLMs with specific ideologies, mindful of the biases that arise from their extensive training on diverse datasets. Distinct from earlier efforts that either focus on smaller models or entail resource-intensive pre-training, PoliTune employs Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, which allow for the alignment of LLMs with targeted ideologies by modifying a small subset of parameters. We introduce a systematic method for using the open-source LLM Llama3-70B for dataset selection, annotation, and synthesizing a preferences dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the model with a given political ideology. We assess the effectiveness of PoliTune through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of aligning open-source LLMs (Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B) to different ideologies. Our work analyzes the potential of embedding specific biases into LLMs and contributes to the dialogue on the ethical application of AI, highlighting the importance of deploying AI in a manner that aligns with societal values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08699v3,2024-04
Leave No Context Behind: Efficient Infinite Context Transformers with Infini-attention,"Tsendsuren Munkhdalai, Manaal Faruqui, Siddharth Gopal","This work introduces an efficient method to scale Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to infinitely long inputs with bounded memory and computation. A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention. The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context block retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables fast streaming inference for LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07143v2,2024-04
Towards Robustness of Text-to-Visualization Translation against Lexical and Phrasal Variability,"Jinwei Lu, Yuanfeng Song, Haodi Zhang, Chen Zhang, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong","Text-to-Vis is an emerging task in the natural language processing (NLP) area that aims to automatically generate data visualizations from natural language questions (NLQs). Despite their progress, existing text-to-vis models often heavily rely on lexical matching between words in the questions and tokens in data schemas. This overreliance on lexical matching may lead to a diminished level of model robustness against input variations. In this study, we thoroughly examine the robustness of current text-to-vis models, an area that has not previously been explored. In particular, we construct the first robustness dataset nvBench-Rob, which contains diverse lexical and phrasal variations based on the original text-to-vis benchmark nvBench. Then, we found that the performance of existing text-to-vis models on this new dataset dramatically drops, implying that these methods exhibit inadequate robustness overall. Finally, we propose a novel framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, named GRED, specifically designed to address input perturbations in these two variants. The framework consists of three parts: NLQ-Retrieval Generator, Visualization Query-Retrieval Retuner and Annotation-based Debugger, which are used to tackle the challenges posed by natural language variants, programming style differences and data schema variants, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model RGVisNet in the Text-to-Vis field, GRED performs better in terms of model robustness, with a 32% increase in accuracy on the proposed nvBench-Rob dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07135v2,2024-04
Lossless Acceleration of Large Language Model via Adaptive N-gram Parallel Decoding,"Jie Ou, Yueming Chen, Wenhong Tian","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities, they are hindered by significant resource consumption and considerable latency due to autoregressive processing. In this study, we introduce Adaptive N-gram Parallel Decoding (ANPD), an innovative and lossless approach that accelerates inference by allowing the simultaneous generation of multiple tokens. ANPD incorporates a two-stage approach: it begins with a rapid drafting phase that employs an N-gram module, which adapts based on the current interactive context, followed by a verification phase, during which the original LLM assesses and confirms the proposed tokens. Consequently, ANPD preserves the integrity of the LLM's original output while enhancing processing speed. We further leverage a multi-level architecture for the N-gram module to enhance the precision of the initial draft, consequently reducing inference latency. ANPD eliminates the need for retraining or extra GPU memory, making it an efficient and plug-and-play enhancement. In our experiments, models such as LLaMA and its fine-tuned variants have shown speed improvements up to 3.67x, validating the effectiveness of our proposed ANPD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08698v2,2024-04
Continuous Language Model Interpolation for Dynamic and Controllable Text Generation,"Sara Kangaslahti, David Alvarez-Melis","As large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity for a variety of use cases, making them adaptable and controllable has become increasingly important, especially for user-facing applications. While the existing literature on LLM adaptation primarily focuses on finding a model (or models) that optimizes a single predefined objective, here we focus on the challenging case where the model must dynamically adapt to diverse -- and often changing -- user preferences. For this, we leverage adaptation methods based on linear weight interpolation, casting them as continuous multi-domain interpolators that produce models with specific prescribed generation characteristics on-the-fly. Specifically, we use low-rank updates to fine-tune a base model to various different domains, yielding a set of anchor models with distinct generation profiles. Then, we use the weight updates of these anchor models to parametrize the entire (infinite) class of models contained within their convex hull. We empirically show that varying the interpolation weights yields predictable and consistent change in the model outputs with respect to all of the controlled attributes. We find that there is little entanglement between most attributes and identify and discuss the pairs of attributes for which this is not the case. Our results suggest that linearly interpolating between the weights of fine-tuned models facilitates predictable, fine-grained control of model outputs with respect to multiple stylistic characteristics simultaneously.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07117v1,2024-04
From Model-centered to Human-Centered: Revision Distance as a Metric for Text Evaluation in LLMs-based Applications,"Yongqiang Ma, Lizhi Qing, Jiawei Liu, Yangyang Kang, Yue Zhang, Wei Lu, Xiaozhong Liu, Qikai Cheng","Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is fundamental, particularly in the context of practical applications. Conventional evaluation methods, typically designed primarily for LLM development, yield numerical scores that ignore the user experience. Therefore, our study shifts the focus from model-centered to human-centered evaluation in the context of AI-powered writing assistance applications. Our proposed metric, termed ``Revision Distance,'' utilizes LLMs to suggest revision edits that mimic the human writing process. It is determined by counting the revision edits generated by LLMs. Benefiting from the generated revision edit details, our metric can provide a self-explained text evaluation result in a human-understandable manner beyond the context-independent score. Our results show that for the easy-writing task, ``Revision Distance'' is consistent with established metrics (ROUGE, Bert-score, and GPT-score), but offers more insightful, detailed feedback and better distinguishes between texts. Moreover, in the context of challenging academic writing tasks, our metric still delivers reliable evaluations where other metrics tend to struggle. Furthermore, our metric also holds significant potential for scenarios lacking reference texts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07108v2,2024-04
Graph Chain-of-Thought: Augmenting Large Language Models by Reasoning on Graphs,"Bowen Jin, Chulin Xie, Jiawei Zhang, Kashob Kumar Roy, Yu Zhang, Zheng Li, Ruirui Li, Xianfeng Tang, Suhang Wang, Yu Meng, Jiawei Han","Large language models (LLMs), while exhibiting exceptional performance, suffer from hallucinations, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing works propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from external knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue. However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (Graph-CoT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each Graph-CoT iteration consists of three sub-steps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on GRBench, where Graph-CoT outperforms the baselines consistently. The code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Graph-CoT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07103v3,2024-04
Dynamic Generation of Personalities with Large Language Models,"Jianzhi Liu, Hexiang Gu, Tianyu Zheng, Liuyu Xiang, Huijia Wu, Jie Fu, Zhaofeng He","In the realm of mimicking human deliberation, large language models (LLMs) show promising performance, thereby amplifying the importance of this research area. Deliberation is influenced by both logic and personality. However, previous studies predominantly focused on the logic of LLMs, neglecting the exploration of personality aspects. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Personality Generation (DPG), a dynamic personality generation method based on Hypernetworks. Initially, we embed the Big Five personality theory into GPT-4 to form a personality assessment machine, enabling it to evaluate characters' personality traits from dialogues automatically. We propose a new metric to assess personality generation capability based on this evaluation method. Then, we use this personality assessment machine to evaluate dialogues in script data, resulting in a personality-dialogue dataset. Finally, we fine-tune DPG on the personality-dialogue dataset. Experiments prove that DPG's personality generation capability is stronger after fine-tuning on this dataset than traditional fine-tuning methods, surpassing prompt-based GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07084v1,2024-04
Exploring Concept Depth: How Large Language Models Acquire Knowledge at Different Layers?,"Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Jingyuan Huang, Qingcheng Zeng, Zhenting Wang, Wenyue Hua, Haiyan Zhao, Kai Mei, Yanda Meng, Kaize Ding, Fan Yang, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of ``Concept Depth'' to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Luckfort/CD}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07066v6,2024-04
Groundedness in Retrieval-augmented Long-form Generation: An Empirical Study,Alessandro Stolfo,"We present an empirical study of groundedness in long-form question answering (LFQA) by retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs). In particular, we evaluate whether every generated sentence is grounded in the retrieved documents or the model's pre-training data. Across 3 datasets and 4 model families, our findings reveal that a significant fraction of generated sentences are consistently ungrounded, even when those sentences contain correct ground-truth answers. Additionally, we examine the impacts of factors such as model size, decoding strategy, and instruction tuning on groundedness. Our results show that while larger models tend to ground their outputs more effectively, a significant portion of correct answers remains compromised by hallucinations. This study provides novel insights into the groundedness challenges in LFQA and underscores the necessity for more robust mechanisms in LLMs to mitigate the generation of ungrounded content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07060v1,2024-04
Meta4XNLI: A Crosslingual Parallel Corpus for Metaphor Detection and Interpretation,"Elisa Sanchez-Bayona, Rodrigo Agerri","Metaphors, although occasionally unperceived, are ubiquitous in our everyday language. Thus, it is crucial for Language Models to be able to grasp the underlying meaning of this kind of figurative language. In this work, we present Meta4XNLI, a novel parallel dataset for the tasks of metaphor detection and interpretation that contains metaphor annotations in both Spanish and English. We investigate language models' metaphor identification and understanding abilities through a series of monolingual and cross-lingual experiments by leveraging our proposed corpus. In order to comprehend how these non-literal expressions affect models' performance, we look over the results and perform an error analysis. Additionally, parallel data offers many potential opportunities to investigate metaphor transferability between these languages and the impact of translation on the development of multilingual annotated resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07053v1,2024-04
A Computational Analysis of the Dehumanisation of Migrants from Syria and Ukraine in Slovene News Media,"Jaya Caporusso, Damar Hoogland, Mojca Brglez, Boshko Koloski, Matthew Purver, Senja Pollak","Dehumanisation involves the perception and or treatment of a social group's members as less than human. This phenomenon is rarely addressed with computational linguistic techniques. We adapt a recently proposed approach for English, making it easier to transfer to other languages and to evaluate, introducing a new sentiment resource, the use of zero-shot cross-lingual valence and arousal detection, and a new method for statistical significance testing. We then apply it to study attitudes to migration expressed in Slovene newspapers, to examine changes in the Slovene discourse on migration between the 2015-16 migration crisis following the war in Syria and the 2022-23 period following the war in Ukraine. We find that while this discourse became more negative and more intense over time, it is less dehumanising when specifically addressing Ukrainian migrants compared to others.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07036v1,2024-04
Improving Language Model Reasoning with Self-motivated Learning,"Yunlong Feng, Yang Xu, Libo Qin, Yasheng Wang, Wanxiang Che","Large-scale high-quality training data is important for improving the performance of models. After trained with data that has rationales (reasoning steps), models gain reasoning capability. However, the dataset with high-quality rationales is relatively scarce due to the high annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose \textit{Self-motivated Learning} framework. The framework motivates the model itself to automatically generate rationales on existing datasets. Based on the inherent rank from correctness across multiple rationales, the model learns to generate better rationales, leading to higher reasoning capability. Specifically, we train a reward model with the rank to evaluate the quality of rationales, and improve the performance of reasoning through reinforcement learning. Experiment results of Llama2 7B on multiple reasoning datasets show that our method significantly improves the reasoning ability of models, even outperforming text-davinci-002 in some datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07017v3,2024-04
A Mathematical Theory for Learning Semantic Languages by Abstract Learners,"Kuo-Yu Liao, Cheng-Shang Chang, Y. -W. Peter Hong","Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the emergence of capabilities (learned skills) when the number of system parameters and the size of training data surpass certain thresholds. The exact mechanisms behind such phenomena are not fully understood and remain a topic of active research. Inspired by the skill-text bipartite graph model proposed by Arora and Goyal for modeling semantic languages, we develop a mathematical theory to explain the emergence of learned skills, taking the learning (or training) process into account. Our approach models the learning process for skills in the skill-text bipartite graph as an iterative decoding process in Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes and Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA). Using density evolution analysis, we demonstrate the emergence of learned skills when the ratio of the number of training texts to the number of skills exceeds a certain threshold. Our analysis also yields a scaling law for testing errors relative to this ratio. Upon completion of the training, the association of learned skills can also be acquired to form a skill association graph. We use site percolation analysis to derive the conditions for the existence of a giant component in the skill association graph. Our analysis can also be extended to the setting with a hierarchy of skills, where a fine-tuned model is built upon a foundation model. It is also applicable to the setting with multiple classes of skills and texts. As an important application, we propose a method for semantic compression and discuss its connections to semantic communication.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07009v3,2024-04
WordDecipher: Enhancing Digital Workspace Communication with Explainable AI for Non-native English Speakers,"Yuexi Chen, Zhicheng Liu","Non-native English speakers (NNES) face challenges in digital workspace communication (e.g., emails, Slack messages), often inadvertently translating expressions from their native languages, which can lead to awkward or incorrect usage. Current AI-assisted writing tools are equipped with fluency enhancement and rewriting suggestions; however, NNES may struggle to grasp the subtleties among various expressions, making it challenging to choose the one that accurately reflects their intent. Such challenges are exacerbated in high-stake text-based communications, where the absence of non-verbal cues heightens the risk of misinterpretation. By leveraging the latest advancements in large language models (LLM) and word embeddings, we propose WordDecipher, an explainable AI-assisted writing tool to enhance digital workspace communication for NNES. WordDecipher not only identifies the perceived social intentions detected in users' writing, but also generates rewriting suggestions aligned with users' intended messages, either numerically or by inferring from users' writing in their native language. Then, WordDecipher provides an overview of nuances to help NNES make selections. Through a usage scenario, we demonstrate how WordDecipher can significantly enhance an NNES's ability to communicate her request, showcasing its potential to transform workspace communication for NNES.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07005v1,2024-04
LM Transparency Tool: Interactive Tool for Analyzing Transformer Language Models,"Igor Tufanov, Karen Hambardzumyan, Javier Ferrando, Elena Voita","We present the LM Transparency Tool (LM-TT), an open-source interactive toolkit for analyzing the internal workings of Transformer-based language models. Differently from previously existing tools that focus on isolated parts of the decision-making process, our framework is designed to make the entire prediction process transparent, and allows tracing back model behavior from the top-layer representation to very fine-grained parts of the model. Specifically, it (1) shows the important part of the whole input-to-output information flow, (2) allows attributing any changes done by a model block to individual attention heads and feed-forward neurons, (3) allows interpreting the functions of those heads or neurons. A crucial part of this pipeline is showing the importance of specific model components at each step. As a result, we are able to look at the roles of model components only in cases where they are important for a prediction. Since knowing which components should be inspected is key for analyzing large models where the number of these components is extremely high, we believe our tool will greatly support the interpretability community both in research settings and in practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07004v1,2024-04
Event Grounded Criminal Court View Generation with Cooperative (Large) Language Models,"Linan Yue, Qi Liu, Lili Zhao, Li Wang, Weibo Gao, Yanqing An","With the development of legal intelligence, Criminal Court View Generation has attracted much attention as a crucial task of legal intelligence, which aims to generate concise and coherent texts that summarize case facts and provide explanations for verdicts. Existing researches explore the key information in case facts to yield the court views. Most of them employ a coarse-grained approach that partitions the facts into broad segments (e.g., verdict-related sentences) to make predictions. However, this approach fails to capture the complex details present in the case facts, such as various criminal elements and legal events. To this end, in this paper, we propose an Event Grounded Generation (EGG) method for criminal court view generation with cooperative (Large) Language Models, which introduces the fine-grained event information into the generation. Specifically, we first design a LLMs-based extraction method that can extract events in case facts without massive annotated events. Then, we incorporate the extracted events into court view generation by merging case facts and events. Besides, considering the computational burden posed by the use of LLMs in the extraction phase of EGG, we propose a LLMs-free EGG method that can eliminate the requirement for event extraction using LLMs in the inference phase. Extensive experimental results on a real-world dataset clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07001v3,2024-04
XNLIeu: a dataset for cross-lingual NLI in Basque,"Maite Heredia, Julen Etxaniz, Muitze Zulaika, Xabier Saralegi, Jeremy Barnes, Aitor Soroa","XNLI is a popular Natural Language Inference (NLI) benchmark widely used to evaluate cross-lingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities across languages. In this paper, we expand XNLI to include Basque, a low-resource language that can greatly benefit from transfer-learning approaches. The new dataset, dubbed XNLIeu, has been developed by first machine-translating the English XNLI corpus into Basque, followed by a manual post-edition step. We have conducted a series of experiments using mono- and multilingual LLMs to assess a) the effect of professional post-edition on the MT system; b) the best cross-lingual strategy for NLI in Basque; and c) whether the choice of the best cross-lingual strategy is influenced by the fact that the dataset is built by translation. The results show that post-edition is necessary and that the translate-train cross-lingual strategy obtains better results overall, although the gain is lower when tested in a dataset that has been built natively from scratch.

Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding for Few-shot NER with Entity-aware Contrastive Learning,"Peipei Liu, Gaosheng Wang, Ying Tong, Jian Liang, Zhenquan Ding, Hongsong Zhu","Few-shot named entity recognition can identify new types of named entities based on a few labeled examples. Previous methods employing token-level or span-level metric learning suffer from the computational burden and a large number of negative sample spans. In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding for Few-shot NER with Entity-aware Contrastive Learning (MsFNER), which splits the general NER into two stages: entity-span detection and entity classification. There are 3 processes for introducing MsFNER: training, finetuning, and inference. In the training process, we train and get the best entity-span detection model and the entity classification model separately on the source domain using meta-learning, where we create a contrastive learning module to enhance entity representations for entity classification. During finetuning, we finetune the both models on the support dataset of target domain. In the inference process, for the unlabeled data, we first detect the entity-spans, then the entity-spans are jointly determined by the entity classification model and the KNN. We conduct experiments on the open FewNERD dataset and the results demonstrate the advance of MsFNER.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06970v1,2024-04

The translator was later implemented as an online web interface and as an Android app with speech input, both featuring Cyrillic-Latin script transliteration. The system translates directly, compared to other available systems that use English as a pivot, and thus take advantage of the typological similarity of the two languages.

Accelerating Inference in Large Language Models with a Unified Layer Skipping Strategy,"Yijin Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou","Recently, dynamic computation methods have shown notable acceleration for Large Language Models (LLMs) by skipping several layers of computations through elaborate heuristics or additional predictors. However, in the decoding process of existing approaches, different samples are assigned different computational budgets, which cannot guarantee a stable and precise acceleration effect. Furthermore, existing approaches generally skip multiple contiguous layers at the bottom or top of the layers, leading to a drastic change in the model's layer-wise representations, and thus a consequent performance degeneration. Therefore, we propose a Unified Layer Skipping strategy, which selects the number of layers to skip computation based solely on the target speedup ratio, and then skips the corresponding number of intermediate layer computations in a balanced manner. Since the Unified Layer Skipping strategy is independent of input samples, it naturally supports popular acceleration techniques such as batch decoding and KV caching, thus demonstrating more practicality for real-world applications. Experimental results on two common tasks, i.e., machine translation and text summarization, indicate that given a target speedup ratio, the Unified Layer Skipping strategy significantly enhances both the inference performance and the actual model throughput over existing dynamic approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06954v1,2024-04

GoEX: Perspectives and Designs Towards a Runtime for Autonomous LLM Applications,"Shishir G. Patil, Tianjun Zhang, Vivian Fang, Noppapon C., Roy Huang, Aaron Hao, Martin Casado, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Raluca Ada Popa, Ion Stoica","Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving beyond their classical role of providing information within dialogue systems to actively engaging with tools and performing actions on real-world applications and services. Today, humans verify the correctness and appropriateness of the LLM-generated outputs (e.g., code, functions, or actions) before putting them into real-world execution. This poses significant challenges as code comprehension is well known to be notoriously difficult. In this paper, we study how humans can efficiently collaborate with, delegate to, and supervise autonomous LLMs in the future. We argue that in many cases, ""post-facto validation"" - verifying the correctness of a proposed action after seeing the output - is much easier than the aforementioned ""pre-facto validation"" setting. The core concept behind enabling a post-facto validation system is the integration of an intuitive undo feature, and establishing a damage confinement for the LLM-generated actions as effective strategies to mitigate the associated risks. Using this, a human can now either revert the effect of an LLM-generated output or be confident that the potential risk is bounded. We believe this is critical to unlock the potential for LLM agents to interact with applications and services with limited (post-facto) human involvement. We describe the design and implementation of our open-source runtime for executing LLM actions, Gorilla Execution Engine (GoEX), and present open research questions towards realizing the goal of LLMs and applications interacting with each other with minimal human supervision.

GraSAME: Injecting Token-Level Structural Information to Pretrained Language Models via Graph-guided Self-Attention Mechanism,"Shuzhou Yuan, Michael Färber","Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) benefit from external knowledge stored in graph structures for various downstream tasks. However, bridging the modality gap between graph structures and text remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods like linearizing graphs for PLMs lose vital graph connectivity, whereas Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require cumbersome processes for integration into PLMs. In this work, we propose a novel graph-guided self-attention mechanism, GraSAME. GraSAME seamlessly incorporates token-level structural information into PLMs without necessitating additional alignment or concatenation efforts. As an end-to-end, lightweight multimodal module, GraSAME follows a multi-task learning strategy and effectively bridges the gap between graph and textual modalities, facilitating dynamic interactions between GNNs and PLMs. Our experiments on the graph-to-text generation task demonstrate that GraSAME outperforms baseline models and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on WebNLG datasets. Furthermore, compared to SOTA models, GraSAME eliminates the need for extra pre-training tasks to adjust graph inputs and reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 100 million.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06911v1,2024-04
Superposition Prompting: Improving and Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Thomas Merth, Qichen Fu, Mohammad Rastegari, Mahyar Najibi","Despite the successes of large language models (LLMs), they exhibit significant drawbacks, particularly when processing long contexts. Their inference cost scales quadratically with respect to sequence length, making it expensive for deployment in some real-world text processing applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the ""distraction phenomenon"", where irrelevant context in the prompt degrades output quality. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel RAG prompting methodology, *superposition prompting*, which can be directly applied to pre-trained transformer-based LLMs *without the need for fine-tuning*. At a high level, superposition prompting allows the LLM to process input documents in parallel *prompt paths*, discarding paths once they are deemed irrelevant. We demonstrate the capability of our method to simultaneously enhance time efficiency across a variety of question-answering benchmarks using multiple pre-trained LLMs. Furthermore, our technique significantly improves accuracy when the retrieved context is large relative the context the model was trained on. For example, our approach facilitates a 93x reduction in compute time while *improving* accuracy by 43% on the NaturalQuestions-Open dataset with the MPT-7B instruction-tuned model over naive RAG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06910v2,2024-04
Enhancing Question Answering for Enterprise Knowledge Bases using Large Language Models,"Feihu Jiang, Chuan Qin, Kaichun Yao, Chuyu Fang, Fuzhen Zhuang, Hengshu Zhu, Hui Xiong","Efficient knowledge management plays a pivotal role in augmenting both the operational efficiency and the innovative capacity of businesses and organizations. By indexing knowledge through vectorization, a variety of knowledge retrieval methods have emerged, significantly enhancing the efficacy of knowledge management systems. Recently, the rapid advancements in generative natural language processing technologies paved the way for generating precise and coherent answers after retrieving relevant documents tailored to user queries. However, for enterprise knowledge bases, assembling extensive training data from scratch for knowledge retrieval and generation is a formidable challenge due to the privacy and security policies of private data, frequently entailing substantial costs. To address the challenge above, in this paper, we propose EKRG, a novel Retrieval-Generation framework based on large language models (LLMs), expertly designed to enable question-answering for Enterprise Knowledge bases with limited annotation costs. Specifically, for the retrieval process, we first introduce an instruction-tuning method using an LLM to generate sufficient document-question pairs for training a knowledge retriever. This method, through carefully designed instructions, efficiently generates diverse questions for enterprise knowledge bases, encompassing both fact-oriented and solution-oriented knowledge. Additionally, we develop a relevance-aware teacher-student learning strategy to further enhance the efficiency of the training process. For the generation process, we propose a novel chain of thought (CoT) based fine-tuning method to empower the LLM-based generator to adeptly respond to user questions using retrieved documents.

Two issues prevent its application to general Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks: frequent Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) errors and the inability to faithfully generate entity names. We introduce Control-DAG, a constrained decoding algorithm for our Directed Acyclic T5 (DA-T5) model which offers lexical, vocabulary and length control. We show that Control-DAG significantly enhances DA-T5 on the Schema Guided Dialogue and the DART datasets, establishing strong NAR results for Task-Oriented Dialogue and Data-to-Text NLG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06854v1,2024-04
Simpler becomes Harder: Do LLMs Exhibit a Coherent Behavior on Simplified Corpora?,"Miriam Anschütz, Edoardo Mosca, Georg Groh","Text simplification seeks to improve readability while retaining the original content and meaning. Our study investigates whether pre-trained classifiers also maintain such coherence by comparing their predictions on both original and simplified inputs. We conduct experiments using 11 pre-trained models, including BERT and OpenAI's GPT 3.5, across six datasets spanning three languages. Additionally, we conduct a detailed analysis of the correlation between prediction change rates and simplification types/strengths. Our findings reveal alarming inconsistencies across all languages and models. If not promptly addressed, simplified inputs can be easily exploited to craft zero-iteration model-agnostic adversarial attacks with success rates of up to 50%",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06838v1,2024-04
Does Mapo Tofu Contain Coffee? Probing LLMs for Food-related Cultural Knowledge,"Li Zhou, Taelin Karidi, Wanlong Liu, Nicolas Garneau, Yong Cao, Wenyu Chen, Haizhou Li, Daniel Hershcovich","Recent studies have highlighted the presence of cultural biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet often lack a robust methodology to dissect these phenomena comprehensively. Our work aims to bridge this gap by delving into the Food domain, a universally relevant yet culturally diverse aspect of human life. We introduce FmLAMA, a multilingual dataset centered on food-related cultural facts and variations in food practices. We analyze LLMs across various architectures and configurations, evaluating their performance in both monolingual and multilingual settings. By leveraging templates in six different languages, we investigate how LLMs interact with language-specific and cultural knowledge. Our findings reveal that (1) LLMs demonstrate a pronounced bias towards food knowledge prevalent in the United States; (2) Incorporating relevant cultural context significantly improves LLMs' ability to access cultural knowledge; (3) The efficacy of LLMs in capturing cultural nuances is highly dependent on the interplay between the probing language, the specific model architecture, and the cultural context in question. This research underscores the complexity of integrating cultural understanding into LLMs and emphasizes the importance of culturally diverse datasets to mitigate biases and enhance model performance across different cultural domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06833v2,2024-04
Emotion-cause pair extraction method based on multi-granularity information and multi-module interaction,"Mingrui Fu, Weijiang Li","The purpose of emotion-cause pair extraction is to extract the pair of emotion clauses and cause clauses. On the one hand, the existing methods do not take fully into account the relationship between the emotion extraction of two auxiliary tasks. On the other hand, the existing two-stage model has the problem of error propagation. In addition, existing models do not adequately address the emotion and cause-induced locational imbalance of samples. To solve these problems, an end-to-end multitasking model (MM-ECPE) based on shared interaction between GRU, knowledge graph and transformer modules is proposed. Furthermore, based on MM-ECPE, in order to use the encoder layer to better solve the problem of imbalanced distribution of clause distances between clauses and emotion clauses, we propose a novel encoding based on BERT, sentiment lexicon, and position-aware interaction module layer of emotion motif pair retrieval model (MM-ECPE(BERT)). The model first fully models the interaction between different tasks through the multi-level sharing module, and mines the shared information between emotion-cause pair extraction and the emotion extraction and cause extraction. Second, to solve the imbalanced distribution of emotion clauses and cause clauses problem, suitable labels are screened out according to the knowledge graph path length and task-specific features are constructed so that the model can focus on extracting pairs with corresponding emotion-cause relationships. Experimental results on the ECPE benchmark dataset show that the proposed model achieves good performance, especially on position-imbalanced samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06812v1,2024-04
Not All Contexts Are Equal: Teaching LLMs Credibility-aware Generation,"Ruotong Pan, Boxi Cao, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Jia Zheng, Sirui Wang, Xunliang Cai, Le Sun","The rapid development of large language models has led to the widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates external knowledge to alleviate knowledge bottlenecks and mitigate hallucinations. However, the existing RAG paradigm inevitably suffers from the impact of flawed information introduced during the retrieval phrase, thereby diminishing the reliability and correctness of the generated outcomes. In this paper, we propose Credibility-aware Generation (CAG), a universally applicable framework designed to mitigate the impact of flawed information in RAG. At its core, CAG aims to equip models with the ability to discern and process information based on its credibility. To this end, we propose an innovative data transformation framework that generates data based on credibility, thereby effectively endowing models with the capability of CAG. Furthermore, to accurately evaluate the models' capabilities of CAG, we construct a comprehensive benchmark covering three critical real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can effectively understand and utilize credibility for generation, significantly outperform other models with retrieval augmentation, and exhibit resilience against the disruption caused by noisy documents, thereby maintaining robust performance. Moreover, our model supports customized credibility, offering a wide range of potential applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06809v3,2024-04
Personality-aware Student Simulation for Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems,"Zhengyuan Liu, Stella Xin Yin, Geyu Lin, Nancy F. Chen","Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) can provide personalized and self-paced learning experience. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) further enables better human-machine interaction, and facilitates the development of conversational ITSs in various disciplines such as math and language learning. In dialogic teaching, recognizing and adapting to individual characteristics can significantly enhance student engagement and learning efficiency. However, characterizing and simulating student's persona remain challenging in training and evaluating conversational ITSs. In this work, we propose a framework to construct profiles of different student groups by refining and integrating both cognitive and noncognitive aspects, and leverage LLMs for personality-aware student simulation in a language learning scenario. We further enhance the framework with multi-aspect validation, and conduct extensive analysis from both teacher and student perspectives. Our experimental results show that state-of-the-art LLMs can produce diverse student responses according to the given language ability and personality traits, and trigger teacher's adaptive scaffolding strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06762v1,2024-04
DiffusionDialog: A Diffusion Model for Diverse Dialog Generation with Latent Space,"Jianxiang Xiang, Zhenhua Liu, Haodong Liu, Yin Bai, Jia Cheng, Wenliang Chen","In real-life conversations, the content is diverse, and there exists the one-to-many problem that requires diverse generation. Previous studies attempted to introduce discrete or Gaussian-based continuous latent variables to address the one-to-many problem, but the diversity is limited. Recently, diffusion models have made breakthroughs in computer vision, and some attempts have been made in natural language processing. In this paper, we propose DiffusionDialog, a novel approach to enhance the diversity of dialogue generation with the help of diffusion model. In our approach, we introduce continuous latent variables into the diffusion model. The problem of using latent variables in the dialog task is how to build both an effective prior of the latent space and an inferring process to obtain the proper latent given the context. By combining the encoder and latent-based diffusion model, we encode the response's latent representation in a continuous space as the prior, instead of fixed Gaussian distribution or simply discrete ones. We then infer the latent by denoising step by step with the diffusion model. The experimental results show that our model greatly enhances the diversity of dialog responses while maintaining coherence. Furthermore, in further analysis, we find that our diffusion model achieves high inference efficiency, which is the main challenge of applying diffusion models in natural language processing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06760v1,2024-04
Language Generation in the Limit,"Jon Kleinberg, Sendhil Mullainathan","Although current large language models are complex, the most basic specifications of the underlying language generation problem itself are simple to state: given a finite set of training samples from an unknown language, produce valid new strings from the language that don't already appear in the training data. Here we ask what we can conclude about language generation using only this specification, without further assumptions. In particular, suppose that an adversary enumerates the strings of an unknown target language L that is known only to come from one of a possibly infinite list of candidates. A computational agent is trying to learn to generate from this language; we say that the agent generates from L in the limit if after some finite point in the enumeration of L, the agent is able to produce new elements that come exclusively from L and that have not yet been presented by the adversary. Our main result is that there is an agent that is able to generate in the limit for every countable list of candidate languages. This contrasts dramatically with negative results due to Gold and Angluin in a well-studied model of language learning where the goal is to identify an unknown language from samples; the difference between these results suggests that identifying a language is a fundamentally different problem than generating from it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06757v1,2024-04
Transferable and Efficient Non-Factual Content Detection via Probe Training with Offline Consistency Checking,"Xiaokang Zhang, Zijun Yao, Jing Zhang, Kaifeng Yun, Jifan Yu, Juanzi Li, Jie Tang","Detecting non-factual content is a longstanding goal to increase the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) generations. Current factuality probes, trained using humanannotated labels, exhibit limited transferability to out-of-distribution content, while online selfconsistency checking imposes extensive computation burden due to the necessity of generating multiple outputs. This paper proposes PINOSE, which trains a probing model on offline self-consistency checking results, thereby circumventing the need for human-annotated data and achieving transferability across diverse data distributions. As the consistency check process is offline, PINOSE reduces the computational burden of generating multiple responses by online consistency verification. Additionally, it examines various aspects of internal states prior to response decoding, contributing to more effective detection of factual inaccuracies. Experiment results on both factuality detection and question answering benchmarks show that PINOSE achieves surpassing results than existing factuality detection methods.

Global Contrastive Training for Multimodal Electronic Health Records with Language Supervision,"Yingbo Ma, Suraj Kolla, Zhenhong Hu, Dhruv Kaliraman, Victoria Nolan, Ziyuan Guan, Yuanfang Ren, Brooke Armfield, Tezcan Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Jeremy A. Balch, Tyler J. Loftus, Parisa Rashidi, Azra Bihorac, Benjamin Shickel","Modern electronic health records (EHRs) hold immense promise in tracking personalized patient health trajectories through sequential deep learning, owing to their extensive breadth, scale, and temporal granularity. Nonetheless, how to effectively leverage multiple modalities from EHRs poses significant challenges, given its complex characteristics such as high dimensionality, multimodality, sparsity, varied recording frequencies, and temporal irregularities. To this end, this paper introduces a novel multimodal contrastive learning framework, specifically focusing on medical time series and clinical notes. To tackle the challenge of sparsity and irregular time intervals in medical time series, the framework integrates temporal cross-attention transformers with a dynamic embedding and tokenization scheme for learning multimodal feature representations. To harness the interconnected relationships between medical time series and clinical notes, the framework equips a global contrastive loss, aligning a patient's multimodal feature representations with the corresponding discharge summaries. Since discharge summaries uniquely pertain to individual patients and represent a holistic view of the patient's hospital stay, machine learning models are led to learn discriminative multimodal features via global contrasting. Extensive experiments with a real-world EHR dataset demonstrated that our framework outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on the exemplar task of predicting the occurrence of nine postoperative complications for more than 120,000 major inpatient surgeries using multimodal data from UF health system split among three hospitals (UF Health Gainesville, UF Health Jacksonville, and UF Health Jacksonville-North).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06723v1,2024-04
Llama-VITS: Enhancing TTS Synthesis with Semantic Awareness,"Xincan Feng, Akifumi Yoshimoto","Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have seen Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing high-quality text for various purposes. Notably, in Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems, the integration of BERT for semantic token generation has underscored the importance of semantic content in producing coherent speech outputs. Despite this, the specific utility of LLMs in enhancing TTS synthesis remains considerably limited. This research introduces an innovative approach, Llama-VITS, which enhances TTS synthesis by enriching the semantic content of text using LLM. Llama-VITS integrates semantic embeddings from Llama2 with the VITS model, a leading end-to-end TTS framework. By leveraging Llama2 for the primary speech synthesis process, our experiments demonstrate that Llama-VITS matches the naturalness of the original VITS (ORI-VITS) and those incorporate BERT (BERT-VITS), on the LJSpeech dataset, a substantial collection of neutral, clear speech. Moreover, our method significantly enhances emotive expressiveness on the EmoV_DB_bea_sem dataset, a curated selection of emotionally consistent speech from the EmoV_DB dataset, highlighting its potential to generate emotive speech.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06714v3,2024-04
MathVC: An LLM-Simulated Multi-Character Virtual Classroom for Mathematics Education,"Murong Yue, Wijdane Mifdal, Yixuan Zhang, Jennifer Suh, Ziyu Yao","Mathematical modeling (MM) is considered a fundamental skill for students in STEM disciplines. Practicing the MM skill is often the most effective when students can engage in group discussion and collaborative problem-solving. However, due to unevenly distributed teachers and educational resources needed to monitor such group activities, students do not always receive equal opportunities for this practice. Excitingly, large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capability in both modeling mathematical problems and simulating characters with different traits and properties. Drawing inspiration from the advancement of LLMs, in this work, we present MATHVC, the very first LLM-powered virtual classroom containing multiple LLM-simulated student characters, with whom a human student can practice their MM skill. To encourage each LLM character's behaviors to be aligned with their specified math-relevant properties (termed ""characteristics alignment"") and the overall conversational procedure to be close to an authentic student MM discussion (termed ""conversational procedural alignment""), we proposed three innovations: integrating MM domain knowledge into the simulation, defining a symbolic schema as the ground for character simulation, and designing a meta planner at the platform level to drive the conversational procedure. Through experiments and ablation studies, we confirmed the effectiveness of our simulation approach and showed the promise for MATHVC to benefit real-life students in the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06711v1,2024-04
Apollonion: Profile-centric Dialog Agent,"Shangyu Chen, Zibo Zhao, Yuanyuan Zhao, Xiang Li","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has innovated the development of dialog agents. Specially, a well-trained LLM, as a central process unit, is capable of providing fluent and reasonable response for user's request. Besides, auxiliary tools such as external knowledge retrieval, personalized character for vivid response, short/long-term memory for ultra long context management are developed, completing the usage experience for LLM-based dialog agents. However, the above-mentioned techniques does not solve the issue of \textbf{personalization from user perspective}: agents response in a same fashion to different users, without consideration of their features, such as habits, interests and past experience. In another words, current implementation of dialog agents fail in ``knowing the user''. The capacity of well-description and representation of user is under development. In this work, we proposed a framework for dialog agent to incorporate user profiling (initialization, update): user's query and response is analyzed and organized into a structural user profile, which is latter served to provide personal and more precise response. Besides, we proposed a series of evaluation protocols for personalization: to what extend the response is personal to the different users.   The framework is named as \method{}, inspired by inscription of ``Know Yourself'' in the temple of Apollo (also known as \method{}) in Ancient Greek. Few works have been conducted on incorporating personalization into LLM, \method{} is a pioneer work on guiding LLM's response to meet individuation via the application of dialog agents, with a set of evaluation methods for measurement in personalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08692v1,2024-04
CQIL: Inference Latency Optimization with Concurrent Computation of Quasi-Independent Layers,"Longwei Zou, Qingyang Wang, Han Zhao, Jiangang Kong, Yi Yang, Yangdong Deng","The fast-growing large scale language models are delivering unprecedented performance on almost all natural language processing tasks. However, the effectiveness of large language models are reliant on an exponentially increasing number of parameters. The overwhelming computation complexity incurs a high inference latency that negatively affects user experience. Existing methods to improve inference efficiency, such as tensor parallelism and quantization, target to reduce per-layer computing latency, yet overlook the cumulative latency due to the number of layers. Recent works on reducing the cumulative latency through layer removing, however, lead to significant performance drop. Motivated by the similarity of inputs among adjacent layers, we propose to identify quasi-independent layers, which can be concurrently computed to significantly decrease inference latency. We also introduce a bypassing technique to mitigate the effect of information loss. Empirical experiments of the proposed approach on the LLaMA models confirm that Concurrent Computation of Quasi-Independent Layers (CQIL) can reduce latency by up to 48.3% on LLaMA-33B, while maintaining a close level of performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06709v2,2024-04

However, dialogue generation, along with achieving human-like naturalness in speech, continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix: Conversational Voice Mixture Generation, a novel model for zero-shot, human-like, multi-speaker, multi-round dialogue speech generation. CoVoMix first converts dialogue text into multiple streams of discrete tokens, with each token stream representing semantic information for individual talkers. These token streams are then fed into a flow-matching based acoustic model to generate mixed mel-spectrograms. Finally, the speech waveforms are produced using a HiFi-GAN model. Furthermore, we devise a comprehensive set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of dialogue modeling and generation. Our experimental results show that CoVoMix can generate dialogues that are not only human-like in their naturalness and coherence but also involve multiple talkers engaging in multiple rounds of conversation. This is exemplified by instances generated in a single channel where one speaker's utterance is seamlessly mixed with another's interjections or laughter, indicating the latter's role as an attentive listener.

Onco-Retriever: Generative Classifier for Retrieval of EHR Records in Oncology,"Shashi Kant Gupta, Aditya Basu, Bradley Taylor, Anai Kothari, Hrituraj Singh","Retrieving information from EHR systems is essential for answering specific questions about patient journeys and improving the delivery of clinical care. Despite this fact, most EHR systems still rely on keyword-based searches. With the advent of generative large language models (LLMs), retrieving information can lead to better search and summarization capabilities. Such retrievers can also feed Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines to answer any query. However, the task of retrieving information from EHR real-world clinical data contained within EHR systems in order to solve several downstream use cases is challenging due to the difficulty in creating query-document support pairs. We provide a blueprint for creating such datasets in an affordable manner using large language models. Our method results in a retriever that is 30-50 F-1 points better than propriety counterparts such as Ada and Mistral for oncology data elements. We further compare our model, called Onco-Retriever, against fine-tuned PubMedBERT model as well.

Sample-Efficient Human Evaluation of Large Language Models via Maximum Discrepancy Competition,"Kehua Feng, Keyan Ding, Kede Ma, Zhihua Wang, Qiang Zhang, Huajun Chen","The past years have witnessed a proliferation of large language models (LLMs). Yet, automated and unbiased evaluation of LLMs is challenging due to the inaccuracy of standard metrics in reflecting human preferences and the inefficiency in sampling informative and diverse test examples. While human evaluation remains the gold standard, it is expensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of testing samples. To address this problem, we propose a sample-efficient human evaluation method based on MAximum Discrepancy (MAD) competition. MAD automatically selects a small set of informative and diverse instructions, each adapted to two LLMs, whose responses are subject to three-alternative forced choice by human subjects. The pairwise comparison results are then aggregated into a global ranking using the Elo rating system. We select eight representative LLMs and compare them in terms of four skills: knowledge understanding, mathematical reasoning, writing, and coding. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a reliable and sensible ranking of LLMs' capabilities, identifies their relative strengths and weaknesses, and offers valuable insights for further LLM advancement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08008v1,2024-04

We provide an operationalization of context-dependent paraphrases, and develop a training for crowd-workers to classify paraphrases in dialog. We introduce a dataset with utterance pairs from NPR and CNN news interviews annotated for context-dependent paraphrases.

SafeGen: Mitigating Sexually Explicit Content Generation in Text-to-Image Models,"Xinfeng Li, Yuchen Yang, Jiangyi Deng, Chen Yan, Yanjiao Chen, Xiaoyu Ji, Wenyuan Xu","Text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions in recent years. However, text-to-image models may be tricked into generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, particularly in sexually explicit scenarios. Existing countermeasures mostly focus on filtering inappropriate inputs and outputs, or suppressing improper text embeddings, which can block sexually explicit content (e.g., naked) but may still be vulnerable to adversarial prompts -- inputs that appear innocent but are ill-intended. In this paper, we present SafeGen, a framework to mitigate sexual content generation by text-to-image models in a text-agnostic manner. The key idea is to eliminate explicit visual representations from the model regardless of the text input. In this way, the text-to-image model is resistant to adversarial prompts since such unsafe visual representations are obstructed from within. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets and large-scale user studies demonstrate SafeGen's effectiveness in mitigating sexually explicit content generation while preserving the high-fidelity of benign images. SafeGen outperforms eight state-of-the-art baseline methods and achieves 99.4% sexual content removal performance. Furthermore, our constructed benchmark of adversarial prompts provides a basis for future development and evaluation of anti-NSFW-generation methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06666v3,2024-04

However, LLMs' (lack of) multicultural knowledge cannot be effectively assessed with current methods for developing benchmarks. Existing multicultural evaluations primarily rely on expensive and restricted human annotations or potentially outdated internet resources. Thus, they struggle to capture the intricacy, dynamics, and diversity of cultural norms. LLM-generated benchmarks are promising, yet risk propagating the same biases they are meant to measure. To synergize the creativity and expert cultural knowledge of human annotators and the scalability and standardizability of LLM-based automation, we introduce CulturalTeaming, an interactive red-teaming system that leverages human-AI collaboration to build truly challenging evaluation dataset for assessing the multicultural knowledge of LLMs, while improving annotators' capabilities and experiences. Our study reveals that CulturalTeaming's various modes of AI assistance support annotators in creating cultural questions, that modern LLMs fail at, in a gamified manner. Importantly, the increased level of AI assistance (e.g., LLM-generated revision hints) empowers users to create more difficult questions with enhanced perceived creativity of themselves, shedding light on the promises of involving heavier AI assistance in modern evaluation dataset creation procedures. Through a series of 1-hour workshop sessions, we gather CULTURALBENCH-V0.1, a compact yet high-quality evaluation dataset with users' red-teaming attempts, that different families of modern LLMs perform with accuracy ranging from 37.7% to 72.2%, revealing a notable gap in LLMs' multicultural proficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06664v1,2024-04
Leveraging Interesting Facts to Enhance User Engagement with Conversational Interfaces,"Nikhita Vedula, Giuseppe Castellucci, Eugene Agichtein, Oleg Rokhlenko, Shervin Malmasi","Conversational Task Assistants (CTAs) guide users in performing a multitude of activities, such as making recipes. However, ensuring that interactions remain engaging, interesting, and enjoyable for CTA users is not trivial, especially for time-consuming or challenging tasks. Grounded in psychological theories of human interest, we propose to engage users with contextual and interesting statements or facts during interactions with a multi-modal CTA, to reduce fatigue and task abandonment before a task is complete. To operationalize this idea, we train a high-performing classifier (82% F1-score) to automatically identify relevant and interesting facts for users. We use it to create an annotated dataset of task-specific interesting facts for the domain of cooking. Finally, we design and validate a dialogue policy to incorporate the identified relevant and interesting facts into a conversation, to improve user engagement and task completion. Live testing on a leading multi-modal voice assistant shows that 66% of the presented facts were received positively, leading to a 40% gain in the user satisfaction rating, and a 37% increase in conversation length.

However, this simple retrieval-based test is indicative of only a superficial form of long-context understanding. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of long-context LMs, we create a new synthetic benchmark RULER with flexible configurations for customized sequence length and task complexity. RULER expands upon the vanilla NIAH test to encompass variations with diverse types and quantities of needles. Moreover, RULER introduces new task categories multi-hop tracing and aggregation to test behaviors beyond searching from context. We evaluate 17 long-context LMs with 13 representative tasks in RULER. Despite achieving nearly perfect accuracy in the vanilla NIAH test, almost all models exhibit large performance drops as the context length increases. While these models all claim context sizes of 32K tokens or greater, only half of them can maintain satisfactory performance at the length of 32K. Our analysis of Yi-34B, which supports context length of 200K, reveals large room for improvement as we increase input length and task complexity.

ToxicTrap exploits greedy based search strategies to enable fast and effective generation of toxic adversarial examples. Two novel goal function designs allow ToxicTrap to identify weaknesses in both multiclass and multilabel toxic language detectors. Our empirical results show that SOTA toxicity text classifiers are indeed vulnerable to the proposed attacks, attaining over 98\% attack success rates in multilabel cases.

The primary objective of the Khayyam Challenge is to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of LLMs that support the Persian language. Distinctive features of the Khayyam Challenge are (i) its comprehensive coverage of various topics, including literary comprehension, mathematics, sciences, logic, intelligence testing, etc., aimed at assessing different facets of LLMs such as language comprehension, reasoning, and information retrieval across various educational stages, from lower primary school to upper secondary school (ii) its inclusion of rich metadata such as human response rates, difficulty levels, and descriptive answers (iii) its utilization of new data to avoid data contamination issues prevalent in existing frameworks (iv) its use of original, non-translated data tailored for Persian speakers, ensuring the framework is free from translation challenges and errors while encompassing cultural nuances (v) its inherent scalability for future data updates and evaluations without requiring special human effort.

"What is Your Favorite Gender, MLM? Gender Bias Evaluation in Multilingual Masked Language Models","Jeongrok Yu, Seong Ug Kim, Jacob Choi, Jinho D. Choi","Bias is a disproportionate prejudice in favor of one side against another. Due to the success of transformer-based Masked Language Models (MLMs) and their impact on many NLP tasks, a systematic evaluation of bias in these models is needed more than ever. While many studies have evaluated gender bias in English MLMs, only a few works have been conducted for the task in other languages. This paper proposes a multilingual approach to estimate gender bias in MLMs from 5 languages: Chinese, English, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. Unlike previous work, our approach does not depend on parallel corpora coupled with English to detect gender bias in other languages using multilingual lexicons. Moreover, a novel model-based method is presented to generate sentence pairs for a more robust analysis of gender bias, compared to the traditional lexicon-based method. For each language, both the lexicon-based and model-based methods are applied to create two datasets respectively, which are used to evaluate gender bias in an MLM specifically trained for that language using one existing and 3 new scoring metrics. Our results show that the previous approach is data-sensitive and not stable as it does not remove contextual dependencies irrelevant to gender. In fact, the results often flip when different scoring metrics are used on the same dataset, suggesting that gender bias should be studied on a large dataset using multiple evaluation metrics for best practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06621v1,2024-04
FairPair: A Robust Evaluation of Biases in Language Models through Paired Perturbations,"Jane Dwivedi-Yu, Raaz Dwivedi, Timo Schick","The accurate evaluation of differential treatment in language models to specific groups is critical to ensuring a positive and safe user experience. An ideal evaluation should have the properties of being robust, extendable to new groups or attributes, and being able to capture biases that appear in typical usage (rather than just extreme, rare cases). Relatedly, bias evaluation should surface not only egregious biases but also ones that are subtle and commonplace, such as a likelihood for talking about appearances with regard to women. We present FairPair, an evaluation framework for assessing differential treatment that occurs during ordinary usage. FairPair operates through counterfactual pairs, but crucially, the paired continuations are grounded in the same demographic group, which ensures equivalent comparison. Additionally, unlike prior work, our method factors in the inherent variability that comes from the generation process itself by measuring the sampling variability. We present an evaluation of several commonly used generative models and a qualitative analysis that indicates a preference for discussing family and hobbies with regard to women.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06619v1,2024-04
Less is More for Improving Automatic Evaluation of Factual Consistency,"Tong Wang, Ninad Kulkarni, Yanjun Qi","Assessing the factual consistency of automatically generated texts in relation to source context is crucial for developing reliable natural language generation applications. Recent literature proposes AlignScore which uses a unified alignment model to evaluate factual consistency and substantially outperforms previous methods across many benchmark tasks. In this paper, we take a closer look of datasets used in AlignScore and uncover an unexpected finding: utilizing a smaller number of data points can actually improve performance. We process the original AlignScore training dataset to remove noise, augment with robustness-enhanced samples, and utilize a subset comprising 10\% of the data to train an improved factual consistency evaluation model, we call LIM-RA (Less Is More for Robust AlignScore). LIM-RA demonstrates superior performance, consistently outperforming AlignScore and other strong baselines like ChatGPT across four benchmarks (two utilizing traditional natural language generation datasets and two focused on large language model outputs). Our experiments show that LIM-RA achieves the highest score on 24 of the 33 test datasets, while staying competitive on the rest, establishing the new state-of-the-art benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06579v1,2024-04
Sandwich attack: Multi-language Mixture Adaptive Attack on LLMs,"Bibek Upadhayay, Vahid Behzadan","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being developed and applied, but their widespread use faces challenges. These include aligning LLMs' responses with human values to prevent harmful outputs, which is addressed through safety training methods. Even so, bad actors and malicious users have succeeded in attempts to manipulate the LLMs to generate misaligned responses for harmful questions such as methods to create a bomb in school labs, recipes for harmful drugs, and ways to evade privacy rights. Another challenge is the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, which enable the model to understand and respond in multiple languages. Consequently, attackers exploit the unbalanced pre-training datasets of LLMs in different languages and the comparatively lower model performance in low-resource languages than high-resource ones. As a result, attackers use a low-resource languages to intentionally manipulate the model to create harmful responses. Many of the similar attack vectors have been patched by model providers, making the LLMs more robust against language-based manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a new black-box attack vector called the \emph{Sandwich attack}: a multi-language mixture attack, which manipulates state-of-the-art LLMs into generating harmful and misaligned responses. Our experiments with five different models, namely Google's Bard, Gemini Pro, LLaMA-2-70-B-Chat, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and Claude-3-OPUS, show that this attack vector can be used by adversaries to generate harmful responses and elicit misaligned responses from these models. By detailing both the mechanism and impact of the Sandwich attack, this paper aims to guide future research and development towards more secure and resilient LLMs, ensuring they serve the public good while minimizing potential for misuse.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07242v1,2024-04

Recent efforts have aimed to enhance the high-resolution understanding capabilities of LVLMs, yet they remain capped at approximately 1500 x 1500 pixels and constrained to a relatively narrow resolution range. This paper represents InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD, a groundbreaking exploration into elevating LVLM resolution capabilities up to 4K HD (3840 x 1600) and beyond. Concurrently, considering the ultra-high resolution may not be necessary in all scenarios, it supports a wide range of diverse resolutions from 336 pixels to 4K standard, significantly broadening its scope of applicability. Specifically, this research advances the patch division paradigm by introducing a novel extension: dynamic resolution with automatic patch configuration. It maintains the training image aspect ratios while automatically varying patch counts and configuring layouts based on a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) (336 x 336), leading to dynamic training resolution from 336 pixels to 4K standard. Our research demonstrates that scaling training resolution up to 4K HD leads to consistent performance enhancements without hitting the ceiling of potential improvements. InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD shows superb capability that matches or even surpasses GPT-4V and Gemini Pro in 10 of the 16 benchmarks.

On the Effect of (Near) Duplicate Subwords in Language Modelling,"Anton Schäfer, Thomas Hofmann, Imanol Schlag, Tiago Pimentel","Tokenisation is a core part of language models (LMs). It involves splitting a character sequence into subwords which are assigned arbitrary indices before being served to the LM. While typically lossless, however, this process may lead to less sample efficient LM training: as it removes character-level information, it could make it harder for LMs to generalise across similar subwords, such as now and Now. We refer to such subwords as near duplicates. In this paper, we study the impact of near duplicate subwords on LM training efficiency. First, we design an experiment that gives us an upper bound to how much we should expect a model to improve if we could perfectly generalise across near duplicates. We do this by duplicating each subword in our LM's vocabulary, creating perfectly equivalent classes of subwords. Experimentally, we find that LMs need roughly 17% more data when trained in a fully duplicated setting. Second, we investigate the impact of naturally occurring near duplicates on LMs. Here, we see that merging them considerably hurts LM performance. Therefore, although subword duplication negatively impacts LM training efficiency, naturally occurring near duplicates may not be as similar as anticipated, limiting the potential for performance improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06508v3,2024-04
Comparing Two Model Designs for Clinical Note Generation; Is an LLM a Useful Evaluator of Consistency?,"Nathan Brake, Thomas Schaaf","Following an interaction with a patient, physicians are responsible for the submission of clinical documentation, often organized as a SOAP note. A clinical note is not simply a summary of the conversation but requires the use of appropriate medical terminology. The relevant information can then be extracted and organized according to the structure of the SOAP note. In this paper we analyze two different approaches to generate the different sections of a SOAP note based on the audio recording of the conversation, and specifically examine them in terms of note consistency. The first approach generates the sections independently, while the second method generates them all together. In this work we make use of PEGASUS-X Transformer models and observe that both methods lead to similar ROUGE values (less than 1% difference) and have no difference in terms of the Factuality metric. We perform a human evaluation to measure aspects of consistency and demonstrate that LLMs like Llama2 can be used to perform the same tasks with roughly the same agreement as the human annotators. Between the Llama2 analysis and the human reviewers we observe a Cohen Kappa inter-rater reliability of 0.79, 1.00, and 0.32 for consistency of age, gender, and body part injury, respectively. With this we demonstrate the usefulness of leveraging an LLM to measure quality indicators that can be identified by humans but are not currently captured by automatic metrics. This allows scaling evaluation to larger data sets, and we find that clinical note consistency improves by generating each new section conditioned on the output of all previously generated sections.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06503v1,2024-04
Pitfalls of Conversational LLMs on News Debiasing,"Ipek Baris Schlicht, Defne Altiok, Maryanne Taouk, Lucie Flek","This paper addresses debiasing in news editing and evaluates the effectiveness of conversational Large Language Models in this task. We designed an evaluation checklist tailored to news editors' perspectives, obtained generated texts from three popular conversational models using a subset of a publicly available dataset in media bias, and evaluated the texts according to the designed checklist. Furthermore, we examined the models as evaluator for checking the quality of debiased model outputs. Our findings indicate that none of the LLMs are perfect in debiasing. Notably, some models, including ChatGPT, introduced unnecessary changes that may impact the author's style and create misinformation. Lastly, we show that the models do not perform as proficiently as domain experts in evaluating the quality of debiased outputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06488v1,2024-04
Ada-LEval: Evaluating long-context LLMs with length-adaptable benchmarks,"Chonghua Wang, Haodong Duan, Songyang Zhang, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen","Recently, the large language model (LLM) community has shown increasing interest in enhancing LLMs' capability to handle extremely long documents. As various long-text techniques and model architectures emerge, the precise and detailed evaluation of models' long-text capabilities has become increasingly important. Existing long-text evaluation benchmarks, such as L-Eval and LongBench, construct long-text test sets based on open-source datasets, focusing mainly on QA and summarization tasks. These datasets include test samples of varying lengths (from 2k to 32k+) entangled together, making it challenging to assess model capabilities across different length ranges. Moreover, they do not cover the ultralong settings (100k+ tokens) that the latest LLMs claim to achieve. In this paper, we introduce Ada-LEval, a length-adaptable benchmark for evaluating the long-context understanding of LLMs. Ada-LEval includes two challenging subsets, TSort and BestAnswer, which enable a more reliable evaluation of LLMs' long context capabilities. These benchmarks support intricate manipulation of the length of test cases, and can easily produce text samples up to 128k tokens. We evaluate 4 state-of-the-art closed-source API models and 6 open-source models with Ada-LEval. The evaluation results demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs, especially in ultra-long-context settings.

Visually Descriptive Language Model for Vector Graphics Reasoning,"Zhenhailong Wang, Joy Hsu, Xingyao Wang, Kuan-Hao Huang, Manling Li, Jiajun Wu, Heng Ji","Despite significant advancements, large multimodal models (LMMs) still struggle to bridge the gap between low-level visual perception -- focusing on shapes, sizes, and layouts -- and high-level language reasoning, such as semantics and logic. This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise visual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual reasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics -- images composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web, design, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we enable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level reasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes. However, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To tackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which introduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual representation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their corresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data and represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics. This abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by foundation models for zero-shot generalization. Without human-annotated data, empirical results show that VDLM significantly improves state-of-the-art LMMs like GPT-4o on various multimodal perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses of VDLM show improved interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning. We also demonstrate a positive correlation between PVD quality and task performance.

Foundation Models to the Rescue: Deadlock Resolution in Connected Multi-Robot Systems,"Kunal Garg, Songyuan Zhang, Jacob Arkin, Chuchu Fan","Connected multi-agent robotic systems (MRS) are prone to deadlocks in an obstacle environment where the robots can get stuck away from their desired locations under a smooth low-level control policy. Without an external intervention, often in terms of a high-level command, a low-level control policy cannot resolve such deadlocks. Utilizing the generalizability and low data requirements of foundation models, this paper explores the possibility of using text-based models, i.e., large language models (LLMs), and text-and-image-based models, i.e., vision-language models (VLMs), as high-level planners for deadlock resolution. We propose a hierarchical control framework where a foundation model-based high-level planner helps to resolve deadlocks by assigning a leader to the MRS along with a set of waypoints for the MRS leader. Then, a low-level distributed control policy based on graph neural networks is executed to safely follow these waypoints, thereby evading the deadlock. We conduct extensive experiments on various MRS environments using the best available pre-trained LLMs and VLMs. We compare their performance with a graph-based planner in terms of effectiveness in helping the MRS reach their target locations and computational time. Our results illustrate that, compared to grid-based planners, the foundation models perform better in terms of the goal-reaching rate and computational time for complex environments, which helps us conclude that foundation models can assist MRS operating in complex obstacle-cluttered environments to resolve deadlocks efficiently.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06413v2,2024-04
AgentQuest: A Modular Benchmark Framework to Measure Progress and Improve LLM Agents,"Luca Gioacchini, Giuseppe Siracusano, Davide Sanvito, Kiril Gashteovski, David Friede, Roberto Bifulco, Carolin Lawrence","The advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the pursuit of LLM agents that can solve intricate, multi-step reasoning tasks. As with any research pursuit, benchmarking and evaluation are key corner stones to efficient and reliable progress. However, existing benchmarks are often narrow and simply compute overall task success. To face these issues, we propose AgentQuest -- a framework where (i) both benchmarks and metrics are modular and easily extensible through well documented and easy-to-use APIs; (ii) we offer two new evaluation metrics that can reliably track LLM agent progress while solving a task. We exemplify the utility of the metrics on two use cases wherein we identify common failure points and refine the agent architecture to obtain a significant performance increase.

Rethinking How to Evaluate Language Model Jailbreak,"Hongyu Cai, Arjun Arunasalam, Leo Y. Lin, Antonio Bianchi, Z. Berkay Celik","Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly integrated with various applications. To ensure that LLMs do not generate unsafe responses, they are aligned with safeguards that specify what content is restricted. However, such alignment can be bypassed to produce prohibited content using a technique commonly referred to as jailbreak. Different systems have been proposed to perform the jailbreak automatically. These systems rely on evaluation methods to determine whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. However, our analysis reveals that current jailbreak evaluation methods have two limitations. (1) Their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifying unsafe responses. (2) They oversimplify the jailbreak result as a binary outcome, successful or not. In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak. Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors. To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response. We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems. The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators. We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods. Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines. Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06407v3,2024-04
Wu's Method can Boost Symbolic AI to Rival Silver Medalists and AlphaGeometry to Outperform Gold Medalists at IMO Geometry,"Shiven Sinha, Ameya Prabhu, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Siddharth Bhat, Matthias Bethge","Proving geometric theorems constitutes a hallmark of visual reasoning combining both intuitive and logical skills. Therefore, automated theorem proving of Olympiad-level geometry problems is considered a notable milestone in human-level automated reasoning. The introduction of AlphaGeometry, a neuro-symbolic model trained with 100 million synthetic samples, marked a major breakthrough. It solved 25 of 30 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems whereas the reported baseline based on Wu's method solved only ten. In this note, we revisit the IMO-AG-30 Challenge introduced with AlphaGeometry, and find that Wu's method is surprisingly strong. Wu's method alone can solve 15 problems, and some of them are not solved by any of the other methods. This leads to two key findings: (i) Combining Wu's method with the classic synthetic methods of deductive databases and angle, ratio, and distance chasing solves 21 out of 30 methods by just using a CPU-only laptop with a time limit of 5 minutes per problem. Essentially, this classic method solves just 4 problems less than AlphaGeometry and establishes the first fully symbolic baseline strong enough to rival the performance of an IMO silver medalist. (ii) Wu's method even solves 2 of the 5 problems that AlphaGeometry failed to solve. Thus, by combining AlphaGeometry with Wu's method we set a new state-of-the-art for automated theorem proving on IMO-AG-30, solving 27 out of 30 problems, the first AI method which outperforms an IMO gold medalist.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06405v2,2024-04

This scenario underscores the importance of exploring the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a resource-efficient alternative. In this context, we introduce MiniCPM, specifically the 1.2B and 2.4B non-embedding parameter variants, not only excel in their respective categories but also demonstrate capabilities on par with 7B-13B LLMs. While focusing on SLMs, our approach exhibits scalability in both model and data dimensions for future LLM research. Regarding model scaling, we employ extensive model wind tunnel experiments for stable and optimal scaling. For data scaling, we introduce a Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler (LRS), conducive to continuous training and domain adaptation. We present an in-depth analysis of the intriguing training dynamics that occurred in the WSD LRS. With WSD LRS, we are now able to efficiently study data-model scaling law without extensive retraining experiments on both axes of model and data, from which we derive the much higher compute optimal data-model ratio than Chinchilla Optimal.

Event Extraction in Basque: Typologically motivated Cross-Lingual Transfer-Learning Analysis,"Mikel Zubillaga, Oscar Sainz, Ainara Estarrona, Oier Lopez de Lacalle, Eneko Agirre","Cross-lingual transfer-learning is widely used in Event Extraction for low-resource languages and involves a Multilingual Language Model that is trained in a source language and applied to the target language. This paper studies whether the typological similarity between source and target languages impacts the performance of cross-lingual transfer, an under-explored topic. We first focus on Basque as the target language, which is an ideal target language because it is typologically different from surrounding languages. Our experiments on three Event Extraction tasks show that the shared linguistic characteristic between source and target languages does have an impact on transfer quality. Further analysis of 72 language pairs reveals that for tasks that involve token classification such as entity and event trigger identification, common writing script and morphological features produce higher quality cross-lingual transfer. In contrast, for tasks involving structural prediction like argument extraction, common word order is the most relevant feature. In addition, we show that when increasing the training size, not all the languages scale in the same way in the cross-lingual setting. To perform the experiments we introduce EusIE, an event extraction dataset for Basque, which follows the Multilingual Event Extraction dataset (MEE). The dataset and code are publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06392v1,2024-04
Latent Distance Guided Alignment Training for Large Language Models,Haotian Luo,"Ensuring alignment with human preferences is a crucial characteristic of large language models (LLMs). Presently, the primary alignment methods, RLHF and DPO, require extensive human annotation, which is expensive despite their efficacy. The significant expenses associated with current alignment techniques motivate researchers to investigate the development of annotation-free alignment training methods. In pursuit of improved alignment without relying on external annotation, we introduce Latent Distance Guided Alignment Training (LD-Align). This approach seeks to align the model with a high-quality supervised fine-tune dataset using guidance from a latent space. The latent space is generated through sample reconstruction, akin to auto-encoding. Consequently, we utilize the distance between sample pairs in the latent space to guide DPO-based alignment training. Extensive experimentation and evaluation show the efficacy of our proposed method in achieving notable alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06390v2,2024-04
Model Generation with LLMs: From Requirements to UML Sequence Diagrams,"Alessio Ferrari, Sallam Abualhaija, Chetan Arora","Complementing natural language (NL) requirements with graphical models can improve stakeholders' communication and provide directions for system design. However, creating models from requirements involves manual effort. The advent of generative large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT being a notable example, offers promising avenues for automated assistance in model generation. This paper investigates the capability of ChatGPT to generate a specific type of model, i.e., UML sequence diagrams, from NL requirements. We conduct a qualitative study in which we examine the sequence diagrams generated by ChatGPT for 28 requirements documents of various types and from different domains. Observations from the analysis of the generated diagrams have systematically been captured through evaluation logs, and categorized through thematic analysis. Our results indicate that, although the models generally conform to the standard and exhibit a reasonable level of understandability, their completeness and correctness with respect to the specified requirements often present challenges. This issue is particularly pronounced in the presence of requirements smells, such as ambiguity and inconsistency. The insights derived from this study can influence the practical utilization of LLMs in the RE process, and open the door to novel RE-specific prompting strategies targeting effective model generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06371v2,2024-04
ClinLinker: Medical Entity Linking of Clinical Concept Mentions in Spanish,"Fernando Gallego, Guillermo López-García, Luis Gasco-Sánchez, Martin Krallinger, Francisco J. Veredas","Advances in natural language processing techniques, such as named entity recognition and normalization to widely used standardized terminologies like UMLS or SNOMED-CT, along with the digitalization of electronic health records, have significantly advanced clinical text analysis. This study presents ClinLinker, a novel approach employing a two-phase pipeline for medical entity linking that leverages the potential of in-domain adapted language models for biomedical text mining: initial candidate retrieval using a SapBERT-based bi-encoder and subsequent re-ranking with a cross-encoder, trained by following a contrastive-learning strategy to be tailored to medical concepts in Spanish. This methodology, focused initially on content in Spanish, substantially outperforming multilingual language models designed for the same purpose. This is true even for complex scenarios involving heterogeneous medical terminologies and being trained on a subset of the original data. Our results, evaluated using top-k accuracy at 25 and other top-k metrics, demonstrate our approach's performance on two distinct clinical entity linking Gold Standard corpora, DisTEMIST (diseases) and MedProcNER (clinical procedures), outperforming previous benchmarks by 40 points in DisTEMIST and 43 points in MedProcNER, both normalized to SNOMED-CT codes. These findings highlight our approach's ability to address language-specific nuances and set a new benchmark in entity linking, offering a potent tool for enhancing the utility of digital medical records.

"Generalizable Sarcasm Detection Is Just Around The Corner, Of Course!","Hyewon Jang, Diego Frassinelli","We tested the robustness of sarcasm detection models by examining their behavior when fine-tuned on four sarcasm datasets containing varying characteristics of sarcasm: label source (authors vs. third-party), domain (social media/online vs. offline conversations/dialogues), style (aggressive vs. humorous mocking). We tested their prediction performance on the same dataset (intra-dataset) and across different datasets (cross-dataset). For intra-dataset predictions, models consistently performed better when fine-tuned with third-party labels rather than with author labels. For cross-dataset predictions, most models failed to generalize well to the other datasets, implying that one type of dataset cannot represent all sorts of sarcasm with different styles and domains. Compared to the existing datasets, models fine-tuned on the new dataset we release in this work showed the highest generalizability to other datasets. With a manual inspection of the datasets and post-hoc analysis, we attributed the difficulty in generalization to the fact that sarcasm actually comes in different domains and styles. We argue that future sarcasm research should take the broad scope of sarcasm into account.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06357v2,2024-04
RAR-b: Reasoning as Retrieval Benchmark,"Chenghao Xiao, G Thomas Hudson, Noura Al Moubayed","Semantic textual similartiy (STS) and information retrieval tasks (IR) tasks have been the two major avenues to record the progress of embedding models in the past few years. Under the emerging Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm, we envision the need to evaluate next-level language understanding abilities of embedding models, and take a conscious look at the reasoning abilities stored in them. Addressing this, we pose the question: Can retrievers solve reasoning problems? By transforming reasoning tasks into retrieval tasks, we find that without specifically trained for reasoning-level language understanding, current state-of-the-art retriever models may still be far from being competent for playing the role of assisting LLMs, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. Moreover, albeit trained to be aware of instructions, instruction-aware IR models are often better off without instructions in inference time for reasoning tasks, posing an overlooked retriever-LLM behavioral gap for the research community to align. However, recent decoder-based embedding models show great promise in narrowing the gap, highlighting the pathway for embedding models to achieve reasoning-level language understanding. We also show that, although current off-the-shelf re-ranker models fail on these tasks, injecting reasoning abilities into them through fine-tuning still appears easier than doing so to bi-encoders, and we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks by fine-tuning a reranking model. We release Reasoning as Retrieval Benchmark (RAR-b), a holistic suite of tasks and settings to evaluate the reasoning abilities stored in retriever models.

Finding fake reviews in e-commerce platforms by using hybrid algorithms,"Mathivanan Periasamy, Rohith Mahadevan, Bagiya Lakshmi S, Raja CSP Raman, Hasan Kumar S, Jasper Jessiman","Sentiment analysis, a vital component in natural language processing, plays a crucial role in understanding the underlying emotions and opinions expressed in textual data. In this paper, we propose an innovative ensemble approach for sentiment analysis for finding fake reviews that amalgamate the predictive capabilities of Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree classifiers. Our ensemble architecture strategically combines these diverse models to capitalize on their strengths while mitigating inherent weaknesses, thereby achieving superior accuracy and robustness in fake review prediction. By combining all the models of our classifiers, the predictive performance is boosted and it also fosters adaptability to varied linguistic patterns and nuances present in real-world datasets. The metrics accounted for on fake reviews demonstrate the efficacy and competitiveness of the proposed ensemble method against traditional single-model approaches. Our findings underscore the potential of ensemble techniques in advancing the state-of-the-art in finding fake reviews using hybrid algorithms, with implications for various applications in different social media and e-platforms to find the best reviews and neglect the fake ones, eliminating puffery and bluffs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06339v1,2024-04

LLMs' Reading Comprehension Is Affected by Parametric Knowledge and Struggles with Hypothetical Statements,"Victoria Basmov, Yoav Goldberg, Reut Tsarfaty","The task of reading comprehension (RC), often implemented as context-based question answering (QA), provides a primary means to assess language models' natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities. Yet, when applied to large language models (LLMs) with extensive built-in world knowledge, this method can be deceptive. If the context aligns with the LLMs' internal knowledge, it is hard to discern whether the models' answers stem from context comprehension or from LLMs' internal information. Conversely, using data that conflicts with the models' knowledge creates erroneous trends which distort the results. To address this issue, we suggest to use RC on imaginary data, based on fictitious facts and entities. This task is entirely independent of the models' world knowledge, enabling us to evaluate LLMs' linguistic abilities without the interference of parametric knowledge. Testing ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA 2 and Mixtral on such imaginary data, we uncover a class of linguistic phenomena posing a challenge to current LLMs, involving thinking in terms of alternative, hypothetical scenarios. While all the models handle simple affirmative and negative contexts with high accuracy, they are much more prone to error when dealing with modal and conditional contexts. Crucially, these phenomena also trigger the LLMs' vulnerability to knowledge-conflicts again. In particular, while some models prove virtually unaffected by knowledge conflicts in affirmative and negative contexts, when faced with more semantically involved modal and conditional environments, they often fail to separate the text from their internal knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06283v1,2024-04
Dimensionality Reduction in Sentence Transformer Vector Databases with Fast Fourier Transform,"Vitaly Bulgakov, Alec Segal","Dimensionality reduction in vector databases is pivotal for streamlining AI data management, enabling efficient storage, faster computation, and improved model performance. This paper explores the benefits of reducing vector database dimensions, with a focus on computational efficiency and overcoming the curse of dimensionality. We introduce a novel application of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to dimensionality reduction, a method previously underexploited in this context. By demonstrating its utility across various AI domains, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and image processing, this FFT-based approach promises to improve data retrieval processes and enhance the efficiency and scalability of AI solutions. The incorporation of FFT may not only optimize operations in real-time processing and recommendation systems but also extend to advanced image processing techniques, where dimensionality reduction can significantly improve performance and analysis efficiency. This paper advocates for the broader adoption of FFT in vector database management, marking a significant stride towards addressing the challenges of data volume and complexity in AI research and applications. Unlike many existing approaches, we directly handle the embedding vectors produced by the model after processing a test input.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06278v1,2024-04
Understanding Cross-Lingual Alignment -- A Survey,"Katharina Hämmerl, Jindřich Libovický, Alexander Fraser","Cross-lingual alignment, the meaningful similarity of representations across languages in multilingual language models, has been an active field of research in recent years. We survey the literature of techniques to improve cross-lingual alignment, providing a taxonomy of methods and summarising insights from throughout the field. We present different understandings of cross-lingual alignment and their limitations. We provide a qualitative summary of results from a large number of surveyed papers. Finally, we discuss how these insights may be applied not only to encoder models, where this topic has been heavily studied, but also to encoder-decoder or even decoder-only models, and argue that an effective trade-off between language-neutral and language-specific information is key.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06228v2,2024-04
Low-Cost Generation and Evaluation of Dictionary Example Sentences,"Bill Cai, Clarence Boon Liang Ng, Daniel Tan, Shelvia Hotama","Dictionary example sentences play an important role in illustrating word definitions and usage, but manually creating quality sentences is challenging. Prior works have demonstrated that language models can be trained to generate example sentences. However, they relied on costly customized models and word sense datasets for generation and evaluation of their work. Rapid advancements in foundational models present the opportunity to create low-cost, zero-shot methods for the generation and evaluation of dictionary example sentences. We introduce a new automatic evaluation metric called OxfordEval that measures the win-rate of generated sentences against existing Oxford Dictionary sentences. OxfordEval shows high alignment with human judgments, enabling large-scale automated quality evaluation. We experiment with various LLMs and configurations to generate dictionary sentences across word classes. We complement this with a novel approach of using masked language models to identify and select sentences that best exemplify word meaning. The eventual model, FM-MLM, achieves over 85.1% win rate against Oxford baseline sentences according to OxfordEval, compared to 39.8% win rate for prior model-generated sentences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06224v1,2024-04
VI-OOD: A Unified Representation Learning Framework for Textual Out-of-distribution Detection,"Li-Ming Zhan, Bo Liu, Xiao-Ming Wu","Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and reliability of deep neural networks in various applications. While there has been a growing focus on OOD detection in visual data, the field of textual OOD detection has received less attention. Only a few attempts have been made to directly apply general OOD detection methods to natural language processing (NLP) tasks, without adequately considering the characteristics of textual data. In this paper, we delve into textual OOD detection with Transformers. We first identify a key problem prevalent in existing OOD detection methods: the biased representation learned through the maximization of the conditional likelihood $p(y\mid x)$ can potentially result in subpar performance. We then propose a novel variational inference framework for OOD detection (VI-OOD), which maximizes the likelihood of the joint distribution $p(x, y)$ instead of $p(y\mid x)$. VI-OOD is tailored for textual OOD detection by efficiently exploiting the representations of pre-trained Transformers. Through comprehensive experiments on various text classification tasks, VI-OOD demonstrates its effectiveness and wide applicability. Our code has been released at \url{https://github.com/liam0949/LLM-OOD}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06217v1,2024-04
[Call for Papers] The 2nd BabyLM Challenge: Sample-efficient pretraining on a developmentally plausible corpus,"Leshem Choshen, Ryan Cotterell, Michael Y. Hu, Tal Linzen, Aaron Mueller, Candace Ross, Alex Warstadt, Ethan Wilcox, Adina Williams, Chengxu Zhuang","After last year's successful BabyLM Challenge, the competition will be hosted again in 2024/2025. The overarching goals of the challenge remain the same; however, some of the competition rules will be different. The big changes for this year's competition are as follows: First, we replace the loose track with a paper track, which allows (for example) non-model-based submissions, novel cognitively-inspired benchmarks, or analysis techniques. Second, we are relaxing the rules around pretraining data, and will now allow participants to construct their own datasets provided they stay within the 100M-word or 10M-word budget. Third, we introduce a multimodal vision-and-language track, and will release a corpus of 50% text-only and 50% image-text multimodal data as a starting point for LM model training. The purpose of this CfP is to provide rules for this year's challenge, explain these rule changes and their rationale in greater detail, give a timeline of this year's competition, and provide answers to frequently asked questions from last year's challenge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06214v2,2024-04
Elephants Never Forget: Memorization and Learning of Tabular Data in Large Language Models,"Sebastian Bordt, Harsha Nori, Vanessa Rodrigues, Besmira Nushi, Rich Caruana","While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06209v3,2024-04
Clue-Instruct: Text-Based Clue Generation for Educational Crossword Puzzles,"Andrea Zugarini, Kamyar Zeinalipour, Surya Sai Kadali, Marco Maggini, Marco Gori, Leonardo Rigutini","Crossword puzzles are popular linguistic games often used as tools to engage students in learning. Educational crosswords are characterized by less cryptic and more factual clues that distinguish them from traditional crossword puzzles. Despite there exist several publicly available clue-answer pair databases for traditional crosswords, educational clue-answer pairs datasets are missing. In this article, we propose a methodology to build educational clue generation datasets that can be used to instruct Large Language Models (LLMs). By gathering from Wikipedia pages informative content associated with relevant keywords, we use Large Language Models to automatically generate pedagogical clues related to the given input keyword and its context. With such an approach, we created clue-instruct, a dataset containing 44,075 unique examples with text-keyword pairs associated with three distinct crossword clues. We used clue-instruct to instruct different LLMs to generate educational clues from a given input content and keyword. Both human and automatic evaluations confirmed the quality of the generated clues, thus validating the effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06186v1,2024-04
Characterizing Multimodal Long-form Summarization: A Case Study on Financial Reports,"Tianyu Cao, Natraj Raman, Danial Dervovic, Chenhao Tan","As large language models (LLMs) expand the power of natural language processing to handle long inputs, rigorous and systematic analyses are necessary to understand their abilities and behavior. A salient application is summarization, due to its ubiquity and controversy (e.g., researchers have declared the death of summarization). In this paper, we use financial report summarization as a case study because financial reports are not only long but also use numbers and tables extensively. We propose a computational framework for characterizing multimodal long-form summarization and investigate the behavior of Claude 2.0/2.1, GPT-4/3.5, and Cohere. We find that GPT-3.5 and Cohere fail to perform this summarization task meaningfully. For Claude 2 and GPT-4, we analyze the extractiveness of the summary and identify a position bias in LLMs. This position bias disappears after shuffling the input for Claude, which suggests that Claude seems to recognize important information. We also conduct a comprehensive investigation on the use of numeric data in LLM-generated summaries and offer a taxonomy of numeric hallucination. We employ prompt engineering to improve GPT-4's use of numbers with limited success. Overall, our analyses highlight the strong capability of Claude 2 in handling long multimodal inputs compared to GPT-4. The generated summaries and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/ChicagoHAI/characterizing-multimodal-long-form-summarization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06162v3,2024-04
(Not) Understanding Latin Poetic Style with Deep Learning,Ben Nagy,"This article summarizes some mostly unsuccessful attempts to understand authorial style by examining the attention of various neural networks (LSTMs and CNNs) trained on a corpus of classical Latin verse that has been encoded to include sonic and metrical features. Carefully configured neural networks are shown to be extremely strong authorship classifiers, so it is hoped that they might therefore teach `traditional' readers something about how the authors differ in style. Sadly their reasoning is, so far, inscrutable. While the overall goal has not yet been reached, this work reports some useful findings in terms of effective ways to encode and embed verse, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the neural network families, and useful (and not so useful) techniques for designing and inspecting NN models in this domain. This article suggests that, for poetry, CNNs are better choices than LSTMs -- they train more quickly, have equivalent accuracy, and (potentially) offer better interpretability. Based on a great deal of experimentation, it also suggests that simple, trainable embeddings are more effective than domain-specific schemes, and stresses the importance of techniques to reduce overfitting, like dropout and batch normalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06150v1,2024-04

However, a notable quality gap arises in low-resource languages, e.g., Indonesian indigenous languages, rendering them ineffective and inefficient in such linguistic contexts. To bridge this quality gap, we introduce Cendol, a collection of Indonesian LLMs encompassing both decoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures across a range of model sizes. We highlight Cendol's effectiveness across a diverse array of tasks, attaining 20% improvement, and demonstrate its capability to generalize to unseen tasks and indigenous languages of Indonesia. Furthermore, Cendol models showcase improved human favorability despite their limitations in capturing indigenous knowledge and cultural values in Indonesia. In addition, we discuss the shortcomings of parameter-efficient tunings, such as LoRA, for language adaptation. Alternatively, we propose the usage of vocabulary adaptation to enhance efficiency. Lastly, we evaluate the safety of Cendol and showcase that safety in pre-training in one language such as English is transferable to low-resource languages, such as Indonesian, even without RLHF and safety fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06138v2,2024-04

Our investigation spans a range of strategies to compare model predictions with reference standards, encompassing diverse baselines, the refinement of pre-trained encoders through supervised learning, and an ensemble approaches utilizing several high-performing models. Through these explorations, we introduce three distinct methods that exhibit strong performance metrics. To amplify our training data, we generate additional training samples from unlabelled training subset. Furthermore, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of our approaches.

Detection of fields of applications in biomedical abstracts with the support of argumentation elements,Mariana Neves,"Focusing on particular facts, instead of the complete text, can potentially improve searching for specific information in the scientific literature. In particular, argumentative elements allow focusing on specific parts of a publication, e.g., the background section or the claims from the authors. We evaluated some tools for the extraction of argumentation elements for a specific task in biomedicine, namely, for detecting the fields of the application in a biomedical publication, e.g, whether it addresses the problem of disease diagnosis or drug development. We performed experiments with the PubMedBERT pre-trained model, which was fine-tuned on a specific corpus for the task. We compared the use of title and abstract to restricting to only some argumentative elements. The top F1 scores ranged from 0.22 to 0.84, depending on the field of application. The best argumentative labels were the ones related the conclusion and background sections of an abstract.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06121v1,2024-04
"""Hey..! This medicine made me sick"": Sentiment Analysis of User-Generated Drug Reviews using Machine Learning Techniques","Abhiram B. Nair, Abhinand K., Anamika U., Denil Tom Jaison, Ajitha V., V. S. Anoop","Sentiment analysis has become increasingly important in healthcare, especially in the biomedical and pharmaceutical fields. The data generated by the general public on the effectiveness, side effects, and adverse drug reactions are goldmines for different agencies and medicine producers to understand the concerns and reactions of people. Despite the challenge of obtaining datasets on drug-related problems, sentiment analysis on this topic would be a significant boon to the field. This project proposes a drug review classification system that classifies user reviews on a particular drug into different classes, such as positive, negative, and neutral. This approach uses a dataset that is collected from publicly available sources containing drug reviews, such as drugs.com. The collected data is manually labeled and verified manually to ensure that the labels are correct. Three pre-trained language models, such as BERT, SciBERT, and BioBERT, are used to obtain embeddings, which were later used as features to different machine learning classifiers such as decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, and also deep learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks. The performance of these classifiers is quantified using precision, recall, and f1-score, and the results show that the proposed approaches are useful in analyzing the sentiments of people on different drugs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13057v1,2024-04
Exploring the Necessity of Visual Modality in Multimodal Machine Translation using Authentic Datasets,"Zi Long, Zhenhao Tang, Xianghua Fu, Jian Chen, Shilong Hou, Jinze Lyu","Recent research in the field of multimodal machine translation (MMT) has indicated that the visual modality is either dispensable or offers only marginal advantages. However, most of these conclusions are drawn from the analysis of experimental results based on a limited set of bilingual sentence-image pairs, such as Multi30k. In these kinds of datasets, the content of one bilingual parallel sentence pair must be well represented by a manually annotated image, which is different from the real-world translation scenario. In this work, we adhere to the universal multimodal machine translation framework proposed by Tang et al. (2022). This approach allows us to delve into the impact of the visual modality on translation efficacy by leveraging real-world translation datasets. Through a comprehensive exploration via probing tasks, we find that the visual modality proves advantageous for the majority of authentic translation datasets. Notably, the translation performance primarily hinges on the alignment and coherence between textual and visual contents. Furthermore, our results suggest that visual information serves a supplementary role in multimodal translation and can be substituted.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06107v1,2024-04
Making Old Kurdish Publications Processable by Augmenting Available Optical Character Recognition Engines,"Blnd Yaseen, Hossein Hassani","Kurdish libraries have many historical publications that were printed back in the early days when printing devices were brought to Kurdistan. Having a good Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to help process these publications and contribute to the Kurdish languages resources which is crucial as Kurdish is considered a low-resource language. Current OCR systems are unable to extract text from historical documents as they have many issues, including being damaged, very fragile, having many marks left on them, and often written in non-standard fonts and more. This is a massive obstacle in processing these documents as currently processing them requires manual typing which is very time-consuming. In this study, we adopt an open-source OCR framework by Google, Tesseract version 5.0, that has been used to extract text for various languages. Currently, there is no public dataset, and we developed our own by collecting historical documents from Zheen Center for Documentation and Research, which were printed before 1950 and resulted in a dataset of 1233 images of lines with transcription of each. Then we used the Arabic model as our base model and trained the model using the dataset. We used different methods to evaluate our model, Tesseracts built-in evaluator lstmeval indicated a Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.755%. Additionally, Ocreval demonstrated an average character accuracy of 84.02%. Finally, we developed a web application to provide an easy- to-use interface for end-users, allowing them to interact with the model by inputting an image of a page and extracting the text. Having an extensive dataset is crucial to develop OCR systems with reasonable accuracy, as currently, no public datasets are available for historical Kurdish documents; this posed a significant challenge in our work. Additionally, the unaligned spaces between characters and words proved another challenge with our work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06101v1,2024-04

Heuristic-enhanced Candidates Selection strategy for GPTs tackle Few-Shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Baoxing Jiang, Yujie Wan, Shenggen Ju","Few-Shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (FSABSA) is an indispensable and highly challenging task in natural language processing. However, methods based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) struggle to accommodate multiple sub-tasks, and methods based on Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) perform poorly. To address the above issues, the paper designs a Heuristic-enhanced Candidates Selection (HCS) strategy and further proposes All in One (AiO) model based on it. The model works in a two-stage, which simultaneously accommodates the accuracy of PLMs and the generalization capability of GPTs. Specifically, in the first stage, a backbone model based on PLMs generates rough heuristic candidates for the input sentence. In the second stage, AiO leverages LLMs' contextual learning capabilities to generate precise predictions. The study conducted comprehensive comparative and ablation experiments on five benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can better adapt to multiple sub-tasks, and also outperforms the methods that directly utilize GPTs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06063v2,2024-04
Identifying Shopping Intent in Product QA for Proactive Recommendations,"Besnik Fetahu, Nachshon Cohen, Elad Haramaty, Liane Lewin-Eytan, Oleg Rokhlenko, Shervin Malmasi","Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart devices allowing users to instantly access information via voice questions. While extensive research has been conducted in question answering for voice search, little attention has been paid on how to enable proactive recommendations from a voice assistant to its users. This is a highly challenging problem that often leads to user friction, mainly due to recommendations provided to the users at the wrong time. We focus on the domain of e-commerce, namely in identifying Shopping Product Questions (SPQs), where the user asking a product-related question may have an underlying shopping need. Identifying a user's shopping need allows voice assistants to enhance shopping experience by determining when to provide recommendations, such as product or deal recommendations, or proactive shopping actions recommendation. Identifying SPQs is a challenging problem and cannot be done from question text alone, and thus requires to infer latent user behavior patterns inferred from user's past shopping history. We propose features that capture the user's latent shopping behavior from their purchase history, and combine them using a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach is able to identify SPQs with a high score of F1=0.91. Furthermore, based on an online evaluation with real voice assistant users, we identify SPQs in real-time and recommend shopping actions to users to add the queried product into their shopping list. We demonstrate that we are able to accurately identify SPQs, as indicated by the significantly higher rate of added products to users' shopping lists when being prompted after SPQs vs random PQs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06017v1,2024-04
Extractive text summarisation of Privacy Policy documents using machine learning approaches,Chanwoo Choi,"This work demonstrates two Privacy Policy (PP) summarisation models based on two different clustering algorithms: K-means clustering and Pre-determined Centroid (PDC) clustering. K-means is decided to be used for the first model after an extensive evaluation of ten commonly used clustering algorithms. The summariser model based on the PDC-clustering algorithm summarises PP documents by segregating individual sentences by Euclidean distance from each sentence to the pre-defined cluster centres. The cluster centres are defined according to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)'s 14 essential topics that must be included in any privacy notices. The PDC model outperformed the K-means model for two evaluation methods, Sum of Squared Distance (SSD) and ROUGE by some margin (27% and 24% respectively). This result contrasts the K-means model's better performance in the general clustering of sentence vectors before running the task-specific evaluation. This indicates the effectiveness of operating task-specific fine-tuning measures on unsupervised machine-learning models. The summarisation mechanisms implemented in this paper demonstrates an idea of how to efficiently extract essential sentences that should be included in any PP documents. The summariser models could be further developed to an application that tests the GDPR-compliance (or any data privacy legislation) of PP documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08686v1,2024-04
AiSAQ: All-in-Storage ANNS with Product Quantization for DRAM-free Information Retrieval,"Kento Tatsuno, Daisuke Miyashita, Taiga Ikeda, Kiyoshi Ishiyama, Kazunari Sumiyoshi, Jun Deguchi","In approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) methods based on approximate proximity graphs, DiskANN achieves good recall-speed balance for large-scale datasets using both of RAM and storage. Despite it claims to save memory usage by loading compressed vectors by product quantization (PQ), its memory usage increases in proportion to the scale of datasets. In this paper, we propose All-in-Storage ANNS with Product Quantization (AiSAQ), which offloads the compressed vectors to storage. Our method achieves $\sim$10 MB memory usage in query search even with billion-scale datasets with minor performance degradation. AiSAQ also reduces the index load time before query search, which enables the index switch between muitiple billion-scale datasets and significantly enhances the flexibility of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

FreeEval: A Modular Framework for Trustworthy and Efficient Evaluation of Large Language Models,"Zhuohao Yu, Chang Gao, Wenjin Yao, Yidong Wang, Zhengran Zeng, Wei Ye, Jindong Wang, Yue Zhang, Shikun Zhang","The rapid development of large language model (LLM) evaluation methodologies and datasets has led to a profound challenge: integrating state-of-the-art evaluation techniques cost-effectively while ensuring reliability, reproducibility, and efficiency. Currently, there is a notable absence of a unified and adaptable framework that seamlessly integrates various evaluation approaches. Moreover, the reliability of evaluation findings is often questionable due to potential data contamination, with the evaluation efficiency commonly overlooked when facing the substantial costs associated with LLM inference. In response to these challenges, we introduce FreeEval, a modular and scalable framework crafted to enable trustworthy and efficient automatic evaluations of LLMs. Firstly, FreeEval's unified abstractions simplify the integration and improve the transparency of diverse evaluation methodologies, encompassing dynamic evaluation that demand sophisticated LLM interactions. Secondly, the framework integrates meta-evaluation techniques like human evaluation and data contamination detection, which, along with dynamic evaluation modules in the platform, enhance the fairness of the evaluation outcomes.

Privacy Preserving Prompt Engineering: A Survey,"Kennedy Edemacu, Xintao Wu","Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated significant proficiency in solving a wide range of general natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Researchers have observed a direct correlation between the performance of these models and their sizes. As a result, the sizes of these models have notably expanded in recent years, persuading researchers to adopt the term large language models (LLMs) to characterize the larger-sized PLMs. The size expansion comes with a distinct capability called in-context learning (ICL), which represents a special form of prompting and allows the models to be utilized through the presentation of demonstration examples without modifications to the model parameters. Although interesting, privacy concerns have become a major obstacle in its widespread usage. Multiple studies have examined the privacy risks linked to ICL and prompting in general, and have devised techniques to alleviate these risks. Thus, there is a necessity to organize these mitigation techniques for the benefit of the community. This survey provides a systematic overview of the privacy protection methods employed during ICL and prompting in general. We review, analyze, and compare different methods under this paradigm. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the resources accessible for the development of these frameworks. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these frameworks and offer a detailed examination of the promising areas that necessitate further exploration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06001v2,2024-04
AEGIS: Online Adaptive AI Content Safety Moderation with Ensemble of LLM Experts,"Shaona Ghosh, Prasoon Varshney, Erick Galinkin, Christopher Parisien","As Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI become more widespread, the content safety risks associated with their use also increase. We find a notable deficiency in high-quality content safety datasets and benchmarks that comprehensively cover a wide range of critical safety areas. To address this, we define a broad content safety risk taxonomy, comprising 13 critical risk and 9 sparse risk categories. Additionally, we curate AEGISSAFETYDATASET, a new dataset of approximately 26, 000 human-LLM interaction instances, complete with human annotations adhering to the taxonomy. We plan to release this dataset to the community to further research and to help benchmark LLM models for safety. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we instruction-tune multiple LLM-based safety models. We show that our models (named AEGISSAFETYEXPERTS), not only surpass or perform competitively with the state-of-the-art LLM-based safety models and general purpose LLMs, but also exhibit robustness across multiple jail-break attack categories. We also show how using AEGISSAFETYDATASET during the LLM alignment phase does not negatively impact the performance of the aligned models on MT Bench scores. Furthermore, we propose AEGIS, a novel application of a no-regret online adaptation framework with strong theoretical guarantees, to perform content moderation with an ensemble of LLM content safety experts in deployment",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05993v2,2024-04
Event-enhanced Retrieval in Real-time Search,"Yanan Zhang, Xiaoling Bai, Tianhua Zhou","The embedding-based retrieval (EBR) approach is widely used in mainstream search engine retrieval systems and is crucial in recent retrieval-augmented methods for eliminating LLM illusions. However, existing EBR models often face the ""semantic drift"" problem and insufficient focus on key information, leading to a low adoption rate of retrieval results in subsequent steps. This issue is especially noticeable in real-time search scenarios, where the various expressions of popular events on the Internet make real-time retrieval heavily reliant on crucial event information. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach called EER, which enhances real-time retrieval performance by improving the dual-encoder model of traditional EBR. We incorporate contrastive learning to accompany pairwise learning for encoder optimization. Furthermore, to strengthen the focus on critical event information in events, we include a decoder module after the document encoder, introduce a generative event triplet extraction scheme based on prompt-tuning, and correlate the events with query encoder optimization through comparative learning. This decoder module can be removed during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EER can significantly improve the real-time search retrieval performance. We believe that this approach will provide new perspectives in the field of information retrieval.

Does Transformer Interpretability Transfer to RNNs?,"Gonçalo Paulo, Thomas Marshall, Nora Belrose","Recent advances in recurrent neural network architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have enabled RNNs to match or exceed the performance of equal-size transformers in terms of language modeling perplexity and downstream evaluations, suggesting that future systems may be built on completely new architectures. In this paper, we examine if selected interpretability methods originally designed for transformer language models will transfer to these up-and-coming recurrent architectures. Specifically, we focus on steering model outputs via contrastive activation addition, on eliciting latent predictions via the tuned lens, and eliciting latent knowledge from models fine-tuned to produce false outputs under certain conditions. Our results show that most of these techniques are effective when applied to RNNs, and we show that it is possible to improve some of them by taking advantage of RNNs' compressed state.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05971v1,2024-04
Optimization Methods for Personalizing Large Language Models through Retrieval Augmentation,"Alireza Salemi, Surya Kallumadi, Hamed Zamani","This paper studies retrieval-augmented approaches for personalizing large language models (LLMs), which potentially have a substantial impact on various applications and domains. We propose the first attempt to optimize the retrieval models that deliver a limited number of personal documents to large language models for the purpose of personalized generation. We develop two optimization algorithms that solicit feedback from the downstream personalized generation tasks for retrieval optimization -- one based on reinforcement learning whose reward function is defined using any arbitrary metric for personalized generation and another based on knowledge distillation from the downstream LLM to the retrieval model. This paper also introduces a pre- and post-generation retriever selection model that decides what retriever to choose for each LLM input. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks from the language model personalization (LaMP) benchmark reveal statistically significant improvements in six out of seven datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05970v1,2024-04
JSTR: Judgment Improves Scene Text Recognition,Masato Fujitake,"In this paper, we present a method for enhancing the accuracy of scene text recognition tasks by judging whether the image and text match each other. While previous studies focused on generating the recognition results from input images, our approach also considers the model's misrecognition results to understand its error tendencies, thus improving the text recognition pipeline. This method boosts text recognition accuracy by providing explicit feedback on the data that the model is likely to misrecognize by predicting correct or incorrect between the image and text. The experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline and state-of-the-art methods in scene text recognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05967v1,2024-04
THOUGHTSCULPT: Reasoning with Intermediate Revision and Search,"Yizhou Chi, Kevin Yang, Dan Klein","We present THOUGHTSCULPT, a general reasoning and search method for tasks with outputs that can be decomposed into components. THOUGHTSCULPT explores a search tree of potential solutions using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), building solutions one action at a time and evaluating according to any domain-specific heuristic, which in practice is often simply an LLM evaluator. Critically, our action space includes revision actions: THOUGHTSCULPT may choose to revise part of its previous output rather than continuing to build the rest of its output. Empirically, THOUGHTSCULPT outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning methods across three challenging tasks: Story Outline Improvement (up to +30% interestingness), Mini-Crosswords Solving (up to +16% word success rate), and Constrained Generation (up to +10% concept coverage).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05966v1,2024-04
LLM2Vec: Large Language Models Are Secretly Powerful Text Encoders,"Parishad BehnamGhader, Vaibhav Adlakha, Marius Mosbach, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Nicolas Chapados, Siva Reddy","Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models on most of today's NLP tasks and benchmarks. Yet, the community is only slowly adopting these models for text embedding tasks, which require rich contextualized representations. In this work, we introduce LLM2Vec, a simple unsupervised approach that can transform any decoder-only LLM into a strong text encoder. LLM2Vec consists of three simple steps: 1) enabling bidirectional attention, 2) masked next token prediction, and 3) unsupervised contrastive learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM2Vec by applying it to 4 popular LLMs ranging from 1.3B to 8B parameters and evaluate the transformed models on English word- and sequence-level tasks. We outperform encoder-only models by a large margin on word-level tasks and reach a new unsupervised state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB). Moreover, when combining LLM2Vec with supervised contrastive learning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB among models that train only on publicly available data (as of May 24, 2024). Our strong empirical results and extensive analysis demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively transformed into universal text encoders in a parameter-efficient manner without the need for expensive adaptation or synthetic GPT-4 generated data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05961v2,2024-04
VisualWebBench: How Far Have Multimodal LLMs Evolved in Web Page Understanding and Grounding?,"Junpeng Liu, Yifan Song, Bill Yuchen Lin, Wai Lam, Graham Neubig, Yuanzhi Li, Xiang Yue","Multimodal Large Language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in web-related tasks, but evaluating their performance in the web domain remains a challenge due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. Existing benchmarks are either designed for general multimodal tasks, failing to capture the unique characteristics of web pages, or focus on end-to-end web agent tasks, unable to measure fine-grained abilities such as OCR, understanding, and grounding. In this paper, we introduce \bench{}, a multimodal benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs across a variety of web tasks. \bench{} consists of seven tasks, and comprises 1.5K human-curated instances from 139 real websites, covering 87 sub-domains. We evaluate 14 open-source MLLMs, Gemini Pro, Claude-3 series, and GPT-4V(ision) on \bench{}, revealing significant challenges and performance gaps. Further analysis highlights the limitations of current MLLMs, including inadequate grounding in text-rich environments and subpar performance with low-resolution image inputs. We believe \bench{} will serve as a valuable resource for the research community and contribute to the creation of more powerful and versatile MLLMs for web-related applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05955v1,2024-04
"Interplay of Machine Translation, Diacritics, and Diacritization","Wei-Rui Chen, Ife Adebara, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed","We investigate two research questions: (1) how do machine translation (MT) and diacritization influence the performance of each other in a multi-task learning setting (2) the effect of keeping (vs. removing) diacritics on MT performance. We examine these two questions in both high-resource (HR) and low-resource (LR) settings across 55 different languages (36 African languages and 19 European languages). For (1), results show that diacritization significantly benefits MT in the LR scenario, doubling or even tripling performance for some languages, but harms MT in the HR scenario. We find that MT harms diacritization in LR but benefits significantly in HR for some languages. For (2), MT performance is similar regardless of diacritics being kept or removed. In addition, we propose two classes of metrics to measure the complexity of a diacritical system, finding these metrics to correlate positively with the performance of our diacritization models. Overall, our work provides insights for developing MT and diacritization systems under different data size conditions and may have implications that generalize beyond the 55 languages we investigate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05943v1,2024-04

This paper introduces the Hallucinations Leaderboard, an open initiative to quantitatively measure and compare the tendency of each model to produce hallucinations. The leaderboard uses a comprehensive set of benchmarks focusing on different aspects of hallucinations, such as factuality and faithfulness, across various tasks, including question-answering, summarisation, and reading comprehension.

WILBUR: Adaptive In-Context Learning for Robust and Accurate Web Agents,"Michael Lutz, Arth Bohra, Manvel Saroyan, Artem Harutyunyan, Giovanni Campagna","In the realm of web agent research, achieving both generalization and accuracy remains a challenging problem. Due to high variance in website structure, existing approaches often fail. Moreover, existing fine-tuning and in-context learning techniques fail to generalize across multiple websites. We introduce Wilbur, an approach that uses a differentiable ranking model and a novel instruction synthesis technique to optimally populate a black-box large language model's prompt with task demonstrations from previous runs. To maximize end-to-end success rates, we also propose an intelligent backtracking mechanism that learns and recovers from its mistakes. Finally, we show that our ranking model can be trained on data from a generative auto-curriculum which samples representative goals from an LLM, runs the agent, and automatically evaluates it, with no manual annotation. Wilbur achieves state-of-the-art results on the WebVoyager benchmark, beating text-only models by 8% overall, and up to 36% on certain websites. On the same benchmark, Wilbur is within 5% of a strong multi-modal model despite only receiving textual inputs, and further analysis reveals a substantial number of failures are due to engineering challenges of operating the web.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05902v1,2024-04
Use of a Structured Knowledge Base Enhances Metadata Curation by Large Language Models,"Sowmya S. Sundaram, Benjamin Solomon, Avani Khatri, Anisha Laumas, Purvesh Khatri, Mark A. Musen","Metadata play a crucial role in ensuring the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of datasets. This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to improve adherence to metadata standards. We conducted experiments on 200 random data records describing human samples relating to lung cancer from the NCBI BioSample repository, evaluating GPT-4's ability to suggest edits for adherence to metadata standards. We computed the adherence accuracy of field name-field value pairs through a peer review process, and we observed a marginal average improvement in adherence to the standard data dictionary from 79% to 80% (p<0.5). We then prompted GPT-4 with domain information in the form of the textual descriptions of CEDAR templates and recorded a significant improvement to 97% from 79% (p<0.01). These results indicate that, while LLMs may not be able to correct legacy metadata to ensure satisfactory adherence to standards when unaided, they do show promise for use in automated metadata curation when integrated with a structured knowledge base",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05893v4,2024-04

Eraser: Jailbreaking Defense in Large Language Models via Unlearning Harmful Knowledge,"Weikai Lu, Ziqian Zeng, Jianwei Wang, Zhengdong Lu, Zelin Chen, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen","Jailbreaking attacks can enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to bypass the safeguard and generate harmful content. Existing jailbreaking defense methods have failed to address the fundamental issue that harmful knowledge resides within the model, leading to potential jailbreak risks for LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel defense method called Eraser, which mainly includes three goals: unlearning harmful knowledge, retaining general knowledge, and maintaining safety alignment. The intuition is that if an LLM forgets the specific knowledge required to answer a harmful question, it will no longer have the ability to answer harmful questions. The training of Erase does not actually require the model's own harmful knowledge, and it can benefit from unlearning general answers related to harmful queries, which means it does not need assistance from the red team. The experimental results show that Eraser can significantly reduce the jailbreaking success rate for various attacks without compromising the general capabilities of the model.

CodecLM: Aligning Language Models with Tailored Synthetic Data,"Zifeng Wang, Chun-Liang Li, Vincent Perot, Long T. Le, Jin Miao, Zizhao Zhang, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister","Instruction tuning has emerged as the key in aligning large language models (LLMs) with specific task instructions, thereby mitigating the discrepancy between the next-token prediction objective and users' actual goals. To reduce the labor and time cost to collect or annotate data by humans, researchers start to explore the use of LLMs to generate instruction-aligned synthetic data. Recent works focus on generating diverse instructions and applying LLM to increase instruction complexity, often neglecting downstream use cases. It remains unclear how to tailor high-quality data to elicit better instruction-following abilities in different target instruction distributions and LLMs. To this end, we introduce CodecLM, a general framework for adaptively generating high-quality synthetic data for LLM alignment with different downstream instruction distributions and LLMs. Drawing on the Encode-Decode principles, we use LLMs as codecs to guide the data generation process. We first encode seed instructions into metadata, which are concise keywords generated on-the-fly to capture the target instruction distribution, and then decode metadata to create tailored instructions. We also introduce Self-Rubrics and Contrastive Filtering during decoding to tailor data-efficient samples. Extensive experiments on four open-domain instruction following benchmarks validate the effectiveness of CodecLM over the current state-of-the-arts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05875v1,2024-04
Negative Preference Optimization: From Catastrophic Collapse to Effective Unlearning,"Ruiqi Zhang, Licong Lin, Yu Bai, Song Mei","Large Language Models (LLMs) often memorize sensitive, private, or copyrighted data during pre-training. LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data from the pre-trained model while preserving the model's utilities on other tasks. Several practical methods have recently been proposed for LLM unlearning, mostly based on gradient ascent (GA) on the loss of undesirable data. However, on certain unlearning tasks, these methods either fail to effectively unlearn the target data or suffer from catastrophic collapse -- a drastic degradation of the model's utilities.   In this paper, we propose Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), a simple alignment-inspired method that could efficiently and effectively unlearn a target dataset. We theoretically show that the progression toward catastrophic collapse by minimizing the NPO loss is exponentially slower than GA. Through experiments on synthetic data and the benchmark TOFU dataset, we demonstrate that NPO-based methods achieve a better balance between unlearning the undesirable data and maintaining the model's utilities. We also observe that NPO-based methods generate more sensible outputs than GA-based methods, whose outputs are often gibberish. Remarkably, on TOFU, NPO-based methods are the first to achieve reasonable unlearning results in forgetting 50% (or more) of the training data, whereas existing methods already struggle with forgetting 10% of training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05868v2,2024-04
GeniL: A Multilingual Dataset on Generalizing Language,"Aida Mostafazadeh Davani, Sagar Gubbi, Sunipa Dev, Shachi Dave, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran","Generative language models are transforming our digital ecosystem, but they often inherit societal biases, for instance stereotypes associating certain attributes with specific identity groups. While whether and how these biases are mitigated may depend on the specific use cases, being able to effectively detect instances of stereotype perpetuation is a crucial first step. Current methods to assess presence of stereotypes in generated language rely on simple template or co-occurrence based measures, without accounting for the variety of sentential contexts they manifest in. We argue that understanding the sentential context is crucial for detecting instances of generalization. We distinguish two types of generalizations: (1) language that merely mentions the presence of a generalization (""people think the French are very rude""), and (2) language that reinforces such a generalization (""as French they must be rude""), from non-generalizing context (""My French friends think I am rude""). For meaningful stereotype evaluations, we need to reliably distinguish such instances of generalizations. We introduce the new task of detecting generalization in language, and build GeniL, a multilingual dataset of over 50K sentences from 9 languages (English, Arabic, Bengali, Spanish, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Malay, and Portuguese) annotated for instances of generalizations. We demonstrate that the likelihood of a co-occurrence being an instance of generalization is usually low, and varies across different languages, identity groups, and attributes. We build classifiers to detect generalization in language with an overall PR-AUC of 58.7, with varying degrees of performance across languages. Our research provides data and tools to enable a nuanced understanding of stereotype perpetuation, a crucial step towards more inclusive and responsible language technologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05866v2,2024-04
Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token,Franz A. Heinsen,"We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05843v2,2024-04

Neural Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling with Attention by Leveraging Deep Learning Architectures for Enhanced Contextual Understanding in Abstractive Text Summarization,"Bhavith Chandra Challagundla, Chakradhar Peddavenkatagari","Automatic text summarization (TS) plays a pivotal role in condensing large volumes of information into concise, coherent summaries, facilitating efficient information retrieval and comprehension. This paper presents a novel framework for abstractive TS of single documents, which integrates three dominant aspects: structural, semantic, and neural-based approaches. The proposed framework merges machine learning and knowledge-based techniques to achieve a unified methodology. The framework consists of three main phases: pre-processing, machine learning, and post-processing. In the pre-processing phase, a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) technique is employed to generalize ambiguous words, enhancing content generalization. Semantic content generalization is then performed to address out-of-vocabulary (OOV) or rare words, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the input document. Subsequently, the generalized text is transformed into a continuous vector space using neural language processing techniques. A deep sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with an attention mechanism is employed to predict a generalized summary based on the vector representation. In the post-processing phase, heuristic algorithms and text similarity metrics are utilized to refine the generated summary further. Concepts from the generalized summary are matched with specific entities, enhancing coherence and readability. Experimental evaluations conducted on prominent datasets, including Gigaword, Duc 2004, and CNN/DailyMail, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Results indicate significant improvements in handling rare and OOV words, outperforming existing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The proposed framework presents a comprehensive and unified approach towards abstractive TS, combining the strengths of structure, semantics, and neural-based methodologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08685v1,2024-04
Language-Independent Representations Improve Zero-Shot Summarization,"Vladimir Solovyev, Danni Liu, Jan Niehues","Finetuning pretrained models on downstream generation tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting in zero-shot conditions. In this work, we focus on summarization and tackle the problem through the lens of language-independent representations. After training on monolingual summarization, we perform zero-shot transfer to new languages or language pairs. We first show naively finetuned models are highly language-specific in both output behavior and internal representations, resulting in poor zero-shot performance. Next, we propose query-key (QK) finetuning to decouple task-specific knowledge from the pretrained language generation abilities. Then, after showing downsides of the standard adversarial language classifier, we propose a balanced variant that more directly enforces language-agnostic representations. Moreover, our qualitative analyses show removing source language identity correlates to zero-shot summarization performance. Our code is openly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05720v1,2024-04
Ferret-UI: Grounded Mobile UI Understanding with Multimodal LLMs,"Keen You, Haotian Zhang, Eldon Schoop, Floris Weers, Amanda Swearngin, Jeffrey Nichols, Yinfei Yang, Zhe Gan","Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate ""any resolution"" on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features. Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio (i.e., horizontal division for portrait screens and vertical division for landscape screens). Both sub-images are encoded separately before being sent to LLMs. We meticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing. These samples are formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise referring and grounding. To augment the model's reasoning ability, we further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description, perception/interaction conversations, and function inference. After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions. For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all the aforementioned tasks. Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05719v1,2024-04
A Survey on Responsible Generative AI: What to Generate and What Not,Jindong Gu,"In recent years, generative AI (GenAI), like large language models and text-to-image models, has received significant attention across various domains.

To answer the question, this paper investigates the practical responsible requirements of both textual and visual generative models, outlining five key considerations: generating truthful content, avoiding toxic content, refusing harmful instruction, leaking no training data-related content, and ensuring generated content identifiable. Specifically, we review recent advancements and challenges in addressing these requirements.

Friedrich","Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) can be largely attributed to the advent of pre-trained language models such as BERT and RoBERTa. While these models demonstrate remarkable performance on general datasets, they can struggle in specialized domains such as medicine, where unique domain-specific terminologies, domain-specific abbreviations, and varying document structures are common. This paper explores strategies for adapting these models to domain-specific requirements, primarily through continuous pre-training on domain-specific data. We pre-trained several German medical language models on 2.4B tokens derived from translated public English medical data and 3B tokens of German clinical data. The resulting models were evaluated on various German downstream tasks, including named entity recognition (NER), multi-label classification, and extractive question answering. Our results suggest that models augmented by clinical and translation-based pre-training typically outperform general domain models in medical contexts. We conclude that continuous pre-training has demonstrated the ability to match or even exceed the performance of clinical models trained from scratch. Furthermore, pre-training on clinical data or leveraging translated texts have proven to be reliable methods for domain adaptation in medical NLP tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05694v2,2024-04
Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning Beyond Accuracy,"Shijie Xia, Xuefeng Li, Yixin Liu, Tongshuang Wu, Pengfei Liu","The leaderboard of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical tasks has been continuously updated. However, the majority of evaluations focus solely on the final results, neglecting the quality of the intermediate steps. This oversight can mask underlying problems, such as logical errors or unnecessary steps in the reasoning process. To measure reasoning beyond final-answer accuracy, we introduce ReasonEval, a new methodology for evaluating the quality of reasoning steps. ReasonEval employs $\textit{validity}$ and $\textit{redundancy}$ to characterize the reasoning quality, as well as accompanying LLMs to assess them automatically. Instantiated by base models that possess strong mathematical knowledge and trained with high-quality labeled data, ReasonEval achieves state-of-the-art performance on human-labeled datasets and can accurately detect different types of errors generated by perturbation. When applied to evaluate LLMs specialized in math, we find that an increase in final-answer accuracy does not necessarily guarantee an improvement in the overall quality of the reasoning steps for challenging mathematical problems. Additionally, we observe that ReasonEval can play a significant role in data selection. We release the best-performing model, meta-evaluation script, and all evaluation results at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ReasonEval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05692v1,2024-04

The analysis is grounded in the identification of patterns, contradictions, and unique response elements across different input formats. Results: Findings reveal that pseudo-code engineering inputs significantly enhance the clarity and determinism of ChatGPT's responses, reducing ambiguity inherent in natural language. Enhanced natural language, structured through prompt engineering techniques, similarly improves the model's interpretability and creativity. Conclusions: The study underscores the potential of pseudo-code engineering in refining human-AI interaction and achieving more deterministic, concise, and direct outcomes, advocating for its broader application across disciplines requiring precise AI responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08684v1,2024-04
Text clustering applied to data augmentation in legal contexts,"Lucas José Gonçalves Freitas, Thaís Rodrigues, Guilherme Rodrigues, Pamella Edokawa, Ariane Farias","Data analysis and machine learning are of preeminent importance in the legal domain, especially in tasks like clustering and text classification. In this study, we harnessed the power of natural language processing tools to enhance datasets meticulously curated by experts. This process significantly improved the classification workflow for legal texts using machine learning techniques. We considered the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) data from the United Nations 2030 Agenda as a practical case study. Data augmentation clustering-based strategy led to remarkable enhancements in the accuracy and sensitivity metrics of classification models. For certain SDGs within the 2030 Agenda, we observed performance gains of over 15%. In some cases, the example base expanded by a noteworthy factor of 5. When dealing with unclassified legal texts, data augmentation strategies centered around clustering prove to be highly effective. They provide a valuable means to expand the existing knowledge base without the need for labor-intensive manual classification efforts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08683v1,2024-04
Fighting crime with Transformers: Empirical analysis of address parsing methods in payment data,"Haitham Hammami, Louis Baligand, Bojan Petrovski","In the financial industry, identifying the location of parties involved in payments is a major challenge in the context of various regulatory requirements. For this purpose address parsing entails extracting fields such as street, postal code, or country from free text message attributes. While payment processing platforms are updating their standards with more structured formats such as SWIFT with ISO 20022, address parsing remains essential for a considerable volume of messages. With the emergence of Transformers and Generative Large Language Models (LLM), we explore the performance of state-of-the-art solutions given the constraint of processing a vast amount of daily data. This paper also aims to show the need for training robust models capable of dealing with real-world noisy transactional data. Our results suggest that a well fine-tuned Transformer model using early-stopping significantly outperforms other approaches. Nevertheless, generative LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance and warrant further investigations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05632v2,2024-04
LTNER: Large Language Model Tagging for Named Entity Recognition with Contextualized Entity Marking,"Faren Yan, Peng Yu, Xin Chen","The use of LLMs for natural language processing has become a popular trend in the past two years, driven by their formidable capacity for context comprehension and learning, which has inspired a wave of research from academics and industry professionals. However, for certain NLP tasks, such as NER, the performance of LLMs still falls short when compared to supervised learning methods. In our research, we developed a NER processing framework called LTNER that incorporates a revolutionary Contextualized Entity Marking Gen Method. By leveraging the cost-effective GPT-3.5 coupled with context learning that does not require additional training, we significantly improved the accuracy of LLMs in handling NER tasks. The F1 score on the CoNLL03 dataset increased from the initial 85.9% to 91.9%, approaching the performance of supervised fine-tuning. This outcome has led to a deeper understanding of the potential of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05624v1,2024-04
AnchorAL: Computationally Efficient Active Learning for Large and Imbalanced Datasets,"Pietro Lesci, Andreas Vlachos","Active learning for imbalanced classification tasks is challenging as the minority classes naturally occur rarely. Gathering a large pool of unlabelled data is thus essential to capture minority instances. Standard pool-based active learning is computationally expensive on large pools and often reaches low accuracy by overfitting the initial decision boundary, thus failing to explore the input space and find minority instances. To address these issues we propose AnchorAL. At each iteration, AnchorAL chooses class-specific instances from the labelled set, or anchors, and retrieves the most similar unlabelled instances from the pool. This resulting subpool is then used for active learning. Using a small, fixed-sized subpool AnchorAL allows scaling any active learning strategy to large pools. By dynamically selecting different anchors at each iteration it promotes class balance and prevents overfitting the initial decision boundary, thus promoting the discovery of new clusters of minority instances. In experiments across different classification tasks, active learning strategies, and model architectures AnchorAL is (i) faster, often reducing runtime from hours to minutes, (ii) trains more performant models, (iii) and returns more balanced datasets than competing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05623v2,2024-04
How to Evaluate Entity Resolution Systems: An Entity-Centric Framework with Application to Inventor Name Disambiguation,"Olivier Binette, Youngsoo Baek, Siddharth Engineer, Christina Jones, Abel Dasylva, Jerome P. Reiter","Entity resolution (record linkage, microclustering) systems are notoriously difficult to evaluate. Looking for a needle in a haystack, traditional evaluation methods use sophisticated, application-specific sampling schemes to find matching pairs of records among an immense number of non-matches. We propose an alternative that facilitates the creation of representative, reusable benchmark data sets without necessitating complex sampling schemes. These benchmark data sets can then be used for model training and a variety of evaluation tasks. Specifically, we propose an entity-centric data labeling methodology that integrates with a unified framework for monitoring summary statistics, estimating key performance metrics such as cluster and pairwise precision and recall, and analyzing root causes for errors. We validate the framework in an application to inventor name disambiguation and through simulation studies.

SpeechAlign: Aligning Speech Generation to Human Preferences,"Dong Zhang, Zhaowei Li, Shimin Li, Xin Zhang, Pengyu Wang, Yaqian Zhou, Xipeng Qiu","Speech language models have significantly advanced in generating realistic speech, with neural codec language models standing out. However, the integration of human feedback to align speech outputs to human preferences is often neglected. This paper addresses this gap by first analyzing the distribution gap in codec language models, highlighting how it leads to discrepancies between the training and inference phases, which negatively affects performance. Then we explore leveraging learning from human feedback to bridge the distribution gap. We introduce SpeechAlign, an iterative self-improvement strategy that aligns speech language models to human preferences. SpeechAlign involves constructing a preference codec dataset contrasting golden codec tokens against synthetic tokens, followed by preference optimization to improve the codec language model. This cycle of improvement is carried out iteratively to steadily convert weak models to strong ones. Through both subjective and objective evaluations, we show that SpeechAlign can bridge the distribution gap and facilitating continuous self-improvement of the speech language model. Moreover, SpeechAlign exhibits robust generalization capabilities and works for smaller models. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/0nutation/SpeechGPT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05600v1,2024-04
MedExpQA: Multilingual Benchmarking of Large Language Models for Medical Question Answering,"Iñigo Alonso, Maite Oronoz, Rodrigo Agerri","Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential of facilitating the development of Artificial Intelligence technology to assist medical experts for interactive decision support, which has been demonstrated by their competitive performances in Medical QA. However, while impressive, the required quality bar for medical applications remains far from being achieved. Currently, LLMs remain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate hallucinated content. Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledge lack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible to evaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions. Finally, the situation is particularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other than English which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic. In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the first multilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in Medical Question Answering. To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for the first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs performance. Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the gold reference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches show that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for languages other than English. Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-art RAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining and integrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impact results on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering. So far the benchmark is available in four languages, but we hope that this work may encourage further development to other languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05590v2,2024-04
Enhancing Software-Related Information Extraction via Single-Choice Question Answering with Large Language Models,"Wolfgang Otto, Sharmila Upadhyaya, Stefan Dietze","This paper describes our participation in the Shared Task on Software Mentions Disambiguation (SOMD), with a focus on improving relation extraction in scholarly texts through generative Large Language Models (LLMs) using single-choice question-answering. The methodology prioritises the use of in-context learning capabilities of GLMs to extract software-related entities and their descriptive attributes, such as distributive information. Our approach uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and GLMs for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Attributive NER to identify relationships between extracted software entities, providing a structured solution for analysing software citations in academic literature. The paper provides a detailed description of our approach, demonstrating how using GLMs in a single-choice QA paradigm can greatly enhance IE methodologies. Our participation in the SOMD shared task highlights the importance of precise software citation practices and showcases our system's ability to overcome the challenges of disambiguating and extracting relationships between software mentions.

360$^\circ$REA: Towards A Reusable Experience Accumulation with 360° Assessment for Multi-Agent System,"Shen Gao, Hao Li, Chengrui Huang, Quan Tu, Zhiliang Tian, Minlie Huang, Shuo Shang","Large language model agents have demonstrated remarkable advancements across various complex tasks. Recent works focus on optimizing the agent team or employing self-reflection to iteratively solve complex tasks. Since these agents are all based on the same LLM, only conducting self-evaluation or removing underperforming agents does not substantively enhance the capability of the agents. We argue that a comprehensive evaluation and accumulating experience from evaluation feedback is an effective approach to improving system performance. In this paper, we propose Reusable Experience Accumulation with 360$^\circ$ Assessment (360$^\circ$REA), a hierarchical multi-agent framework inspired by corporate organizational practices. The framework employs a novel 360$^\circ$ performance assessment method for multi-perspective performance evaluation with fine-grained assessment. To enhance the capability of agents in addressing complex tasks, we introduce dual-level experience pool for agents to accumulate experience through fine-grained assessment. Extensive experiments on complex task datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of 360$^\circ$REA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05569v2,2024-04
"Dense Training, Sparse Inference: Rethinking Training of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models","Bowen Pan, Yikang Shen, Haokun Liu, Mayank Mishra, Gaoyuan Zhang, Aude Oliva, Colin Raffel, Rameswar Panda","Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models can reduce computational costs by 2-4$\times$ compared to dense models without sacrificing performance, making them more efficient in computation-bounded scenarios. However, MoE models generally require 2-4$\times$ times more parameters to achieve comparable performance to a dense model, which incurs larger GPU memory requirements and makes MoE models less efficient in I/O-bounded scenarios like autoregressive generation. In this work, we propose a hybrid dense training and sparse inference framework for MoE models (DS-MoE) which achieves strong computation and parameter efficiency by employing dense computation across all experts during training and sparse computation during inference. Our experiments on training LLMs demonstrate that our DS-MoE models are more parameter-efficient than standard sparse MoEs and are on par with dense models in terms of total parameter size and performance while being computationally cheaper (activating 30-40% of the model's parameters). Performance tests using vLLM show that our DS-MoE-6B model runs up to $1.86\times$ faster than similar dense models like Mistral-7B, and between $1.50\times$ and $1.71\times$ faster than comparable MoEs, such as DeepSeekMoE-16B and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05567v1,2024-04
Chinese Sequence Labeling with Semi-Supervised Boundary-Aware Language Model Pre-training,"Longhui Zhang, Dingkun Long, Meishan Zhang, Yanzhao Zhang, Pengjun Xie, Min Zhang","Chinese sequence labeling tasks are heavily reliant on accurate word boundary demarcation. Although current pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved substantial gains on these tasks, they rarely explicitly incorporate boundary information into the modeling process. An exception to this is BABERT, which incorporates unsupervised statistical boundary information into Chinese BERT's pre-training objectives. Building upon this approach, we input supervised high-quality boundary information to enhance BABERT's learning, developing a semi-supervised boundary-aware PLM. To assess PLMs' ability to encode boundaries, we introduce a novel ``Boundary Information Metric'' that is both simple and effective. This metric allows comparison of different PLMs without task-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results on Chinese sequence labeling datasets demonstrate that the improved BABERT variant outperforms the vanilla version, not only on these tasks but also more broadly across a range of Chinese natural language understanding tasks. Additionally, our proposed metric offers a convenient and accurate means of evaluating PLMs' boundary awareness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05560v1,2024-04
Evaluating Interventional Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models,"Tejas Kasetty, Divyat Mahajan, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite, Alexandre Drouin, Dhanya Sridhar","Numerous decision-making tasks require estimating causal effects under interventions on different parts of a system. As practitioners consider using large language models (LLMs) to automate decisions, studying their causal reasoning capabilities becomes crucial. A recent line of work evaluates LLMs ability to retrieve commonsense causal facts, but these evaluations do not sufficiently assess how LLMs reason about interventions. Motivated by the role that interventions play in causal inference, in this paper, we conduct empirical analyses to evaluate whether LLMs can accurately update their knowledge of a data-generating process in response to an intervention. We create benchmarks that span diverse causal graphs (e.g., confounding, mediation) and variable types, and enable a study of intervention-based reasoning. These benchmarks allow us to isolate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict changes resulting from their ability to memorize facts or find other shortcuts. We evaluate six LLMs on the benchmarks, finding that GPT models show promising accuracy at predicting the intervention effects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05545v2,2024-04
OPSD: an Offensive Persian Social media Dataset and its baseline evaluations,"Mehran Safayani, Amir Sartipi, Amir Hossein Ahmadi, Parniyan Jalali, Amir Hossein Mansouri, Mohammad Bisheh-Niasar, Zahra Pourbahman","The proliferation of hate speech and offensive comments on social media has become increasingly prevalent due to user activities. Such comments can have detrimental effects on individuals' psychological well-being and social behavior. While numerous datasets in the English language exist in this domain, few equivalent resources are available for Persian language. To address this gap, this paper introduces two offensive datasets. The first dataset comprises annotations provided by domain experts, while the second consists of a large collection of unlabeled data obtained through web crawling for unsupervised learning purposes. To ensure the quality of the former dataset, a meticulous three-stage labeling process was conducted, and kappa measures were computed to assess inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, experiments were performed on the dataset using state-of-the-art language models, both with and without employing masked language modeling techniques, as well as machine learning algorithms, in order to establish the baselines for the dataset using contemporary cutting-edge approaches. The obtained F1-scores for the three-class and two-class versions of the dataset were 76.9% and 89.9% for XLM-RoBERTa, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05540v1,2024-04
Best-of-Venom: Attacking RLHF by Injecting Poisoned Preference Data,"Tim Baumgärtner, Yang Gao, Dana Alon, Donald Metzler","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a popular method for aligning Language Models (LM) with human values and preferences. RLHF requires a large number of preference pairs as training data, which are often used in both the Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reward Model training and therefore publicly available datasets are commonly used. In this work, we study to what extent a malicious actor can manipulate the LMs generations by poisoning the preferences, i.e., injecting poisonous preference pairs into these datasets and the RLHF training process. We propose strategies to build poisonous preference pairs and test their performance by poisoning two widely used preference datasets. Our results show that preference poisoning is highly effective: injecting a small amount of poisonous data (1-5\% of the original dataset), we can effectively manipulate the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative). The findings from our experiments also shed light on strategies to defend against the preference poisoning attack.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05530v2,2024-04

RoT: Enhancing Large Language Models with Reflection on Search Trees,"Wenyang Hui, Kewei Tu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in reasoning and planning when integrated with tree-search-based prompting methods. However, since these methods ignore the previous search experiences, they often make the same mistakes in the search process. To address this issue, we introduce Reflection on search Trees (RoT), an LLM reflection framework designed to improve the performance of tree-search-based prompting methods. It uses a strong LLM to summarize guidelines from previous tree search experiences to enhance the ability of a weak LLM. The guidelines are instructions about solving this task through tree search which can prevent the weak LLMs from making similar mistakes in the past search process. In addition, we proposed a novel state selection method, which identifies the critical information from historical search processes to help RoT generate more specific and meaningful guidelines. In our extensive experiments, we find that RoT significantly improves the performance of LLMs in reasoning or planning tasks with various tree-search-based prompting methods (e.g., BFS and MCTS). Non-tree-search-based prompting methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can also benefit from RoT guidelines since RoT can provide task-specific knowledge collected from the search experience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05449v3,2024-04
XL$^2$Bench: A Benchmark for Extremely Long Context Understanding with Long-range Dependencies,"Xuanfan Ni, Hengyi Cai, Xiaochi Wei, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Piji Li","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks but are constrained by their small context window sizes. Various efforts have been proposed to expand the context window to accommodate even up to 200K input tokens. Meanwhile, building high-quality benchmarks with much longer text lengths and more demanding tasks to provide comprehensive evaluations is of immense practical interest to facilitate long context understanding research of LLMs. However, prior benchmarks create datasets that ostensibly cater to long-text comprehension by expanding the input of traditional tasks, which falls short to exhibit the unique characteristics of long-text understanding, including long dependency tasks and longer text length compatible with modern LLMs' context window size. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for extremely long context understanding with long-range dependencies, XL$^2$Bench, which includes three scenarios: Fiction Reading, Paper Reading, and Law Reading, and four tasks of increasing complexity: Memory Retrieval, Detailed Understanding, Overall Understanding, and Open-ended Generation, covering 27 subtasks in English and Chinese. It has an average length of 100K+ words (English) and 200K+ characters (Chinese). Evaluating six leading LLMs on XL$^2$Bench, we find that their performance significantly lags behind human levels.

Language Models on a Diet: Cost-Efficient Development of Encoders for Closely-Related Languages via Additional Pretraining,"Nikola Ljubešić, Vít Suchomel, Peter Rupnik, Taja Kuzman, Rik van Noord","The world of language models is going through turbulent times, better and ever larger models are coming out at an unprecedented speed. However, we argue that, especially for the scientific community, encoder models of up to 1 billion parameters are still very much needed, their primary usage being in enriching large collections of data with metadata necessary for downstream research. We investigate the best way to ensure the existence of such encoder models on the set of very closely related languages - Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin, by setting up a diverse benchmark for these languages, and comparing the trained-from-scratch models with the new models constructed via additional pretraining of existing multilingual models. We show that comparable performance to dedicated from-scratch models can be obtained by additionally pretraining available multilingual models even with a limited amount of computation. We also show that neighboring languages, in our case Slovenian, can be included in the additional pretraining with little to no loss in the performance of the final model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05428v1,2024-04
Relation Extraction Using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Acupuncture Point Locations,"Yiming Li, Xueqing Peng, Jianfu Li, Xu Zuo, Suyuan Peng, Donghong Pei, Cui Tao, Hua Xu, Na Hong","In acupuncture therapy, the accurate location of acupoints is essential for its effectiveness. The advanced language understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) present a significant opportunity for extracting relations related to acupoint locations from textual knowledge sources. This study aims to compare the performance of GPT with traditional deep learning models (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT)) in extracting acupoint-related location relations and assess the impact of pretraining and fine-tuning on GPT's performance. We utilized the World Health Organization Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region (WHO Standard) as our corpus, which consists of descriptions of 361 acupoints. Five types of relations ('direction_of,' 'distance_of,' 'part_of,' 'near_acupoint,' and 'located_near') (n= 3,174) between acupoints were annotated. Five models were compared: BioBERT, LSTM, pre-trained GPT-3.5, fine-tuned GPT-3.5, as well as pre-trained GPT-4. Performance metrics included micro-average exact match precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned GPT-3.5 consistently outperformed other models in F1 scores across all relation types. Overall, it achieved the highest micro-average F1 score of 0.92. This study underscores the effectiveness of LLMs like GPT in extracting relations related to acupoint locations, with implications for accurately modeling acupuncture knowledge and promoting standard implementation in acupuncture training and practice.

Know When To Stop: A Study of Semantic Drift in Text Generation,"Ava Spataru, Eric Hambro, Elena Voita, Nicola Cancedda","In this work, we explicitly show that modern LLMs tend to generate correct facts first, then ""drift away"" and generate incorrect facts later: this was occasionally observed but never properly measured. We develop a semantic drift score that measures the degree of separation between correct and incorrect facts in generated texts and confirm our hypothesis when generating Wikipedia-style biographies. This correct-then-incorrect generation pattern suggests that factual accuracy can be improved by knowing when to stop generation. Therefore, we explore the trade-off between information quantity and factual accuracy for several early stopping methods and manage to improve factuality by a large margin. We further show that reranking with semantic similarity can further improve these results, both compared to the baseline and when combined with early stopping. Finally, we try calling external API to bring the model back to the right generation path, but do not get positive results. Overall, our methods generalize and can be applied to any long-form text generation to produce more reliable information, by balancing trade-offs between factual accuracy, information quantity and computational cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05411v1,2024-04
PerkwE_COQA: Enhanced Persian Conversational Question Answering by combining contextual keyword extraction with Large Language Models,"Pardis Moradbeiki, Nasser Ghadiri","Smart cities need the involvement of their residents to enhance quality of life. Conversational query-answering is an emerging approach for user engagement. There is an increasing demand of an advanced conversational question-answering that goes beyond classic systems. Existing approaches have shown that LLMs offer promising capabilities for CQA, but may struggle to capture the nuances of conversational contexts. The new approach involves understanding the content and engaging in a multi-step conversation with the user to fulfill their needs. This paper presents a novel method to elevate the performance of Persian Conversational question-answering (CQA) systems. It combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with contextual keyword extraction. Our method extracts keywords specific to the conversational flow, providing the LLM with additional context to understand the user's intent and generate more relevant and coherent responses. We evaluated the effectiveness of this combined approach through various metrics, demonstrating significant improvements in CQA performance compared to an LLM-only baseline. The proposed method effectively handles implicit questions, delivers contextually relevant answers, and tackles complex questions that rely heavily on conversational context. The findings indicate that our method outperformed the evaluation benchmarks up to 8% higher than existing methods and the LLM-only baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05406v2,2024-04
"Physics of Language Models: Part 3.3, Knowledge Capacity Scaling Laws","Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li","Scaling laws describe the relationship between the size of language models and their capabilities. Unlike prior studies that evaluate a model's capability via loss or benchmarks, we estimate the number of knowledge bits a model stores. We focus on factual knowledge represented as tuples, such as (USA, capital, Washington D.C.) from a Wikipedia page. Through multiple controlled datasets, we establish that language models can and only can store 2 bits of knowledge per parameter, even when quantized to int8, and such knowledge can be flexibly extracted for downstream applications. Consequently, a 7B model can store 14B bits of knowledge, surpassing the English Wikipedia and textbooks combined based on our estimation.   More broadly, we present 12 results on how (1) training duration, (2) model architecture, (3) quantization, (4) sparsity constraints such as MoE, and (5) data signal-to-noise ratio affect a model's knowledge storage capacity. Notable insights include:   * The GPT-2 architecture, with rotary embedding, matches or even surpasses LLaMA/Mistral architectures in knowledge storage, particularly over shorter training durations. This arises because LLaMA/Mistral uses GatedMLP, which is less stable and harder to train.   * Prepending training data with domain names (e.g., wikipedia.org) significantly increases a model's knowledge capacity. Language models can autonomously identify and prioritize domains rich in knowledge, optimizing their storage capacity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05405v1,2024-04
SafetyPrompts: a Systematic Review of Open Datasets for Evaluating and Improving Large Language Model Safety,"Paul Röttger, Fabio Pernisi, Bertie Vidgen, Dirk Hovy","The last two years have seen a rapid growth in concerns around the safety of large language models (LLMs). Researchers and practitioners have met these concerns by introducing an abundance of new datasets for evaluating and improving LLM safety. However, much of this work has happened in parallel, and with very different goals in mind, ranging from the mitigation of near-term risks around bias and toxic content generation to the assessment of longer-term catastrophic risk potential. This makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to find the most relevant datasets for a given use case, and to identify gaps in dataset coverage that future work may fill. To remedy these issues, we conduct a first systematic review of open datasets for evaluating and improving LLM safety. We review 102 datasets, which we identified through an iterative and community-driven process over the course of several months. We highlight patterns and trends, such as a a trend towards fully synthetic datasets, as well as gaps in dataset coverage, such as a clear lack of non-English datasets. We also examine how LLM safety datasets are used in practice -- in LLM release publications and popular LLM benchmarks -- finding that current evaluation practices are highly idiosyncratic and make use of only a small fraction of available datasets. Our contributions are based on SafetyPrompts.com, a living catalogue of open datasets for LLM safety, which we commit to updating continuously as the field of LLM safety develops.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05399v1,2024-04

Towards Objectively Benchmarking Social Intelligence for Language Agents at Action Level,"Chenxu Wang, Bin Dai, Huaping Liu, Baoyuan Wang","Prominent large language models have exhibited human-level performance in many domains, even enabling the derived agents to simulate human and social interactions. While practical works have substantiated the practicability of grounding language agents in sandbox simulation or embodied simulators, current social intelligence benchmarks either stay at the language level or use subjective metrics. In pursuit of a more realistic and objective evaluation, we introduce the Social Tasks in Sandbox Simulation (STSS) benchmark, which assesses language agents \textbf{objectively} at the \textbf{action level} by scrutinizing the goal achievements within the multi-agent simulation. Additionally, we sample conversation scenarios to build a language-level benchmark to provide an economically prudent preliminary evaluation and align with prevailing benchmarks. To gauge the significance of agent architecture, we implement a target-driven planning (TDP) module as an adjunct to the existing agent. Our evaluative findings highlight that the STSS benchmark is challenging for state-of-the-art language agents. Furthermore, it effectively discriminates between distinct language agents, suggesting its usefulness as a benchmark for evaluating both language models and agent architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05337v1,2024-04
PORTULAN ExtraGLUE Datasets and Models: Kick-starting a Benchmark for the Neural Processing of Portuguese,"Tomás Osório, Bernardo Leite, Henrique Lopes Cardoso, Luís Gomes, João Rodrigues, Rodrigo Santos, António Branco","Leveraging research on the neural modelling of Portuguese, we contribute a collection of datasets for an array of language processing tasks and a corresponding collection of fine-tuned neural language models on these downstream tasks. To align with mainstream benchmarks in the literature, originally developed in English, and to kick start their Portuguese counterparts, the datasets were machine-translated from English with a state-of-the-art translation engine. The resulting PORTULAN ExtraGLUE benchmark is a basis for research on Portuguese whose improvement can be pursued in future work. Similarly, the respective fine-tuned neural language models, developed with a low-rank adaptation approach, are made available as baselines that can stimulate future work on the neural processing of Portuguese.

Multi-Task Learning for Features Extraction in Financial Annual Reports,"Syrielle Montariol, Matej Martinc, Andraž Pelicon, Senja Pollak, Boshko Koloski, Igor Lončarski, Aljoša Valentinčič","For assessing various performance indicators of companies, the focus is shifting from strictly financial (quantitative) publicly disclosed information to qualitative (textual) information. This textual data can provide valuable weak signals, for example through stylistic features, which can complement the quantitative data on financial performance or on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. In this work, we use various multi-task learning methods for financial text classification with the focus on financial sentiment, objectivity, forward-looking sentence prediction and ESG-content detection. We propose different methods to combine the information extracted from training jointly on different tasks; our best-performing method highlights the positive effect of explicitly adding auxiliary task predictions as features for the final target task during the multi-task training. Next, we use these classifiers to extract textual features from annual reports of FTSE350 companies and investigate the link between ESG quantitative scores and these features.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05281v1,2024-04
Xiwu: A Basis Flexible and Learnable LLM for High Energy Physics,"Zhengde Zhang, Yiyu Zhang, Haodong Yao, Jianwen Luo, Rui Zhao, Bo Huang, Jiameng Zhao, Yipu Liao, Ke Li, Lina Zhao, Jun Cao, Fazhi Qi, Changzheng Yuan","Large Language Models (LLMs) are undergoing a period of rapid updates and changes, with state-of-the-art (SOTA) model frequently being replaced. When applying LLMs to a specific scientific field, it's challenging to acquire unique domain knowledge while keeping the model itself advanced. To address this challenge, a sophisticated large language model system named as Xiwu has been developed, allowing you switch between the most advanced foundation models and quickly teach the model domain knowledge. In this work, we will report on the best practices for applying LLMs in the field of high-energy physics (HEP), including: a seed fission technology is proposed and some data collection and cleaning tools are developed to quickly obtain domain AI-Ready dataset; a just-in-time learning system is implemented based on the vector store technology; an on-the-fly fine-tuning system has been developed to facilitate rapid training under a specified foundation model. The results show that Xiwu can smoothly switch between foundation models such as LLaMA, Vicuna, ChatGLM and Grok-1. The trained Xiwu model is significantly outperformed the benchmark model on the HEP knowledge question-and-answering and code generation. This strategy significantly enhances the potential for growth of our model's performance, with the hope of surpassing GPT-4 as it evolves with the development of open-source models. This work provides a customized LLM for the field of HEP, while also offering references for applying LLM to other fields, the corresponding codes are available on Github.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08001v1,2024-04
EFSA: Towards Event-Level Financial Sentiment Analysis,"Tianyu Chen, Yiming Zhang, Guoxin Yu, Dapeng Zhang, Li Zeng, Qing He, Xiang Ao","In this paper, we extend financial sentiment analysis~(FSA) to event-level since events usually serve as the subject of the sentiment in financial text. Though extracting events from the financial text may be conducive to accurate sentiment predictions, it has specialized challenges due to the lengthy and discontinuity of events in a financial text. To this end, we reconceptualize the event extraction as a classification task by designing a categorization comprising coarse-grained and fine-grained event categories. Under this setting, we formulate the \textbf{E}vent-Level \textbf{F}inancial \textbf{S}entiment \textbf{A}nalysis~(\textbf{EFSA} for short) task that outputs quintuples consisting of (company, industry, coarse-grained event, fine-grained event, sentiment) from financial text. A large-scale Chinese dataset containing $12,160$ news articles and $13,725$ quintuples is publicized as a brand new testbed for our task. A four-hop Chain-of-Thought LLM-based approach is devised for this task. Systematically investigations are conducted on our dataset, and the empirical results demonstrate the benchmarking scores of existing methods and our proposed method can reach the current state-of-the-art.

Interpreting Themes from Educational Stories,"Yigeng Zhang, Fabio A. González, Thamar Solorio","Reading comprehension continues to be a crucial research focus in the NLP community. Recent advances in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) have mostly centered on literal comprehension, referring to the surface-level understanding of content. In this work, we focus on the next level - interpretive comprehension, with a particular emphasis on inferring the themes of a narrative text. We introduce the first dataset specifically designed for interpretive comprehension of educational narratives, providing corresponding well-edited theme texts. The dataset spans a variety of genres and cultural origins and includes human-annotated theme keywords with varying levels of granularity. We further formulate NLP tasks under different abstractions of interpretive comprehension toward the main idea of a story. After conducting extensive experiments with state-of-the-art methods, we found the task to be both challenging and significant for NLP research.

Supervised Gradual Machine Learning for Aspect Category Detection,"Murtadha Ahmed, Qun Chen","Aspect Category Detection (ACD) aims to identify implicit and explicit aspects in a given review sentence. The state-of-the-art approaches for ACD use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to address the problem as a multi-label classification task. However, learning category-specific representations heavily rely on the amount of labeled examples, which may not readily available in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle the ACD task by combining DNNs with Gradual Machine Learning (GML) in a supervised setting. we aim to leverage the strength of DNN in semantic relation modeling, which can facilitate effective knowledge transfer between labeled and unlabeled instances during the gradual inference of GML. To achieve this, we first analyze the learned latent space of the DNN to model the relations, i.e., similar or opposite, between instances. We then represent these relations as binary features in a factor graph to efficiently convey knowledge. Finally, we conduct a comparative study of our proposed solution on real benchmark datasets and demonstrate that the GML approach, in collaboration with DNNs for feature extraction, consistently outperforms pure DNN solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05245v1,2024-04
Product Description and QA Assisted Self-Supervised Opinion Summarization,"Tejpalsingh Siledar, Rupasai Rangaraju, Sankara Sri Raghava Ravindra Muddu, Suman Banerjee, Amey Patil, Sudhanshu Shekhar Singh, Muthusamy Chelliah, Nikesh Garera, Swaprava Nath, Pushpak Bhattacharyya","In e-commerce, opinion summarization is the process of summarizing the consensus opinions found in product reviews. However, the potential of additional sources such as product description and question-answers (QA) has been considered less often. Moreover, the absence of any supervised training data makes this task challenging. To address this, we propose a novel synthetic dataset creation (SDC) strategy that leverages information from reviews as well as additional sources for selecting one of the reviews as a pseudo-summary to enable supervised training. Our Multi-Encoder Decoder framework for Opinion Summarization (MEDOS) employs a separate encoder for each source, enabling effective selection of information while generating the summary. For evaluation, due to the unavailability of test sets with additional sources, we extend the Amazon, Oposum+, and Flipkart test sets and leverage ChatGPT to annotate summaries. Experiments across nine test sets demonstrate that the combination of our SDC approach and MEDOS model achieves on average a 14.5% improvement in ROUGE-1 F1 over the SOTA. Moreover, comparative analysis underlines the significance of incorporating additional sources for generating more informative summaries. Human evaluations further indicate that MEDOS scores relatively higher in coherence and fluency with 0.41 and 0.5 (-1 to 1) respectively, compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate opinion summaries leveraging additional sources in a self-supervised setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05243v1,2024-04
LayoutLLM: Layout Instruction Tuning with Large Language Models for Document Understanding,"Chuwei Luo, Yufan Shen, Zhaoqing Zhu, Qi Zheng, Zhi Yu, Cong Yao","Recently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) or multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for document understanding has been proven very promising. However, previous works that employ LLMs/MLLMs for document understanding have not fully explored and utilized the document layout information, which is vital for precise document understanding. In this paper, we propose LayoutLLM, an LLM/MLLM based method for document understanding. The core of LayoutLLM is a layout instruction tuning strategy, which is specially designed to enhance the comprehension and utilization of document layouts. The proposed layout instruction tuning strategy consists of two components: Layout-aware Pre-training and Layout-aware Supervised Fine-tuning. To capture the characteristics of document layout in Layout-aware Pre-training, three groups of pre-training tasks, corresponding to document-level, region-level and segment-level information, are introduced. Furthermore, a novel module called layout chain-of-thought (LayoutCoT) is devised to enable LayoutLLM to focus on regions relevant to the question and generate accurate answers. LayoutCoT is effective for boosting the performance of document understanding. Meanwhile, it brings a certain degree of interpretability, which could facilitate manual inspection and correction. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that the proposed LayoutLLM significantly outperforms existing methods that adopt open-source 7B LLMs/MLLMs for document understanding. The training data of the LayoutLLM is publicly available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/AdvancedLiterateMachinery/tree/main/DocumentUnderstanding/LayoutLLM",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05225v1,2024-04

Despite the flux of research on developing advanced reasoning approaches, systematically analyzing the diverse LLMs and reasoning strategies in generating reasoning chains remains a significant challenge. The difficulties stem from the lack of two key elements: (1) an automatic method for evaluating the generated reasoning chains on different tasks, and (2) a unified formalism and implementation of the diverse reasoning approaches for systematic comparison. This paper aims to close the gap: (1) We introduce AutoRace for fully automated reasoning chain evaluation. Existing metrics rely on expensive human annotations or pre-defined LLM prompts not adaptable to different tasks. In contrast, AutoRace automatically creates detailed evaluation criteria tailored for each task, and uses GPT-4 for accurate evaluation following the criteria. (2) We develop LLM Reasoners, a library for standardized modular implementation of existing and new reasoning algorithms, under a unified formulation of the search, reward, and world model components. With the new evaluation and library, (3) we conduct extensive study of different reasoning approaches (e.g., CoT, ToT, RAP).

Bidirectional Long-Range Parser for Sequential Data Understanding,"George Leotescu, Daniel Voinea, Alin-Ionut Popa","The transformer is a powerful data modelling framework responsible for remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks. However, they are limited in terms of scalability as it is suboptimal and inefficient to process long-sequence data. To this purpose we introduce BLRP (Bidirectional Long-Range Parser), a novel and versatile attention mechanism designed to increase performance and efficiency on long-sequence tasks. It leverages short and long range heuristics in the form of a local sliding window approach combined with a global bidirectional latent space synthesis technique. We show the benefits and versatility of our approach on vision and language domains by demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art methods on the Long-Range-Arena and CIFAR benchmarks together with ablations demonstrating the computational efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05210v1,2024-04
Have You Merged My Model? On The Robustness of Large Language Model IP Protection Methods Against Model Merging,"Tianshuo Cong, Delong Ran, Zesen Liu, Xinlei He, Jinyuan Liu, Yichen Gong, Qi Li, Anyu Wang, Xiaoyun Wang","Model merging is a promising lightweight model empowerment technique that does not rely on expensive computing devices (e.g., GPUs) or require the collection of specific training data. Instead, it involves editing different upstream model parameters to absorb their downstream task capabilities. However, uncertified model merging can infringe upon the Intellectual Property (IP) rights of the original upstream models. In this paper, we conduct the first study on the robustness of IP protection methods under model merging scenarios. Specifically, we investigate two state-of-the-art IP protection techniques: Quantization Watermarking and Instructional Fingerprint, along with various advanced model merging technologies, such as Task Arithmetic, TIES-MERGING, and so on. Experimental results indicate that current Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking techniques cannot survive in the merged models, whereas model fingerprinting techniques can. Our research aims to highlight that model merging should be an indispensable consideration in the robustness assessment of model IP protection techniques, thereby promoting the healthy development of the open-source LLM community.

DLoRA: Distributed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Solution for Large Language Model,"Chao Gao, Sai Qian Zhang","To enhance the performance of large language models (LLM) on downstream tasks, one solution is to fine-tune certain LLM parameters and make it better align with the characteristics of the training dataset. This process is commonly known as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Due to the scale of LLM, PEFT operations are usually executed in the public environment (e.g., cloud server). This necessitates the sharing of sensitive user data across public environments, thereby raising potential privacy concerns. To tackle these challenges, we propose a distributed PEFT framework called DLoRA. DLoRA enables scalable PEFT operations to be performed collaboratively between the cloud and user devices. Coupled with the proposed Kill and Revive algorithm, the evaluation results demonstrate that DLoRA can significantly reduce the computation and communication workload over the user devices while achieving superior accuracy and privacy protection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05182v1,2024-04
Linguistic Changes in Spontaneous Speech for Detecting Parkinsons Disease Using Large Language Models,Jonathan Crawford,"Parkinsons disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with over ten million active cases worldwide and one million new diagnoses per year. Detecting and subsequently diagnosing the disease is challenging because of symptom heterogeneity with respect to complexity, as well as the type and timing of phenotypic manifestations. Typically, language impairment can present in the prodromal phase and precede motor symptoms suggesting that a linguistic-based approach could serve as a diagnostic method for incipient Parkinsons disease. Additionally, improved linguistic models may enhance other approaches through ensemble techniques. The field of large language models is advancing rapidly, presenting the opportunity to explore the use of these new models for detecting Parkinsons disease and to improve on current linguistic approaches with high-dimensional representations of linguistics. We evaluate the application of state-of-the-art large language models to detect Parkinsons disease automatically from spontaneous speech with up to 73% accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05160v1,2024-04
Semantic Stealth: Adversarial Text Attacks on NLP Using Several Methods,"Roopkatha Dey, Aivy Debnath, Sayak Kumar Dutta, Kaustav Ghosh, Arijit Mitra, Arghya Roy Chowdhury, Jaydip Sen","In various real-world applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering, a pivotal role is played by NLP models, facilitating efficient communication and decision-making processes in domains ranging from healthcare to finance. However, a significant challenge is posed to the robustness of these natural language processing models by text adversarial attacks. These attacks involve the deliberate manipulation of input text to mislead the predictions of the model while maintaining human interpretability. Despite the remarkable performance achieved by state-of-the-art models like BERT in various natural language processing tasks, they are found to remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in the input text. In addressing the vulnerability of text classifiers to adversarial attacks, three distinct attack mechanisms are explored in this paper using the victim model BERT: BERT-on-BERT attack, PWWS attack, and Fraud Bargain's Attack (FBA). Leveraging the IMDB, AG News, and SST2 datasets, a thorough comparative analysis is conducted to assess the effectiveness of these attacks on the BERT classifier model. It is revealed by the analysis that PWWS emerges as the most potent adversary, consistently outperforming other methods across multiple evaluation scenarios, thereby emphasizing its efficacy in generating adversarial examples for text classification. Through comprehensive experimentation, the performance of these attacks is assessed and the findings indicate that the PWWS attack outperforms others, demonstrating lower runtime, higher accuracy, and favorable semantic similarity scores. The key insight of this paper lies in the assessment of the relative performances of three prevalent state-of-the-art attack mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05159v1,2024-04

However, the manual creation of these documents is not only time-consuming but also prone to inconsistencies and potential errors. The automation of this documentation process using artificial intelligence (AI) represents a promising area of innovation in healthcare. This study directly addresses the inefficiencies and inaccuracies in creating discharge notes manually, particularly for cardiac patients, by employing AI techniques, specifically large language model (LLM). Utilizing a substantial dataset from a cardiology center, encompassing wide-ranging medical records and physician assessments, our research evaluates the capability of LLM to enhance the documentation process. Among the various models assessed, Mistral-7B distinguished itself by accurately generating discharge notes that significantly improve both documentation efficiency and the continuity of care for patients. These notes underwent rigorous qualitative evaluation by medical expert, receiving high marks for their clinical relevance, completeness, readability, and contribution to informed decision-making and care planning. Coupled with quantitative analyses, these results confirm Mistral-7B's efficacy in distilling complex medical information into concise, coherent summaries. Overall, our findings illuminate the considerable promise of specialized LLM, such as Mistral-7B, in refining healthcare documentation workflows and advancing patient care.

Plug and Play with Prompts: A Prompt Tuning Approach for Controlling Text Generation,"Rohan Deepak Ajwani, Zining Zhu, Jonathan Rose, Frank Rudzicz","Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional language generation capabilities in response to text-based prompts. However, controlling the direction of generation via textual prompts has been challenging, especially with smaller models. In this work, we explore the use of Prompt Tuning to achieve controlled language generation. Generated text is steered using prompt embeddings, which are trained using a small language model, used as a discriminator. Moreover, we demonstrate that these prompt embeddings can be trained with a very small dataset, with as low as a few hundred training examples. Our method thus offers a data and parameter efficient solution towards controlling language model outputs. We carry out extensive evaluation on four datasets: SST-5 and Yelp (sentiment analysis), GYAFC (formality) and JIGSAW (toxic language). Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method towards mitigating harmful, toxic, and biased text generated by language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05143v1,2024-04

While recent years have seen increasing work revolving around climate-centric discourse, crucial environmental and ecological topics outside of climate change remain largely unaddressed, despite their prominent importance. Mainstream NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, dominate the scene, but there remains an untouched space in the literature involving the analysis of environmental impacts of certain events and practices. To address this gap, this paper presents EcoVerse, an annotated English Twitter dataset of 3,023 tweets spanning a wide spectrum of environmental topics. We propose a three-level annotation scheme designed for Eco-Relevance Classification, Stance Detection, and introducing an original approach for Environmental Impact Analysis. We detail the data collection, filtering, and labeling process that led to the creation of the dataset. Remarkable Inter-Annotator Agreement indicates that the annotation scheme produces consistent annotations of high quality.

Our study employed the latest fine-tuning methodologies together with open-sourced LLMs, and demonstrated a practical and efficient approach to automating the final execution stages of an SLR process that involves knowledge synthesis. The results maintained high fidelity in factual accuracy in LLM responses, and were validated through the replication of an existing PRISMA-conforming SLR. Our research proposed solutions for mitigating LLM hallucination and proposed mechanisms for tracking LLM responses to their sources of information, thus demonstrating how this approach can meet the rigorous demands of scholarly research. The findings ultimately confirmed the potential of fine-tuned LLMs in streamlining various labor-intensive processes of conducting literature reviews. Given the potential of this approach and its applicability across all research domains, this foundational study also advocated for updating PRISMA reporting guidelines to incorporate AI-driven processes, ensuring methodological transparency and reliability in future SLRs.

MM-MATH: Advancing Multimodal Math Evaluation with Process Evaluation and Fine-grained Classification,"Kai Sun, Yushi Bai, Ji Qi, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li","To advance the evaluation of multimodal math reasoning in large multimodal models (LMMs), this paper introduces a novel benchmark, MM-MATH. MM-MATH consists of 5,929 open-ended middle school math problems with visual contexts, with fine-grained classification across difficulty, grade level, and knowledge points. Unlike existing benchmarks relying on binary answer comparison, MM-MATH incorporates both outcome and process evaluations. Process evaluation employs LMM-as-a-judge to automatically analyze solution steps, identifying and categorizing errors into specific error types. Extensive evaluation of ten models on MM-MATH reveals significant challenges for existing LMMs, highlighting their limited utilization of visual information and struggles with higher-difficulty problems. The best-performing model achieves only 31% accuracy on MM-MATH, compared to 82% for humans. This highlights the challenging nature of our benchmark for existing models and the significant gap between the multimodal reasoning capabilities of current models and humans. Our process evaluation reveals that diagram misinterpretation is the most common error, accounting for more than half of the total error cases, underscoring the need for improved image comprehension in multimodal reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05091v4,2024-04
How Bad is Training on Synthetic Data? A Statistical Analysis of Language Model Collapse,"Mohamed El Amine Seddik, Suei-Wen Chen, Soufiane Hayou, Pierre Youssef, Merouane Debbah","The phenomenon of model collapse, introduced in (Shumailov et al., 2023), refers to the deterioration in performance that occurs when new models are trained on synthetic data generated from previously trained models. This recursive training loop makes the tails of the original distribution disappear, thereby making future-generation models forget about the initial (real) distribution. With the aim of rigorously understanding model collapse in language models, we consider in this paper a statistical model that allows us to characterize the impact of various recursive training scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that model collapse cannot be avoided when training solely on synthetic data. However, when mixing both real and synthetic data, we provide an estimate of a maximal amount of synthetic data below which model collapse can eventually be avoided. Our theoretical conclusions are further supported by empirical validations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05090v1,2024-04

Despite their promise, MoEs face challenges, particularly in terms of memory requirements. To address this, our work introduces SEER-MoE, a novel two-stage framework for reducing both the memory footprint and compute requirements of pre-trained MoE models. The first stage involves pruning the total number of experts using a heavy-hitters counting guidance, while the second stage employs a regularization-based fine-tuning strategy to recover accuracy loss and reduce the number of activated experts during inference.

How much reliable is ChatGPT's prediction on Information Extraction under Input Perturbations?,"Ishani Mondal, Abhilasha Sancheti","In this paper, we assess the robustness (reliability) of ChatGPT under input perturbations for one of the most fundamental tasks of Information Extraction (IE) i.e. Named Entity Recognition (NER). Despite the hype, the majority of the researchers have vouched for its language understanding and generation capabilities; a little attention has been paid to understand its robustness: How the input-perturbations affect 1) the predictions, 2) the confidence of predictions and 3) the quality of rationale behind its prediction. We perform a systematic analysis of ChatGPT's robustness (under both zero-shot and few-shot setup) on two NER datasets using both automatic and human evaluation. Based on automatic evaluation metrics, we find that 1) ChatGPT is more brittle on Drug or Disease replacements (rare entities) compared to the perturbations on widely known Person or Location entities, 2) the quality of explanations for the same entity considerably differ under different types of ""Entity-Specific"" and ""Context-Specific"" perturbations and the quality can be significantly improved using in-context learning, and 3) it is overconfident for majority of the incorrect predictions, and hence it could lead to misguidance of the end-users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05088v1,2024-04

HaVTR: Improving Video-Text Retrieval Through Augmentation Using Large Foundation Models,"Yimu Wang, Shuai Yuan, Xiangru Jian, Wei Pang, Mushi Wang, Ning Yu","While recent progress in video-text retrieval has been driven by the exploration of powerful model architectures and training strategies, the representation learning ability of video-text retrieval models is still limited due to low-quality and scarce training data annotations. To address this issue, we present a novel video-text learning paradigm, HaVTR, which augments video and text data to learn more generalized features. Specifically, we first adopt a simple augmentation method, which generates self-similar data by randomly duplicating or dropping subwords and frames. In addition, inspired by the recent advancement in visual and language generative models, we propose a more powerful augmentation method through textual paraphrasing and video stylization using large language models (LLMs) and visual generative models (VGMs). Further, to bring richer information into video and text, we propose a hallucination-based augmentation method, where we use LLMs and VGMs to generate and add new relevant information to the original data. Benefiting from the enriched data, extensive experiments on several video-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of HaVTR over existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05083v1,2024-04
QRscript: Embedding a Programming Language in QR codes to support Decision and Management,"Stefano Scanzio, Gianluca Cena, Adriano Valenzano","Embedding a programming language in a QR code is a new and extremely promising opportunity, as it makes devices and objects smarter without necessarily requiring an Internet connection. In this paper, all the steps needed to translate a program written in a high-level programming language to its binary representation encoded in a QR code, and the opposite process that, starting from the QR code, executes it by means of a virtual machine, have been carefully detailed. The proposed programming language was named QRscript, and can be easily extended so as to integrate new features. One of the main design goals was to produce a very compact target binary code. In particular, in this work we propose a specific sub-language (a dialect) that is aimed at encoding decision trees. Besides industrial scenarios, this is useful in many other application fields. The reported example, related to the configuration of an industrial networked device, highlights the potential of the proposed technology, and permits to better understand all the translation steps.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05073v1,2024-04
FGAIF: Aligning Large Vision-Language Models with Fine-grained AI Feedback,"Liqiang Jing, Xinya Du","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in tackling a variety of visual-language tasks. However, current LVLMs suffer from misalignment between text and image modalities which causes three kinds of hallucination problems, i.e., object existence, object attribute, and object relationship. To tackle this issue, existing methods mainly utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) to align modalities in LVLMs. However, they still suffer from three main limitations: (1) General feedback can not indicate the hallucination type contained in the response; (2) Sparse rewards only give the sequence-level reward for the whole response; and (3)Annotation cost is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To handle these limitations, we propose an innovative method to align modalities in LVLMs through Fine-Grained Artificial Intelligence Feedback (FGAIF), which mainly consists of three steps: AI-based Feedback Collection, Fine-grained Reward Model Training, and Reinforcement Learning with Fine-grained Reward. Specifically, We first utilize AI tools to predict the types of hallucination for each segment in the response and obtain a collection of fine-grained feedback. Then, based on the collected reward data, three specialized reward models are trained to produce dense rewards. Finally, a novel fine-grained feedback module is integrated into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on hallucination and general benchmarks, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed method. Notably, compared with previous models trained with the RL-based aligning method, our proposed method is effective even with fewer parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05046v1,2024-04
Shortcut-connected Expert Parallelism for Accelerating Mixture-of-Experts,"Weilin Cai, Juyong Jiang, Le Qin, Junwei Cui, Sunghun Kim, Jiayi Huang","Expert parallelism has been introduced as a strategy to distribute the computational workload of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) models across multiple computing devices, facilitating the execution of these increasingly large-scale models. However, the All-to-All communication intrinsic to expert parallelism constitutes a significant overhead, diminishing the MoE models' efficiency. Current optimization approaches offer some relief, yet they are constrained by the sequential interdependence of communication and computation operations. To address this limitation, we present a novel shortcut-connected MoE (ScMoE) architecture with an overlapping parallel strategy, which effectively decouples communication from its conventional sequence, allowing for a substantial overlap of 70% to 100% with computation. When compared with the prevalent top-2 MoE architecture, ScMoE demonstrates training speed improvements of 30% and 11%, and inference improvements of 40% and 15%, in our distributed environments with PCIe and NVLink hardware, respectively, where communication constitutes 60% and 15% of the total MoE time consumption. Building on the ScMoE architecture, we further implement an expert offloading strategy to facilitate memory-limited inference, optimizing latency through the overlap of expert migration. Additionally, extensive experiments and theoretical analyses indicate that ScMoE not only achieves comparable but in some instances surpasses the model quality of existing approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05019v2,2024-04
Towards Reliable and Empathetic Depression-Diagnosis-Oriented Chats,"Kunyao Lan, Cong Ming, Binwei Yao, Lu Chen, Mengyue Wu","Chatbots can serve as a viable tool for preliminary depression diagnosis via interactive conversations with potential patients. Nevertheless, the blend of task-oriented and chit-chat in diagnosis-related dialogues necessitates professional expertise and empathy. Such unique requirements challenge traditional dialogue frameworks geared towards single optimization goals. To address this, we propose an innovative ontology definition and generation framework tailored explicitly for depression diagnosis dialogues, combining the reliability of task-oriented conversations with the appeal of empathy-related chit-chat. We further apply the framework to D$^4$, the only existing public dialogue dataset on depression diagnosis-oriented chats. Exhaustive experimental results indicate significant improvements in task completion and emotional support generation in depression diagnosis, fostering a more comprehensive approach to task-oriented chat dialogue system development and its applications in digital mental health.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05012v1,2024-04
A geometric framework for interstellar discourse on fundamental physical structures,"Giampiero Esposito, Valeria Fionda","This paper considers the possibility that abstract thinking and advanced synthesis skills might encourage extraterrestrial civilizations to accept communication with mankind on Earth. For this purpose, a notation not relying upon the use of alphabet and numbers is proposed, in order to denote just some basic geometric structures of current physical theories: vector fields, one-form fields, and tensor fields of arbitrary order. An advanced civilization might appreciate the way here proposed to achieve a concise description of electromagnetism and general relativity, and hence it might accept the challenge of responding to our signals. The abstract symbols introduced in this paper to describe the basic structures of physical theories are encoded into black and white bitmap images that can be easily converted into short bit sequences and modulated on a carrier wave for radio transmission.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02314v1,2024-04
Adapting LLMs for Efficient Context Processing through Soft Prompt Compression,"Cangqing Wang, Yutian Yang, Ruisi Li, Dan Sun, Ruicong Cai, Yuzhu Zhang, Chengqian Fu, Lillian Floyd","The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inaugurated a transformative epoch in natural language processing, fostering unprecedented proficiency in text generation, comprehension, and contextual scrutiny. Nevertheless, effectively handling extensive contexts, crucial for myriad applications, poses a formidable obstacle owing to the intrinsic constraints of the models' context window sizes and the computational burdens entailed by their operations. This investigation presents an innovative framework that strategically tailors LLMs for streamlined context processing by harnessing the synergies among natural language summarization, soft prompt compression, and augmented utility preservation mechanisms. Our methodology, dubbed SoftPromptComp, amalgamates natural language prompts extracted from summarization methodologies with dynamically generated soft prompts to forge a concise yet semantically robust depiction of protracted contexts. This depiction undergoes further refinement via a weighting mechanism optimizing information retention and utility for subsequent tasks. We substantiate that our framework markedly diminishes computational overhead and enhances LLMs' efficacy across various benchmarks, while upholding or even augmenting the caliber of the produced content. By amalgamating soft prompt compression with sophisticated summarization, SoftPromptComp confronts the dual challenges of managing lengthy contexts and ensuring model scalability. Our findings point towards a propitious trajectory for augmenting LLMs' applicability and efficiency, rendering them more versatile and pragmatic for real-world applications. This research enriches the ongoing discourse on optimizing language models, providing insights into the potency of soft prompts and summarization techniques as pivotal instruments for the forthcoming generation of NLP solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04997v2,2024-04
MLaKE: Multilingual Knowledge Editing Benchmark for Large Language Models,"Zihao Wei, Jingcheng Deng, Liang Pang, Hanxing Ding, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng","The extensive utilization of large language models (LLMs) underscores the crucial necessity for precise and contemporary knowledge embedded within their intrinsic parameters. Existing research on knowledge editing primarily concentrates on monolingual scenarios, neglecting the complexities presented by multilingual contexts and multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, our study introduces MLaKE (Multilingual Language Knowledge Editing), a novel benchmark comprising 4072 multi-hop and 5360 single-hop questions designed to evaluate the adaptability of knowledge editing methods across five languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, French, and German. MLaKE aggregates fact chains from Wikipedia across languages and utilizes LLMs to generate questions in both free-form and multiple-choice. We evaluate the multilingual knowledge editing generalization capabilities of existing methods on MLaKE. Existing knowledge editing methods demonstrate higher success rates in English samples compared to other languages. However, their generalization capabilities are limited in multi-language experiments. Notably, existing knowledge editing methods often show relatively high generalization for languages within the same language family compared to languages from different language families. These results underscore the imperative need for advancements in multilingual knowledge editing and we hope MLaKE can serve as a valuable resource for benchmarking and solution development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04990v2,2024-04

A Two Dimensional Feature Engineering Method for Relation Extraction,"Hao Wang, Yanping Chen, Weizhe Yang, Yongbin Qin, Ruizhang Huang","Transforming a sentence into a two-dimensional (2D) representation (e.g., the table filling) has the ability to unfold a semantic plane, where an element of the plane is a word-pair representation of a sentence which may denote a possible relation representation composed of two named entities. The 2D representation is effective in resolving overlapped relation instances. However, in related works, the representation is directly transformed from a raw input. It is weak to utilize prior knowledge, which is important to support the relation extraction task. In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional feature engineering method in the 2D sentence representation for relation extraction. Our proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets (ACE05 Chinese, ACE05 English, and SanWen) and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The results indicate that two-dimensional feature engineering can take advantage of a two-dimensional sentence representation and make full use of prior knowledge in traditional feature engineering.

However, each field encompasses a variety of specific tasks that require learning, and the diverse, heterogeneous data across these domains can lead to conflicts during model task transfer. In response to this challenge, our study introduces an Adaptive Semantic Space Learning (ASSL) framework, which utilizes the adaptive reorganization of data distributions within the semantic space to enhance the performance and selection efficacy of multi-expert models. Utilizing this framework, we trained a financial multi-task LLM named ""SilverSight"". Our research findings demonstrate that our framework can achieve results close to those obtained with full data training using only 10% of the data, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04949v1,2024-04
Unleashing Large Language Models' Proficiency in Zero-shot Essay Scoring,"Sanwoo Lee, Yida Cai, Desong Meng, Ziyang Wang, Yunfang Wu","Advances in automated essay scoring (AES) have traditionally relied on labeled essays, requiring tremendous cost and expertise for their acquisition. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in various tasks, but their potential is less explored in AES. In this paper, we show that our zero-shot prompting framework, Multi Trait Specialization (MTS), elicits LLMs' ample potential for essay scoring. In particular, we automatically decompose writing proficiency into distinct traits and generate scoring criteria for each trait. Then, an LLM is prompted to extract trait scores from several conversational rounds, each round scoring one of the traits based on the scoring criteria. Finally, we derive the overall score via trait averaging and min-max scaling. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTS consistently outperforms straightforward prompting (Vanilla) in average QWK across all LLMs and datasets, with maximum gains of 0.437 on TOEFL11 and 0.355 on ASAP. Additionally, with the help of MTS, the small-sized Llama2-13b-chat substantially outperforms ChatGPT, facilitating an effective deployment in real applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04941v2,2024-04
Towards Understanding the Influence of Reward Margin on Preference Model Performance,"Bowen Qin, Duanyu Feng, Xi Yang","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used framework for the training of language models. However, the process of using RLHF to develop a language model that is well-aligned presents challenges, especially when it comes to optimizing the reward model. Our research has found that existing reward models, when trained using the traditional ranking objective based on human preference data, often struggle to effectively distinguish between responses that are more or less favorable in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel method to estimate the preference differences without the need for detailed, exhaustive labels from human annotators. Our experimental results provide empirical evidence that incorporating margin values into the training process significantly improves the effectiveness of reward models. This comparative analysis not only demonstrates the superiority of our approach in terms of reward prediction accuracy but also highlights its effectiveness in practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04932v1,2024-04

Your Finetuned Large Language Model is Already a Powerful Out-of-distribution Detector,"Andi Zhang, Tim Z. Xiao, Weiyang Liu, Robert Bamler, Damon Wischik","We revisit the likelihood ratio between a pretrained large language model (LLM) and its finetuned variant as a criterion for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. The intuition behind such a criterion is that, the pretrained LLM has the prior knowledge about OOD data due to its large amount of training data, and once finetuned with the in-distribution data, the LLM has sufficient knowledge to distinguish their difference. Leveraging the power of LLMs, we show that, for the first time, the likelihood ratio can serve as an effective OOD detector. Moreover, we apply the proposed LLM-based likelihood ratio to detect OOD questions in question-answering (QA) systems, which can be used to improve the performance of specialized LLMs for general questions. Given that likelihood can be easily obtained by the loss functions within contemporary neural network frameworks, it is straightforward to implement this approach in practice. Since both the pretrained LLMs and its various finetuned models are available, our proposed criterion can be effortlessly incorporated for OOD detection without the need for further training. We conduct comprehensive evaluation across on multiple settings, including far OOD, near OOD, spam detection, and QA scenarios, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08679v1,2024-04
Radial Networks: Dynamic Layer Routing for High-Performance Large Language Models,"Jordan Dotzel, Yash Akhauri, Ahmed S. AbouElhamayed, Carly Jiang, Mohamed Abdelfattah, Zhiru Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with strict memory, latency, and power demands. To meet these demands, various forms of dynamic sparsity have been proposed that reduce compute on an input-by-input basis. These methods improve over static methods by exploiting the variance across individual inputs, which has steadily grown with the exponential increase in training data. Yet, the increasing depth within modern models, currently with hundreds of layers, has opened opportunities for dynamic layer sparsity, which skips the computation for entire layers. In this work, we explore the practicality of layer sparsity by profiling residual connections and establish the relationship between model depth and layer sparsity. For example, the residual blocks in the OPT-66B model have a median contribution of 5% to its output. We then take advantage of this dynamic sparsity and propose Radial Networks, which perform token-level routing between layers guided by a trained router module. These networks can be used in a post-training distillation from sequential networks or trained from scratch to co-learn the router and layer weights. They enable scaling to larger model sizes by decoupling the number of layers from the dynamic depth of the network, and their design allows for layer reuse. By varying the compute token by token, they reduce the overall resources needed for generating entire sequences. Overall, this leads to larger capacity networks with significantly lower compute and serving costs for large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04900v1,2024-04

Ethos and Pathos in Online Group Discussions: Corpora for Polarisation Issues in Social Media,"Ewelina Gajewska, Katarzyna Budzynska, Barbara Konat, Marcin Koszowy, Konrad Kiljan, Maciej Uberna, He Zhang","Growing polarisation in society caught the attention of the scientific community as well as news media, which devote special issues to this phenomenon. At the same time, digitalisation of social interactions requires to revise concepts from social science regarding establishment of trust, which is a key feature of all human interactions, and group polarisation, as well as new computational tools to process large quantities of available data. Existing methods seem insufficient to tackle the problem fully, thus, we propose to approach the problem by investigating rhetorical strategies employed by individuals in polarising discussions online. To this end, we develop multi-topic and multi-platform corpora with manual annotation of appeals to ethos and pathos, two modes of persuasion in Aristotelian rhetoric. It can be employed for training language models to advance the study of communication strategies online on a large scale.

How Many Languages Make Good Multilingual Instruction Tuning? A Case Study on BLOOM,"Shaoxiong Ji, Pinzhen Chen","Instruction tuning a large language model with multiple languages can prepare it for multilingual downstream tasks. Nonetheless, it is yet to be determined whether having a handful of languages is sufficient, or whether the benefits increase with the inclusion of more. By fine-tuning large multilingual models on 1 to 52 languages, we present a case study on BLOOM to understand three pertinent factors affecting performance: the number of languages, language exposure, and similarity between training and test languages. Overall we found that 1) expanding language coverage in multilingual instruction tuning proves to be beneficial; 2) accuracy often significantly boots if the test language appears in the instruction mixture; 3) languages' genetic features correlate with cross-lingual transfer more than merely the number of language but different languages benefit to various degrees.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04850v2,2024-04
F-MALLOC: Feed-forward Memory Allocation for Continual Learning in Neural Machine Translation,"Junhong Wu, Yuchen Liu, Chengqing Zong","In the evolving landscape of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has yielded impressive results. However, the persistent challenge of Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) remains a hurdle. While previous work has introduced Continual Learning (CL) methods to address CF, these approaches grapple with the delicate balance between avoiding forgetting and maintaining system extensibility. To address this, we propose a CL method, named $\textbf{F-MALLOC}$ ($\textbf{F}$eed-forward $\textbf{M}$emory $\textbf{ALLOC}ation)$. F-MALLOC is inspired by recent insights highlighting that feed-forward layers emulate neural memories and encapsulate crucial translation knowledge. It decomposes feed-forward layers into discrete memory cells and allocates these memories to different tasks. By learning to allocate and safeguard these memories, our method effectively alleviates CF while ensuring robust extendability. Besides, we propose a comprehensive assessment protocol for multi-stage CL of NMT systems. Experiments conducted following this new protocol showcase the superior performance of F-MALLOC, evidenced by higher BLEU scores and almost zero forgetting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04846v2,2024-04

Our results show that semantic similarity achieves moderate accuracy and correlation scores in trial data, while the ensemble method offers insights into the complexities of hallucination detection but falls short of expectations.

Data Bias According to Bipol: Men are Naturally Right and It is the Role of Women to Follow Their Lead,"Irene Pagliai, Goya van Boven, Tosin Adewumi, Lama Alkhaled, Namrata Gurung, Isabella Södergren, Elisa Barney","We introduce new large labeled datasets on bias in 3 languages and show in experiments that bias exists in all 10 datasets of 5 languages evaluated, including benchmark datasets on the English GLUE/SuperGLUE leaderboards. The 3 new languages give a total of almost 6 million labeled samples and we benchmark on these datasets using SotA multilingual pretrained models: mT5 and mBERT. The challenge of social bias, based on prejudice, is ubiquitous, as recent events with AI and large language models (LLMs) have shown. Motivated by this challenge, we set out to estimate bias in multiple datasets. We compare some recent bias metrics and use bipol, which has explainability in the metric. We also confirm the unverified assumption that bias exists in toxic comments by randomly sampling 200 samples from a toxic dataset population using the confidence level of 95% and error margin of 7%. Thirty gold samples were randomly distributed in the 200 samples to secure the quality of the annotation.

DWE+: Dual-Way Matching Enhanced Framework for Multimodal Entity Linking,"Shezheng Song, Shasha Li, Shan Zhao, Xiaopeng Li, Chengyu Wang, Jie Yu, Jun Ma, Tianwei Yan, Bin Ji, Xiaoguang Mao","Multimodal entity linking (MEL) aims to utilize multimodal information (usually textual and visual information) to link ambiguous mentions to unambiguous entities in knowledge base. Current methods facing main issues: (1)treating the entire image as input may contain redundant information. (2)the insufficient utilization of entity-related information, such as attributes in images. (3)semantic inconsistency between the entity in knowledge base and its representation. To this end, we propose DWE+ for multimodal entity linking. DWE+ could capture finer semantics and dynamically maintain semantic consistency with entities. This is achieved by three aspects: (a)we introduce a method for extracting fine-grained image features by partitioning the image into multiple local objects. Then, hierarchical contrastive learning is used to further align semantics between coarse-grained information(text and image) and fine-grained (mention and visual objects). (b)we explore ways to extract visual attributes from images to enhance fusion feature such as facial features and identity. (c)we leverage Wikipedia and ChatGPT to capture the entity representation, achieving semantic enrichment from both static and dynamic perspectives, which better reflects the real-world entity semantics. Experiments on Wikimel, Richpedia, and Wikidiverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DWE+ in improving MEL performance. Specifically, we optimize these datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the enhanced datasets.

FRACTAL: Fine-Grained Scoring from Aggregate Text Labels,"Yukti Makhija, Priyanka Agrawal, Rishi Saket, Aravindan Raghuveer","Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly tuned to power complex generation tasks such as writing, fact-seeking, querying and reasoning. Traditionally, human or model feedback for evaluating and further tuning LLM performance has been provided at the response level, enabling faster and more cost-effective assessments. However, recent works (Amplayo et al. [2022], Wu et al. [2023]) indicate that sentence-level labels may provide more accurate and interpretable feedback for LLM optimization. In this work, we introduce methods to disaggregate response-level labels into sentence-level (pseudo-)labels. Our approach leverages multiple instance learning (MIL) and learning from label proportions (LLP) techniques in conjunction with prior information (e.g., document-sentence cosine similarity) to train a specialized model for sentence-level scoring. We also employ techniques which use model predictions to pseudo-label the train-set at the sentence-level for model training to further improve performance.   We conduct extensive evaluations of our methods across six datasets and four tasks: retrieval, question answering, summarization, and math reasoning. Our results demonstrate improved performance compared to multiple baselines across most of these tasks. Our work is the first to develop response-level feedback to sentence-level scoring techniques, leveraging sentence-level prior information, along with comprehensive evaluations on multiple tasks as well as end-to-end finetuning evaluation showing performance comparable to a model trained on fine-grained human annotated labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04817v1,2024-04
Low-Resource Machine Translation through Retrieval-Augmented LLM Prompting: A Study on the Mambai Language,"Raphaël Merx, Aso Mahmudi, Katrina Langford, Leo Alberto de Araujo, Ekaterina Vylomova","This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for translating English into Mambai, a low-resource Austronesian language spoken in Timor-Leste, with approximately 200,000 native speakers. Leveraging a novel corpus derived from a Mambai language manual and additional sentences translated by a native speaker, we examine the efficacy of few-shot LLM prompting for machine translation (MT) in this low-resource context. Our methodology involves the strategic selection of parallel sentences and dictionary entries for prompting, aiming to enhance translation accuracy, using open-source and proprietary LLMs (LlaMa 2 70b, Mixtral 8x7B, GPT-4). We find that including dictionary entries in prompts and a mix of sentences retrieved through TF-IDF and semantic embeddings significantly improves translation quality. However, our findings reveal stark disparities in translation performance across test sets, with BLEU scores reaching as high as 21.2 on materials from the language manual, in contrast to a maximum of 4.4 on a test set provided by a native speaker. These results underscore the importance of diverse and representative corpora in assessing MT for low-resource languages. Our research provides insights into few-shot LLM prompting for low-resource MT, and makes available an initial corpus for the Mambai language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04809v1,2024-04
SqueezeAttention: 2D Management of KV-Cache in LLM Inference via Layer-wise Optimal Budget,"Zihao Wang, Bin Cui, Shaoduo Gan","Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose SqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers into two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves around 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/hetailang/SqueezeAttention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04793v2,2024-04
PMG : Personalized Multimodal Generation with Large Language Models,"Xiaoteng Shen, Rui Zhang, Xiaoyan Zhao, Jieming Zhu, Xi Xiao","The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the capabilities of text comprehension and generation. Multi-modal generation attracts great attention from both the industry and academia, but there is little work on personalized generation, which has important applications such as recommender systems. This paper proposes the first method for personalized multimodal generation using LLMs, showcases its applications and validates its performance via an extensive experimental study on two datasets. The proposed method, Personalized Multimodal Generation (PMG for short) first converts user behaviors (e.g., clicks in recommender systems or conversations with a virtual assistant) into natural language to facilitate LLM understanding and extract user preference descriptions. Such user preferences are then fed into a generator, such as a multimodal LLM or diffusion model, to produce personalized content. To capture user preferences comprehensively and accurately, we propose to let the LLM output a combination of explicit keywords and implicit embeddings to represent user preferences. Then the combination of keywords and embeddings are used as prompts to condition the generator. We optimize a weighted sum of the accuracy and preference scores so that the generated content has a good balance between them. Compared to a baseline method without personalization, PMG has a significant improvement on personalization for up to 8% in terms of LPIPS while retaining the accuracy of generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08677v1,2024-04
A Multi-Level Framework for Accelerating Training Transformer Models,"Longwei Zou, Han Zhang, Yangdong Deng","The fast growing capabilities of large-scale deep learning models, such as Bert, GPT and ViT, are revolutionizing the landscape of NLP, CV and many other domains. Training such models, however, poses an unprecedented demand for computing power, which incurs exponentially increasing energy cost and carbon dioxide emissions. It is thus critical to develop efficient training solutions to reduce the training costs. Motivated by a set of key observations of inter- and intra-layer similarities among feature maps and attentions that can be identified from typical training processes, we propose a multi-level framework for training acceleration. Specifically, the framework is based on three basic operators, Coalescing, De-coalescing and Interpolation, which can be orchestrated to build a multi-level training framework. The framework consists of a V-cycle training process, which progressively down- and up-scales the model size and projects the parameters between adjacent levels of models via coalescing and de-coalescing. The key idea is that a smaller model that can be trained for fast convergence and the trained parameters provides high-qualities intermediate solutions for the next level larger network. The interpolation operator is designed to break the symmetry of neurons incurred by de-coalescing for better convergence performance. Our experiments on transformer-based language models (e.g. Bert, GPT) as well as a vision model (e.g. DeiT) prove that the proposed framework reduces the computational cost by about 20% on training BERT/GPT-Base models and up to 51.6% on training the BERT-Large model while preserving the performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07999v1,2024-04

However, these techniques have received limited attention in the context of low-resource language models, which are trained on even smaller amounts of data and under computational constraints, a scenario known as the ""low-resource double-bind."" This paper investigates the effectiveness of pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization on an exclusively low-resourced, small-data language model, AfriBERTa. Through a battery of experiments, we assess the effects of compression on performance across several metrics beyond accuracy. Our study provides evidence that compression techniques significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of small-data language models, confirming that the prevailing beliefs regarding the effects of compression on large, heavily parameterized models hold true for less-parameterized, small-data models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04759v1,2024-04
Multilingual Brain Surgeon: Large Language Models Can be Compressed Leaving No Language Behind,"Hongchuan Zeng, Hongshen Xu, Lu Chen, Kai Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era in Natural Language Processing, but their massive size demands effective compression techniques for practicality. Although numerous model compression techniques have been investigated, they typically rely on a calibration set that overlooks the multilingual context and results in significant accuracy degradation for low-resource languages. This paper introduces Multilingual Brain Surgeon (MBS), a novel calibration data sampling method for multilingual LLMs compression. MBS overcomes the English-centric limitations of existing methods by sampling calibration data from various languages proportionally to the language distribution of the model training datasets. Our experiments, conducted on the BLOOM multilingual LLM, demonstrate that MBS improves the performance of existing English-centric compression methods, especially for low-resource languages. We also uncover the dynamics of language interaction during compression, revealing that the larger the proportion of a language in the training set and the more similar the language is to the calibration language, the better performance the language retains after compression. In conclusion, MBS presents an innovative approach to compressing multilingual LLMs, addressing the performance disparities and improving the language inclusivity of existing compression techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04748v1,2024-04
MACM: Utilizing a Multi-Agent System for Condition Mining in Solving Complex Mathematical Problems,"Bin Lei, Yi Zhang, Shan Zuo, Ali Payani, Caiwen Ding","Recent advancements in large language models, such as GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing standard queries. Despite these advancements, their performance substantially declines in \textbf{advanced mathematical problems requiring complex, multi-step logical reasoning}. To enhance their inferential capabilities, current research has delved into \textit{prompting engineering}, exemplified by methodologies such as the Tree of Thought and Graph of Thought. Nonetheless, these existing approaches encounter two significant limitations. Firstly, their effectiveness in tackling complex mathematical problems is somewhat constrained. Secondly, the necessity to design distinct prompts for individual problems hampers their generalizability. In response to these limitations, this paper introduces the \textit{Multi-Agent System for conditional Mining} (\textbf{MACM}) prompting method. It not only resolves intricate mathematical problems but also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various mathematical contexts. With the assistance of MACM, the accuracy of GPT-4 Turbo on the most challenging level five mathematical problems in the MATH dataset increase from $\mathbf{54.68\%} \text{ to } \mathbf{76.73\%}$. The code is available in \url{https://github.com/bin123apple/MACM}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04735v2,2024-04
Navigating the Landscape of Hint Generation Research: From the Past to the Future,"Anubhav Jangra, Jamshid Mozafari, Adam Jatowt, Smaranda Muresan","Digital education has gained popularity in the last decade, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. With the improving capabilities of large language models to reason and communicate with users, envisioning intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that can facilitate self-learning is not very far-fetched. One integral component to fulfill this vision is the ability to give accurate and effective feedback via hints to scaffold the learning process. In this survey article, we present a comprehensive review of prior research on hint generation, aiming to bridge the gap between research in education and cognitive science, and research in AI and Natural Language Processing. Informed by our findings, we propose a formal definition of the hint generation task, and discuss the roadmap of building an effective hint generation system aligned with the formal definition, including open challenges, future directions and ethical considerations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04728v2,2024-04
PoLLMgraph: Unraveling Hallucinations in Large Language Models via State Transition Dynamics,"Derui Zhu, Dingfan Chen, Qing Li, Zongxiong Chen, Lei Ma, Jens Grossklags, Mario Fritz","Despite tremendous advancements in large language models (LLMs) over recent years, a notably urgent challenge for their practical deployment is the phenomenon of hallucination, where the model fabricates facts and produces non-factual statements. In response, we propose PoLLMgraph, a Polygraph for LLMs, as an effective model-based white-box detection and forecasting approach. PoLLMgraph distinctly differs from the large body of existing research that concentrates on addressing such challenges through black-box evaluations. In particular, we demonstrate that hallucination can be effectively detected by analyzing the LLM's internal state transition dynamics during generation via tractable probabilistic models. Experimental results on various open-source LLMs confirm the efficacy of PoLLMgraph, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin, evidenced by over 20% improvement in AUC-ROC on common benchmarking datasets like TruthfulQA. Our work paves a new way for model-based white-box analysis of LLMs, motivating the research community to further explore, understand, and refine the intricate dynamics of LLM behaviors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04722v1,2024-04
Multicalibration for Confidence Scoring in LLMs,"Gianluca Detommaso, Martin Bertran, Riccardo Fogliato, Aaron Roth","This paper proposes the use of ""multicalibration"" to yield interpretable and reliable confidence scores for outputs generated by large language models (LLMs). Multicalibration asks for calibration not just marginally, but simultaneously across various intersecting groupings of the data. We show how to form groupings for prompt/completion pairs that are correlated with the probability of correctness via two techniques: clustering within an embedding space, and ""self-annotation"" - querying the LLM by asking it various yes-or-no questions about the prompt. We also develop novel variants of multicalibration algorithms that offer performance improvements by reducing their tendency to overfit. Through systematic benchmarking across various question answering datasets and LLMs, we show how our techniques can yield confidence scores that provide substantial improvements in fine-grained measures of both calibration and accuracy compared to existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04689v1,2024-04
Order-Based Pre-training Strategies for Procedural Text Understanding,"Abhilash Nandy, Yash Kulkarni, Pawan Goyal, Niloy Ganguly","In this paper, we propose sequence-based pretraining methods to enhance procedural understanding in natural language processing. Procedural text, containing sequential instructions to accomplish a task, is difficult to understand due to the changing attributes of entities in the context. We focus on recipes, which are commonly represented as ordered instructions, and use this order as a supervision signal. Our work is one of the first to compare several 'order as-supervision' transformer pre-training methods, including Permutation Classification, Embedding Regression, and Skip-Clip, and shows that these methods give improved results compared to the baselines and SoTA LLMs on two downstream Entity-Tracking datasets: NPN-Cooking dataset in recipe domain and ProPara dataset in open domain. Our proposed methods address the non-trivial Entity Tracking Task that requires prediction of entity states across procedure steps, which requires understanding the order of steps. These methods show an improvement over the best baseline by 1.6% and 7-9% on NPN-Cooking and ProPara Datasets respectively across metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04676v1,2024-04
PhyloLM : Inferring the Phylogeny of Large Language Models and Predicting their Performances in Benchmarks,"Nicolas Yax, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Stefano Palminteri","This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metrics based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04671v3,2024-04
"Multilingual Pretraining and Instruction Tuning Improve Cross-Lingual Knowledge Alignment, But Only Shallowly","Changjiang Gao, Hongda Hu, Peng Hu, Jiajun Chen, Jixing Li, Shujian Huang","Despite their strong ability to retrieve knowledge in English, current large language models show imbalance abilities in different languages. Two approaches are proposed to address this, i.e., multilingual pretraining and multilingual instruction tuning. However, whether and how do such methods contribute to the cross-lingual knowledge alignment inside the models is unknown. In this paper, we propose CLiKA, a systematic framework to assess the cross-lingual knowledge alignment of LLMs in the Performance, Consistency and Conductivity levels, and explored the effect of multilingual pretraining and instruction tuning on the degree of alignment. Results show that: while both multilingual pretraining and instruction tuning are beneficial for cross-lingual knowledge alignment, the training strategy needs to be carefully designed. Namely, continued pretraining improves the alignment of the target language at the cost of other languages, while mixed pretraining affect other languages less. Also, the overall cross-lingual knowledge alignment, especially in the conductivity level, is unsatisfactory for all tested LLMs, and neither multilingual pretraining nor instruction tuning can substantially improve the cross-lingual knowledge conductivity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04659v1,2024-04
Binary Classifier Optimization for Large Language Model Alignment,"Seungjae Jung, Gunsoo Han, Daniel Wontae Nam, Kyoung-Woon On","Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences through preference optimization has been crucial but labor-intensive, necessitating for each prompt a comparison of both a chosen and a rejected text completion by evaluators. Recently, Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) has demonstrated that LLMs can be aligned using merely binary ""thumbs-up"" or ""thumbs-down"" signals on each prompt-completion pair. In this paper, we present theoretical foundations to explain the successful alignment achieved through these binary signals. Our analysis uncovers a new perspective: optimizing a binary classifier, whose logit is a reward, implicitly induces minimizing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss. In the process of this discovery, we identified two techniques for effective alignment: reward shift and underlying distribution matching. Consequently, we propose a new algorithm, \textit{Binary Classifier Optimization}, that integrates the techniques. We validate our methodology in two settings: first, on a paired preference dataset, where our method performs on par with DPO and KTO; and second, on binary signal datasets simulating real-world conditions with divergent underlying distributions between thumbs-up and thumbs-down data. Our model consistently demonstrates effective and robust alignment across two base LLMs and three different binary signal datasets, showcasing the strength of our approach to learning from binary feedback.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04656v1,2024-04
ALERT: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Assessing Large Language Models' Safety through Red Teaming,"Simone Tedeschi, Felix Friedrich, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting, Roberto Navigli, Huu Nguyen, Bo Li","When building Large Language Models (LLMs), it is paramount to bear safety in mind and protect them with guardrails. Indeed, LLMs should never generate content promoting or normalizing harmful, illegal, or unethical behavior that may contribute to harm to individuals or society. This principle applies to both normal and adversarial use. In response, we introduce ALERT, a large-scale benchmark to assess safety based on a novel fine-grained risk taxonomy. It is designed to evaluate the safety of LLMs through red teaming methodologies and consists of more than 45k instructions categorized using our novel taxonomy. By subjecting LLMs to adversarial testing scenarios, ALERT aims to identify vulnerabilities, inform improvements, and enhance the overall safety of the language models. Furthermore, the fine-grained taxonomy enables researchers to perform an in-depth evaluation that also helps one to assess the alignment with various policies. In our experiments, we extensively evaluate 10 popular open- and closed-source LLMs and demonstrate that many of them still struggle to attain reasonable levels of safety.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08676v3,2024-04
HyperTTS: Parameter Efficient Adaptation in Text to Speech using Hypernetworks,"Yingting Li, Rishabh Bhardwaj, Ambuj Mehrish, Bo Cheng, Soujanya Poria","Neural speech synthesis, or text-to-speech (TTS), aims to transform a signal from the text domain to the speech domain. While developing TTS architectures that train and test on the same set of speakers has seen significant improvements, out-of-domain speaker performance still faces enormous limitations. Domain adaptation on a new set of speakers can be achieved by fine-tuning the whole model for each new domain, thus making it parameter-inefficient. This problem can be solved by Adapters that provide a parameter-efficient alternative to domain adaptation. Although famous in NLP, speech synthesis has not seen much improvement from Adapters. In this work, we present HyperTTS, which comprises a small learnable network, ""hypernetwork"", that generates parameters of the Adapter blocks, allowing us to condition Adapters on speaker representations and making them dynamic. Extensive evaluations of two domain adaptation settings demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving state-of-the-art performance in the parameter-efficient regime. We also compare different variants of HyperTTS, comparing them with baselines in different studies. Promising results on the dynamic adaptation of adapter parameters using hypernetworks open up new avenues for domain-generic multi-speaker TTS systems.

Context versus Prior Knowledge in Language Models,"Kevin Du, Vésteinn Snæbjarnarson, Niklas Stoehr, Jennifer C. White, Aaron Schein, Ryan Cotterell","To answer a question, language models often need to integrate prior knowledge learned during pretraining and new information presented in context. We hypothesize that models perform this integration in a predictable way across different questions and contexts: models will rely more on prior knowledge for questions about entities (e.g., persons, places, etc.) that they are more familiar with due to higher exposure in the training corpus, and be more easily persuaded by some contexts than others. To formalize this problem, we propose two mutual information-based metrics to measure a model's dependency on a context and on its prior about an entity: first, the persuasion score of a given context represents how much a model depends on the context in its decision, and second, the susceptibility score of a given entity represents how much the model can be swayed away from its original answer distribution about an entity. We empirically test our metrics for their validity and reliability. Finally, we explore and find a relationship between the scores and the model's expected familiarity with an entity, and provide two use cases to illustrate their benefits.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04633v3,2024-04
On the Limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs): False Attribution,"Tosin Adewumi, Nudrat Habib, Lama Alkhaled, Elisa Barney","In this work, we provide insight into one important limitation of large language models (LLMs), i.e. false attribution, and introduce a new hallucination metric - Simple Hallucination Index (SHI). The task of automatic author attribution for relatively small chunks of text is an important NLP task but can be challenging. We empirically evaluate the power of 3 open SotA LLMs in zero-shot setting (LLaMA-2-13B, Mixtral 8x7B, and Gemma-7B), especially as human annotation can be costly. We collected the top 10 most popular books, according to Project Gutenberg, divided each one into equal chunks of 400 words, and asked each LLM to predict the author. We then randomly sampled 162 chunks for human evaluation from each of the annotated books, based on the error margin of 7% and a confidence level of 95% for the book with the most chunks (Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, having 922 chunks). The average results show that Mixtral 8x7B has the highest prediction accuracy, the lowest SHI, and a Pearson's correlation (r) of 0.737, 0.249, and -0.9996, respectively, followed by LLaMA-2-13B and Gemma-7B. However, Mixtral 8x7B suffers from high hallucinations for 3 books, rising as high as an SHI of 0.87 (in the range 0-1, where 1 is the worst). The strong negative correlation of accuracy and SHI, given by r, demonstrates the fidelity of the new hallucination metric, which is generalizable to other tasks. We publicly release the annotated chunks of data and our codes to aid the reproducibility and evaluation of other models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04631v1,2024-04
Towards Analyzing and Understanding the Limitations of DPO: A Theoretical Perspective,"Duanyu Feng, Bowen Qin, Chen Huang, Zheng Zhang, Wenqiang Lei","Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which derives reward signals directly from pairwise preference data, has shown its effectiveness on aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Despite its widespread use across various tasks, DPO has been criticized for its sensitivity to the SFT's effectiveness and its hindrance to the learning capacity towards human-preferred responses, leading to less satisfactory performance. To overcome those limitations, the theoretical understanding of DPO are indispensable but still lacking. To this end, we take a step towards theoretically analyzing and understanding the limitations of DPO. Specifically, we provide an analytical framework using the field theory to analyze the optimization process of DPO. By analyzing the gradient vector field of the DPO loss function, we find that the DPO loss function decreases the probability of producing human dispreferred data at a faster rate than it increases the probability of producing preferred data. This provides theoretical insights for understanding the limitations of DPO discovered in the related research experiments, thereby setting the foundation for its improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04626v1,2024-04
RecGPT: Generative Personalized Prompts for Sequential Recommendation via ChatGPT Training Paradigm,"Yabin Zhang, Wenhui Yu, Erhan Zhang, Xu Chen, Lantao Hu, Peng Jiang, Kun Gai","ChatGPT has achieved remarkable success in natural language understanding. Considering that recommendation is indeed a conversation between users and the system with items as words, which has similar underlying pattern with ChatGPT, we design a new chat framework in item index level for the recommendation task. Our novelty mainly contains three parts: model, training and inference. For the model part, we adopt Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) as the sequential recommendation model and design a user modular to capture personalized information. For the training part, we adopt the two-stage paradigm of ChatGPT, including pre-training and fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we train GPT model by auto-regression. In the fine-tuning stage, we train the model with prompts, which include both the newly-generated results from the model and the user's feedback. For the inference part, we predict several user interests as user representations in an autoregressive manner. For each interest vector, we recall several items with the highest similarity and merge the items recalled by all interest vectors into the final result. We conduct experiments with both offline public datasets and online A/B test to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08675v1,2024-04
TCAN: Text-oriented Cross Attention Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Ming Zhou, Weize Quan, Ziqi Zhou, Kai Wang, Tong Wang, Dong-Ming Yan","Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) endeavors to understand human sentiment by leveraging language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Despite the remarkable performance exhibited by previous MSA approaches, the presence of inherent multimodal heterogeneities poses a challenge, with the contribution of different modalities varying considerably. Past research predominantly focused on improving representation learning techniques and feature fusion strategies. However, many of these efforts overlooked the variation in semantic richness among different modalities, treating each modality uniformly. This approach may lead to underestimating the significance of strong modalities while overemphasizing the importance of weak ones. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a Text-oriented Cross-Attention Network (TCAN), emphasizing the predominant role of the text modality in MSA. Specifically, for each multimodal sample, by taking unaligned sequences of the three modalities as inputs, we initially allocate the extracted unimodal features into a visual-text and an acoustic-text pair. Subsequently, we implement self-attention on the text modality and apply text-queried cross-attention to the visual and acoustic modalities. To mitigate the influence of noise signals and redundant features, we incorporate a gated control mechanism into the framework. Additionally, we introduce unimodal joint learning to gain a deeper understanding of homogeneous emotional tendencies across diverse modalities through backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that TCAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MSA methods on two datasets (CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04545v1,2024-04
Soft-Prompting with Graph-of-Thought for Multi-modal Representation Learning,"Juncheng Yang, Zuchao Li, Shuai Xie, Wei Yu, Shijun Li, Bo Du","The chain-of-thought technique has been received well in multi-modal tasks. It is a step-by-step linear reasoning process that adjusts the length of the chain to improve the performance of generated prompts. However, human thought processes are predominantly non-linear, as they encompass multiple aspects simultaneously and employ dynamic adjustment and updating mechanisms. Therefore, we propose a novel Aggregation-Graph-of-Thought (AGoT) mechanism for soft-prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. The proposed AGoT models the human thought process not only as a chain but also models each step as a reasoning aggregation graph to cope with the overlooked multiple aspects of thinking in single-step reasoning. This turns the entire reasoning process into prompt aggregation and prompt flow operations. Experiments show that our multi-modal model enhanced with AGoT soft-prompting achieves good results in several tasks such as text-image retrieval, visual question answering, and image recognition. In addition, we demonstrate that it has good domain generalization performance due to better reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04538v1,2024-04
A Morphology-Based Investigation of Positional Encodings,"Poulami Ghosh, Shikhar Vashishth, Raj Dabre, Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Contemporary deep learning models effectively handle languages with diverse morphology despite not being directly integrated into them. Morphology and word order are closely linked, with the latter incorporated into transformer-based models through positional encodings. This prompts a fundamental inquiry: Is there a correlation between the morphological complexity of a language and the utilization of positional encoding in pre-trained language models? In pursuit of an answer, we present the first study addressing this question, encompassing 22 languages and 5 downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that the importance of positional encoding diminishes with increasing morphological complexity in languages. Our study motivates the need for a deeper understanding of positional encoding, augmenting them to better reflect the different languages under consideration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04530v2,2024-04

We propose a transformer-based speaker-centric model for the Emotion Flip Reasoning (EFR) task. We also introduce Probable Trigger Zone, a region of the conversation that is more likely to contain the utterances causing the emotion to flip.

Q-PEFT: Query-dependent Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning for Text Reranking with Large Language Models,"Zhiyuan Peng, Xuyang Wu, Qifan Wang, Sravanthi Rajanala, Yi Fang","Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been extensively utilized in Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the down-streaming tasks without the cost of fine-tuing the whole LLMs. Recent studies have shown how to effectively use PEFT for fine-tuning LLMs in ranking tasks with convincing performance; there are some limitations, including the learned prompt being fixed for different documents, overfitting to specific tasks, and low adaptation ability. In this paper, we introduce a query-dependent parameter efficient fine-tuning (Q-PEFT) approach for text reranking to leak the information of the true queries to LLMs and then make the generation of true queries from input documents much easier. Specifically, we utilize the query to extract the top-$k$ tokens from concatenated documents, serving as contextual clues. We further augment Q-PEFT by substituting the retrieval mechanism with a multi-head attention layer to achieve end-to-end training and cover all the tokens in the documents, guiding the LLMs to generate more document-specific synthetic queries, thereby further improving the reranking performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04522v2,2024-04
IITK at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Hierarchical Embeddings for Detection of Persuasion Techniques in Memes,"Shreenaga Chikoti, Shrey Mehta, Ashutosh Modi","Memes are one of the most popular types of content used in an online disinformation campaign. They are primarily effective on social media platforms since they can easily reach many users. Memes in a disinformation campaign achieve their goal of influencing the users through several rhetorical and psychological techniques, such as causal oversimplification, name-calling, and smear. The SemEval 2024 Task 4 \textit{Multilingual Detection of Persuasion Technique in Memes} on identifying such techniques in the memes is divided across three sub-tasks: ($\mathbf{1}$) Hierarchical multi-label classification using only textual content of the meme, ($\mathbf{2}$) Hierarchical multi-label classification using both, textual and visual content of the meme and ($\mathbf{3}$) Binary classification of whether the meme contains a persuasion technique or not using it's textual and visual content. This paper proposes an ensemble of Class Definition Prediction (CDP) and hyperbolic embeddings-based approaches for this task. We enhance meme classification accuracy and comprehensiveness by integrating HypEmo's hierarchical label embeddings (Chen et al., 2023) and a multi-task learning framework for emotion prediction. We achieve a hierarchical F1-score of 0.60, 0.67, and 0.48 on the respective sub-tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04520v1,2024-04
Large Language Model (LLM) AI text generation detection based on transformer deep learning algorithm,"Yuhong Mo, Hao Qin, Yushan Dong, Ziyi Zhu, Zhenglin Li","In this paper, a tool for detecting LLM AI text generation is developed based on the Transformer model, aiming to improve the accuracy of AI text generation detection and provide reference for subsequent research. Firstly the text is Unicode normalised, converted to lowercase form, characters other than non-alphabetic characters and punctuation marks are removed by regular expressions, spaces are added around punctuation marks, first and last spaces are removed, consecutive ellipses are replaced with single spaces and the text is connected using the specified delimiter. Next remove non-alphabetic characters and extra whitespace characters, replace multiple consecutive whitespace characters with a single space and again convert to lowercase form. The deep learning model combines layers such as LSTM, Transformer and CNN for text classification or sequence labelling tasks. The training and validation sets show that the model loss decreases from 0.127 to 0.005 and accuracy increases from 94.96 to 99.8, indicating that the model has good detection and classification ability for AI generated text. The test set confusion matrix and accuracy show that the model has 99% prediction accuracy for AI-generated text, with a precision of 0.99, a recall of 1, and an f1 score of 0.99, achieving a very high classification accuracy.

Goal-guided Generative Prompt Injection Attack on Large Language Models,"Chong Zhang, Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Chengzhi Liu, Haochen Xue, Xiaobo Jin","Current large language models (LLMs) provide a strong foundation for large-scale user-oriented natural language tasks. A large number of users can easily inject adversarial text or instructions through the user interface, thus causing LLMs model security challenges. Although there is currently a large amount of research on prompt injection attacks, most of these black-box attacks use heuristic strategies. It is unclear how these heuristic strategies relate to the success rate of attacks and thus effectively improve model robustness. To solve this problem, we redefine the goal of the attack: to maximize the KL divergence between the conditional probabilities of the clean text and the adversarial text. Furthermore, we prove that maximizing the KL divergence is equivalent to maximizing the Mahalanobis distance between the embedded representation $x$ and $x'$ of the clean text and the adversarial text when the conditional probability is a Gaussian distribution and gives a quantitative relationship on $x$ and $x'$. Then we designed a simple and effective goal-guided generative prompt injection strategy (G2PIA) to find an injection text that satisfies specific constraints to achieve the optimal attack effect approximately. It is particularly noteworthy that our attack method is a query-free black-box attack method with low computational cost. Experimental results on seven LLM models and four datasets show the effectiveness of our attack method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07234v4,2024-04
Language Models as Critical Thinking Tools: A Case Study of Philosophers,"Andre Ye, Jared Moore, Rose Novick, Amy X. Zhang","Current work in language models (LMs) helps us speed up or even skip thinking by accelerating and automating cognitive work. But can LMs help us with critical thinking -- thinking in deeper, more reflective ways which challenge assumptions, clarify ideas, and engineer new concepts? We treat philosophy as a case study in critical thinking, and interview 21 professional philosophers about how they engage in critical thinking and on their experiences with LMs. We find that philosophers do not find LMs to be useful because they lack a sense of selfhood (memory, beliefs, consistency) and initiative (curiosity, proactivity). We propose the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools to characterize this gap. Using the model, we formulate three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent. We hope that our work inspires LM researchers to further develop LMs as critical thinking tools and philosophers and other 'critical thinkers' to imagine intellectually substantive uses of LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04516v2,2024-04
Joint Visual and Text Prompting for Improved Object-Centric Perception with Multimodal Large Language Models,"Songtao Jiang, Yan Zhang, Chenyi Zhou, Yeying Jin, Yang Feng, Jian Wu, Zuozhu Liu","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4V and Gemini Pro face challenges in achieving human-level perception in Visual Question Answering (VQA), particularly in object-oriented perception tasks which demand fine-grained understanding of object identities, locations or attributes, as indicated by empirical findings. This is mainly due to their limited capability to effectively integrate complex visual cues with textual information and potential object hallucinations. In this paper, we present a novel approach, Joint Visual and Text Prompting (VTPrompt), that employs fine-grained visual information to enhance the capability of MLLMs in VQA, especially for object-oriented perception. VTPrompt merges visual and text prompts to extract key concepts from textual questions and employs a detection model to highlight relevant objects as visual prompts in images. The processed images alongside text prompts are subsequently fed into MLLMs to produce more accurate answers. Our experiments with GPT-4V and Gemini Pro, on three benchmarks, i.e., MME , MMB and POPE, demonstrate significant improvements. Particularly, our method led to a score improvement of up to 183.5 for GPT-4V on MME and enhanced MMB performance by 8.17\% for GPT-4V and 15.69\% for Gemini Pro.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04514v1,2024-04

IITK at SemEval-2024 Task 2: Exploring the Capabilities of LLMs for Safe Biomedical Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials,"Shreyasi Mandal, Ashutosh Modi","Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple domains, yet they are prone to shortcut learning and factual inconsistencies. This research investigates LLMs' robustness, consistency, and faithful reasoning when performing Natural Language Inference (NLI) on breast cancer Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) in the context of SemEval 2024 Task 2: Safe Biomedical Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials. We examine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their adeptness at logical problem-solving. A comparative analysis is conducted on pre-trained language models (PLMs), GPT-3.5, and Gemini Pro under zero-shot settings using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, integrating various reasoning chains. The evaluation yields an F1 score of 0.69, consistency of 0.71, and a faithfulness score of 0.90 on the test dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04510v1,2024-04
KazQAD: Kazakh Open-Domain Question Answering Dataset,"Rustem Yeshpanov, Pavel Efimov, Leonid Boytsov, Ardak Shalkarbayuli, Pavel Braslavski","We introduce KazQAD -- a Kazakh open-domain question answering (ODQA) dataset -- that can be used in both reading comprehension and full ODQA settings, as well as for information retrieval experiments. KazQAD contains just under 6,000 unique questions with extracted short answers and nearly 12,000 passage-level relevance judgements. We use a combination of machine translation, Wikipedia search, and in-house manual annotation to ensure annotation efficiency and data quality. The questions come from two sources: translated items from the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset (only for training) and the original Kazakh Unified National Testing (UNT) exam (for development and testing). The accompanying text corpus contains more than 800,000 passages from the Kazakh Wikipedia. As a supplementary dataset, we release around 61,000 question-passage-answer triples from the NQ dataset that have been machine-translated into Kazakh. We develop baseline retrievers and readers that achieve reasonable scores in retrieval (NDCG@10 = 0.389 MRR = 0.382), reading comprehension (EM = 38.5 F1 = 54.2), and full ODQA (EM = 17.8 F1 = 28.7) settings. Nevertheless, these results are substantially lower than state-of-the-art results for English QA collections, and we think that there should still be ample room for improvement. We also show that the current OpenAI's ChatGPTv3.5 is not able to answer KazQAD test questions in the closed-book setting with acceptable quality.

Length-Controlled AlpacaEval: A Simple Way to Debias Automatic Evaluators,"Yann Dubois, Balázs Galambosi, Percy Liang, Tatsunori B. Hashimoto","LLM-based auto-annotators have become a key component of the LLM development process due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human-based evaluation. However, these auto-annotators can introduce complex biases that are hard to remove. Even simple, known confounders such as preference for longer outputs remain in existing automated evaluation metrics. We propose a simple regression analysis approach for controlling biases in auto-evaluations. As a real case study, we focus on reducing the length bias of AlpacaEval, a fast and affordable benchmark for chat LLMs that uses LLMs to estimate response quality. Despite being highly correlated with human preferences, AlpacaEval is known to favor models that generate longer outputs. We introduce a length-controlled AlpacaEval that aims to answer the counterfactual question: ""What would the preference be if the model's and baseline's output had the same length?"". To achieve this, we first fit a generalized linear model to predict the biased output of interest (auto-annotator preferences) based on the mediators we want to control for (length difference) and other relevant features. We then obtain length-controlled preferences by predicting preferences while conditioning the GLM with a zero difference in lengths. Length-controlling not only improves the robustness of the metric to manipulations in model verbosity, we also find that it increases the Spearman correlation with LMSYS' Chatbot Arena from 0.94 to 0.98. We release the code and leaderboard at https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/ .",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04475v1,2024-04
Towards Realistic Few-Shot Relation Extraction: A New Meta Dataset and Evaluation,"Fahmida Alam, Md Asiful Islam, Robert Vacareanu, Mihai Surdeanu","We introduce a meta dataset for few-shot relation extraction, which includes two datasets derived from existing supervised relation extraction datasets NYT29 (Takanobu et al., 2019; Nayak and Ng, 2020) and WIKIDATA (Sorokin and Gurevych, 2017) as well as a few-shot form of the TACRED dataset (Sabo et al., 2021). Importantly, all these few-shot datasets were generated under realistic assumptions such as: the test relations are different from any relations a model might have seen before, limited training data, and a preponderance of candidate relation mentions that do not correspond to any of the relations of interest. Using this large resource, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of six recent few-shot relation extraction methods, and observe that no method comes out as a clear winner. Further, the overall performance on this task is low, indicating substantial need for future research. We release all versions of the data, i.e., both supervised and few-shot, for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04445v1,2024-04
Counting Like Transformers: Compiling Temporal Counting Logic Into Softmax Transformers,"Andy Yang, David Chiang","Deriving formal bounds on the expressivity of transformers, as well as studying transformers that are constructed to implement known algorithms, are both effective methods for better understanding the computational power of transformers. Towards both ends, we introduce the temporal counting logic $\textsf{K}_\text{t}$[#] alongside the RASP variant $\textsf{C-RASP}$. We show they are equivalent to each other, and that together they are the best-known lower bound on the formal expressivity of future-masked soft attention transformers with unbounded input size.

Effects of Different Prompts on the Quality of GPT-4 Responses to Dementia Care Questions,"Zhuochun Li, Bo Xie, Robin Hilsabeck, Alyssa Aguirre, Ning Zou, Zhimeng Luo, Daqing He","Evidence suggests that different prompts lead large language models (LLMs) to generate responses with varying quality. Yet, little is known about prompts' effects on response quality in healthcare domains. In this exploratory study, we address this gap, focusing on a specific healthcare domain: dementia caregiving. We first developed an innovative prompt template with three components: (1) system prompts (SPs) featuring 4 different roles; (2) an initialization prompt; and (3) task prompts (TPs) specifying different levels of details, totaling 12 prompt combinations. Next, we selected 3 social media posts containing complicated, real-world questions about dementia caregivers' challenges in 3 areas: memory loss and confusion, aggression, and driving. We then entered these posts into GPT-4, with our 12 prompts, to generate 12 responses per post, totaling 36 responses. We compared the word count of the 36 responses to explore potential differences in response length. Two experienced dementia care clinicians on our team assessed the response quality using a rating scale with 5 quality indicators: factual, interpretation, application, synthesis, and comprehensiveness (scoring range: 0-5; higher scores indicate higher quality).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08674v1,2024-04
Deciphering Political Entity Sentiment in News with Large Language Models: Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Strategies,"Alapan Kuila, Sudeshna Sarkar","Sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding public opinion, particularly in the political domain where the portrayal of entities in news articles influences public perception. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting entity-specific sentiment from political news articles. Leveraging zero-shot and few-shot strategies, we explore the capability of LLMs to discern sentiment towards political entities in news content. Employing a chain-of-thought (COT) approach augmented with rationale in few-shot in-context learning, we assess whether this method enhances sentiment prediction accuracy. Our evaluation on sentiment-labeled datasets demonstrates that LLMs, outperform fine-tuned BERT models in capturing entity-specific sentiment. We find that learning in-context significantly improves model performance, while the self-consistency mechanism enhances consistency in sentiment prediction. Despite the promising results, we observe inconsistencies in the effectiveness of the COT prompting method. Overall, our findings underscore the potential of LLMs in entity-centric sentiment analysis within the political news domain and highlight the importance of suitable prompting strategies and model architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04361v1,2024-04
Prompt Public Large Language Models to Synthesize Data for Private On-device Applications,"Shanshan Wu, Zheng Xu, Yanxiang Zhang, Yuanbo Zhang, Daniel Ramage","Pre-training on public data is an effective method to improve the performance for federated learning (FL) with differential privacy (DP). This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) trained on public data can improve the quality of pre-training data for the on-device language models trained with DP and FL. We carefully design LLM prompts to filter and transform existing public data, and generate new data to resemble the real user data distribution. The model pre-trained on our synthetic dataset achieves relative improvement of 19.0% and 22.8% in next word prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model pre-trained on a standard public dataset, when evaluated over the real user data in Gboard (Google Keyboard, a production mobile keyboard application). Furthermore, our method achieves evaluation accuracy better than or comparable to the baseline during the DP FL fine-tuning over millions of mobile devices, and our final model outperforms the baseline in production A/B testing. Our experiments demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in synthesizing data close to the private distribution even without accessing the private data, and also suggest future research directions to further reduce the distribution gap.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04360v2,2024-04
Assisting humans in complex comparisons: automated information comparison at scale,"Truman Yuen, Graham A. Watt, Yuri Lawryshyn","Generative Large Language Models enable efficient analytics across knowledge domains, rivalling human experts in information comparisons. However, the applications of LLMs for information comparisons face scalability challenges due to the difficulties in maintaining information across large contexts and overcoming model token limitations. To address these challenges, we developed the novel Abstractive Summarization & Criteria-driven Comparison Endpoint (ASC$^2$End) system to automate information comparison at scale. Our system employs Semantic Text Similarity comparisons for generating evidence-supported analyses. We utilize proven data-handling strategies such as abstractive summarization and retrieval augmented generation to overcome token limitations and retain relevant information during model inference. Prompts were designed using zero-shot strategies to contextualize information for improved model reasoning. We evaluated abstractive summarization using ROUGE scoring and assessed the generated comparison quality using survey responses. Models evaluated on the ASC$^2$End system show desirable results providing insights on the expected performance of the system. ASC$^2$End is a novel system and tool that enables accurate, automated information comparison at scale across knowledge domains, overcoming limitations in context length and retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04351v2,2024-04
Scope Ambiguities in Large Language Models,"Gaurav Kamath, Sebastian Schuster, Sowmya Vajjala, Siva Reddy","Sentences containing multiple semantic operators with overlapping scope often create ambiguities in interpretation, known as scope ambiguities. These ambiguities offer rich insights into the interaction between semantic structure and world knowledge in language processing. Despite this, there has been little research into how modern large language models treat them. In this paper, we investigate how different versions of certain autoregressive language models -- GPT-2, GPT-3/3.5, Llama 2 and GPT-4 -- treat scope ambiguous sentences, and compare this with human judgments. We introduce novel datasets that contain a joint total of almost 1,000 unique scope-ambiguous sentences, containing interactions between a range of semantic operators, and annotated for human judgments. Using these datasets, we find evidence that several models (i) are sensitive to the meaning ambiguity in these sentences, in a way that patterns well with human judgments, and (ii) can successfully identify human-preferred readings at a high level of accuracy (over 90% in some cases).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04332v1,2024-04
Hypothesis Generation with Large Language Models,"Yangqiaoyu Zhou, Haokun Liu, Tejes Srivastava, Hongyuan Mei, Chenhao Tan","Effective generation of novel hypotheses is instrumental to scientific progress. So far, researchers have been the main powerhouse behind hypothesis generation by painstaking data analysis and thinking (also known as the Eureka moment). In this paper, we examine the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate hypotheses. We focus on hypothesis generation based on data (i.e., labeled examples). To enable LLMs to handle arbitrarily long contexts, we generate initial hypotheses from a small number of examples and then update them iteratively to improve the quality of hypotheses. Inspired by multi-armed bandits, we design a reward function to inform the exploitation-exploration tradeoff in the update process. Our algorithm is able to generate hypotheses that enable much better predictive performance than few-shot prompting in classification tasks, improving accuracy by 31.7% on a synthetic dataset and by 13.9%, 3.3% and, 24.9% on three real-world datasets. We also outperform supervised learning by 12.8% and 11.2% on two challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, we find that the generated hypotheses not only corroborate human-verified theories but also uncover new insights for the tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04326v3,2024-04
Watermark-based Attribution of AI-Generated Content,"Zhengyuan Jiang, Moyang Guo, Yuepeng Hu, Neil Zhenqiang Gong","Several companies have deployed watermark-based detection to identify AI-generated content. However, attribution--the ability to trace back to the user of a generative AI (GenAI) service who created a given piece of AI-generated content--remains largely unexplored despite its growing importance. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting the first systematic study on watermark-based, user-level attribution of AI-generated content. Our key idea is to assign a unique watermark to each user of the GenAI service and embed this watermark into the AI-generated content created by that user. Attribution is then performed by identifying the user whose watermark best matches the one extracted from the given content. This approach, however, faces a key challenge: How should watermarks be selected for users to maximize attribution performance? To address the challenge, we first theoretically derive lower bounds on detection and attribution performance through rigorous probabilistic analysis for any given set of user watermarks. Then, we select watermarks for users to maximize these lower bounds, thereby optimizing detection and attribution performance. Our theoretical and empirical results show that watermark-based attribution inherits both the accuracy and (non-)robustness properties of the underlying watermark. Specifically, attribution remains highly accurate when the watermarked AI-generated content is either not post-processed or subjected to common post-processing such as JPEG compression, as well as black-box adversarial post-processing with limited query budgets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04254v3,2024-04
Who Evaluates the Evaluations? Objectively Scoring Text-to-Image Prompt Coherence Metrics with T2IScoreScore (TS2),"Michael Saxon, Fatima Jahara, Mahsa Khoshnoodi, Yujie Lu, Aditya Sharma, William Yang Wang","With advances in the quality of text-to-image (T2I) models has come interest in benchmarking their prompt faithfulness -- the semantic coherence of generated images to the prompts they were conditioned on. A variety of T2I faithfulness metrics have been proposed, leveraging advances in cross-modal embeddings and vision-language models (VLMs). However, these metrics are not rigorously compared and benchmarked, instead presented with correlation to human Likert scores over a set of easy-to-discriminate images against seemingly weak baselines.   We introduce T2IScoreScore, a curated set of semantic error graphs containing a prompt and a set of increasingly erroneous images. These allow us to rigorously judge whether a given prompt faithfulness metric can correctly order images with respect to their objective error count and significantly discriminate between different error nodes, using meta-metric scores derived from established statistical tests. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art VLM-based metrics (e.g., TIFA, DSG, LLMScore, VIEScore) we tested fail to significantly outperform simple (and supposedly worse) feature-based metrics like CLIPScore, particularly on a hard subset of naturally-occurring T2I model errors. TS2 will enable the development of better T2I prompt faithfulness metrics through more rigorous comparison of their conformity to expected orderings and separations under objective criteria.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04251v3,2024-04

In this paper, we present a novel approach for dense prediction of the physical properties of objects using a collection of images. Inspired by how humans reason about physics through vision, we leverage large language models to propose candidate materials for each object. We then construct a language-embedded point cloud and estimate the physical properties of each 3D point using a zero-shot kernel regression approach. Our method is accurate, annotation-free, and applicable to any object in the open world.

Cleared for Takeoff? Compositional & Conditional Reasoning may be the Achilles Heel to (Flight-Booking) Language Agents,"Harsh Kohli, Huan Sun","The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has seen them excel and frequently surpass human performance on standard benchmarks.

To this end, we choose to study compositional and conditional reasoning, two cornerstones of human cognition, and introduce GroundCocoa - a lexically diverse benchmark connecting these reasoning skills to the real-world problem of flight booking. Our task involves aligning detailed user preferences with available flight options presented in a multiple-choice format. Results indicate a significant disparity in performance among current state-of-the-art LLMs with even the best performing model, GPT-4 Turbo, not exceeding 67% accuracy despite advanced prompting techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04237v1,2024-04

However, this area still remains relatively underexplored in video and mobile gaming contexts. In this work, we present a novel method for overcoming this limitation by extending a long-range Transformer model from the natural language processing domain to player behavior data. We discuss specifics of behavior tracking in games and propose preprocessing and tokenization approaches by viewing in-game events in an analogous way to words in sentences, thus enabling learning player representations in a self-supervised manner in the absence of ground-truth annotations. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in fitting the distribution of behavior events by evaluating intrinsic language modeling metrics. Furthermore, we qualitatively analyze the emerging structure of the learned embedding space and show its value for generating insights into behavior patterns to inform downstream applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04234v3,2024-04
Benchmarking and Improving Compositional Generalization of Multi-aspect Controllable Text Generation,"Tianqi Zhong, Zhaoyi Li, Quan Wang, Linqi Song, Ying Wei, Defu Lian, Zhendong Mao","Compositional generalization, representing the model's ability to generate text with new attribute combinations obtained by recombining single attributes from the training data, is a crucial property for multi-aspect controllable text generation (MCTG) methods. Nonetheless, a comprehensive compositional generalization evaluation benchmark of MCTG is still lacking. We propose CompMCTG, a benchmark encompassing diverse multi-aspect labeled datasets and a crafted three-dimensional evaluation protocol, to holistically evaluate the compositional generalization of MCTG approaches. We observe that existing MCTG works generally confront a noticeable performance drop in compositional testing. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Meta-MCTG, a training framework incorporating meta-learning, where we enable models to learn how to generalize by simulating compositional generalization scenarios in the training phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Meta-MCTG through achieving obvious improvement (by at most 3.64%) for compositional testing performance in 94.4% cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04232v2,2024-04

Recently, retrieve-and-rank approach to BLI has achieved state of the art results on the task. However, the problem remains challenging in low-resource settings, due to the paucity of data. The task is complicated by factors such as lexical variation across languages.

Sentiment analysis and random forest to classify LLM versus human source applied to Scientific Texts,Javier J. Sanchez-Medina,"After the launch of ChatGPT v.4 there has been a global vivid discussion on the ability of this artificial intelligence powered platform and some other similar ones for the automatic production of all kinds of texts, including scientific and technical texts. This has triggered a reflection in many institutions on whether education and academic procedures should be adapted to the fact that in future many texts we read will not be written by humans (students, scholars, etc.), at least, not entirely. In this work it is proposed a new methodology to classify texts coming from an automatic text production engine or a human, based on Sentiment Analysis as a source for feature engineering independent variables and then train with them a Random Forest classification algorithm. Using four different sentiment lexicons, a number of new features where produced, and then fed to a machine learning random forest methodology, to train such a model.

Parameter Efficient Quasi-Orthogonal Fine-Tuning via Givens Rotation,"Xinyu Ma, Xu Chu, Zhibang Yang, Yang Lin, Xin Gao, Junfeng Zhao","With the increasingly powerful performances and enormous scales of pretrained models, promoting parameter efficiency in fine-tuning has become a crucial need for effective and efficient adaptation to various downstream tasks. One representative line of fine-tuning methods is Orthogonal Fine-tuning (OFT), which rigorously preserves the angular distances within the parameter space to preserve the pretrained knowledge. Despite the empirical effectiveness, OFT still suffers low parameter efficiency at $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ and limited capability of downstream adaptation. Inspired by Givens rotation, in this paper, we proposed quasi-Givens Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (qGOFT) to address the problems. We first use $\mathcal{O}(d)$ Givens rotations to accomplish arbitrary orthogonal transformation in $SO(d)$ with provable equivalence, reducing parameter complexity from $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(d)$.

We examine positional biases at various stages of training for an encoder-decoder model, including language model pre-training, contrastive pre-training, and contrastive fine-tuning.

BEAR: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Relational Knowledge in Causal and Masked Language Models,"Jacek Wiland, Max Ploner, Alan Akbik","Knowledge probing assesses to which degree a language model (LM) has successfully learned relational knowledge during pre-training. Probing is an inexpensive way to compare LMs of different sizes and training configurations. However, previous approaches rely on the objective function used in pre-training LMs and are thus applicable only to masked or causal LMs. As a result, comparing different types of LMs becomes impossible. To address this, we propose an approach that uses an LM's inherent ability to estimate the log-likelihood of any given textual statement. We carefully design an evaluation dataset of 7,731 instances (40,916 in a larger variant) from which we produce alternative statements for each relational fact, one of which is correct. We then evaluate whether an LM correctly assigns the highest log-likelihood to the correct statement. Our experimental evaluation of 22 common LMs shows that our proposed framework, BEAR, can effectively probe for knowledge across different LM types. We release the BEAR datasets and an open-source framework that implements the probing approach to the research community to facilitate the evaluation and development of LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04113v1,2024-04
Large language models as oracles for instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge,"Giovanni Ciatto, Andrea Agiollo, Matteo Magnini, Andrea Omicini","Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes and properties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multiple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Experimentally, our approach achieves a quality metric that is up to five times higher than the state-of-the-art, while reducing erroneous entities and relations by up to ten times. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04108v2,2024-04

We identify the input problems that are responsible for many output errors and show that fixing these inputs reduces factual errors by between 52% and 76% (depending on the model). In addition, we observe that models struggle in processing tabular inputs that are structured in a non-standard way, particularly when the input lacks distinct row and column values or when the column headers are not correctly mapped to corresponding values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04103v1,2024-04
ROPO: Robust Preference Optimization for Large Language Models,"Xize Liang, Chao Chen, Shuang Qiu, Jie Wang, Yue Wu, Zhihang Fu, Zhihao Shi, Feng Wu, Jieping Ye","Preference alignment is pivotal for empowering large language models (LLMs) to generate helpful and harmless responses. However, the performance of preference alignment is highly sensitive to the prevalent noise in the preference data. Recent efforts for this problem either marginally alleviate the impact of noise without the ability to actually reduce its presence, or rely on costly teacher LLMs prone to reward misgeneralization. To address these challenges, we propose the RObust Preference Optimization (ROPO) framework, an iterative alignment approach that integrates noise-tolerance and filtering of noisy samples without the aid of external models. Specifically, ROPO iteratively solves a constrained optimization problem, where we dynamically assign a quality-aware weight for each sample and constrain the sum of the weights to the number of samples we intend to retain. For noise-tolerant training and effective noise identification, we derive a robust loss by suppressing the gradients of samples with high uncertainty. We demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that the derived loss is critical for distinguishing noisy samples from clean ones. Furthermore, inspired by our derived loss, we propose a robustness-guided rejection sampling technique to compensate for the potential important information in discarded queries. Experiments on three widely-used datasets with Mistral-7B and Llama-2-7B demonstrate that ROPO significantly outperforms existing preference alignment methods, with its superiority growing as the noise rate increases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04102v2,2024-04
Assessing the quality of information extraction,"Filip Seitl, Tomáš Kovářík, Soheyla Mirshahi, Jan Kryštůfek, Rastislav Dujava, Matúš Ondreička, Herbert Ullrich, Petr Gronat","Advances in large language models have notably enhanced the efficiency of information extraction from unstructured and semi-structured data sources. As these technologies become integral to various applications, establishing an objective measure for the quality of information extraction becomes imperative. However, the scarcity of labeled data presents significant challenges to this endeavor. In this paper, we introduce an automatic framework to assess the quality of the information extraction/retrieval and its completeness. The framework focuses on information extraction in the form of entity and its properties. We discuss how to handle the input/output size limitations of the large language models and analyze their performance when extracting the information. In particular, we introduce scores to evaluate the quality of the extraction and provide an extensive discussion on how to interpret them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04068v2,2024-04
Does Biomedical Training Lead to Better Medical Performance?,"Amin Dada, Marie Bauer, Amanda Butler Contreras, Osman Alperen Koraş, Constantin Marc Seibold, Kaleb E Smith, Jens Kleesiek","Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs aim to address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. Assessing the models' suitability for this sensitive application area is of the utmost importance. However, biomedical training has not been systematically evaluated on medical tasks. This study investigates the effect of biomedical training in the context of six practical medical tasks evaluating $25$ models. In contrast to previous evaluations, our results reveal a performance decline in nine out of twelve biomedical models after fine-tuning, particularly on tasks involving hallucinations, ICD10 coding, and instruction adherence. General-domain models like Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct outperformed their biomedical counterparts, indicating a trade-off between domain-specific fine-tuning and general medical task performance.

VoicePilot: Harnessing LLMs as Speech Interfaces for Physically Assistive Robots,"Akhil Padmanabha, Jessie Yuan, Janavi Gupta, Zulekha Karachiwalla, Carmel Majidi, Henny Admoni, Zackory Erickson","Physically assistive robots present an opportunity to significantly increase the well-being and independence of individuals with motor impairments or other forms of disability who are unable to complete activities of daily living. Speech interfaces, especially ones that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs), can enable individuals to effectively and naturally communicate high-level commands and nuanced preferences to robots. Frameworks for integrating LLMs as interfaces to robots for high level task planning and code generation have been proposed, but fail to incorporate human-centric considerations which are essential while developing assistive interfaces. In this work, we present a framework for incorporating LLMs as speech interfaces for physically assistive robots, constructed iteratively with 3 stages of testing involving a feeding robot, culminating in an evaluation with 11 older adults at an independent living facility. We use both quantitative and qualitative data from the final study to validate our framework and additionally provide design guidelines for using LLMs as speech interfaces for assistive robots.

Teaching Llama a New Language Through Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer,"Hele-Andra Kuulmets, Taido Purason, Agnes Luhtaru, Mark Fishel","This paper explores cost-efficient methods to adapt pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to new lower-resource languages, with a specific focus on Estonian.

A Dataset for Physical and Abstract Plausibility and Sources of Human Disagreement,"Annerose Eichel, Sabine Schulte im Walde","We present a novel dataset for physical and abstract plausibility of events in English. Based on naturally occurring sentences extracted from Wikipedia, we infiltrate degrees of abstractness, and automatically generate perturbed pseudo-implausible events. We annotate a filtered and balanced subset for plausibility using crowd-sourcing, and perform extensive cleansing to ensure annotation quality. In-depth quantitative analyses indicate that annotators favor plausibility over implausibility and disagree more on implausible events. Furthermore, our plausibility dataset is the first to capture abstractness in events to the same extent as concreteness, and we find that event abstractness has an impact on plausibility ratings: more concrete event participants trigger a perception of implausibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04035v1,2024-04

Prevalent in news, social media, and political discourse, PNCs are hypothesized to exhibit an evaluative function that is reflected in a more positive or negative perception as compared to the respective personal full name (such as Angela Merkel). We model 321 PNCs and their corresponding full names at discourse level, and show that PNCs bear an evaluative nature that can be captured through a variety of computational methods. Specifically, we assess through valence information whether a PNC is more positively or negatively evaluative than the person's name, by applying and comparing two approaches using (i) valence norms and (ii) pretrained language models (PLMs). We further enrich our data with personal, domain-specific, and extra-linguistic information and perform a range of regression analyses revealing that factors including compound and modifier valence, domain, and political party membership influence how a PNC is evaluated.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04031v1,2024-04
Good Books are Complex Matters: Gauging Complexity Profiles Across Diverse Categories of Perceived Literary Quality,"Yuri Bizzoni, Pascale Feldkamp, Ida Marie Lassen, Mia Jacobsen, Mads Rosendahl Thomsen, Kristoffer Nielbo","In this study, we employ a classification approach to show that different categories of literary ""quality"" display unique linguistic profiles, leveraging a corpus that encompasses titles from the Norton Anthology, Penguin Classics series, and the Open Syllabus project, contrasted against contemporary bestsellers, Nobel prize winners and recipients of prestigious literary awards. Our analysis reveals that canonical and so called high-brow texts exhibit distinct textual features when compared to other quality categories such as bestsellers and popular titles as well as to control groups, likely responding to distinct (but not mutually exclusive) models of quality. We apply a classic machine learning approach, namely Random Forest, to distinguish quality novels from ""control groups"", achieving up to 77\% F1 scores in differentiating between the categories. We find that quality category tend to be easier to distinguish from control groups than from other quality categories, suggesting than literary quality features might be distinguishable but shared through quality proxies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04022v2,2024-04

Several datasets exist for research on specific tasks of VRDU such as document classification (DC), key entity extraction (KEE), entity linking, visual question answering (VQA), inter alia. These datasets cover documents like invoices and receipts with sparse annotations such that they support one or two co-related tasks (e.g., entity extraction and entity linking). Unfortunately, only focusing on a single specific of documents or task is not representative of how documents often need to be processed in the wild - where variety in style and requirements is expected.

Investigating the Robustness of Modelling Decisions for Few-Shot Cross-Topic Stance Detection: A Preregistered Study,"Myrthe Reuver, Suzan Verberne, Antske Fokkens","For a viewpoint-diverse news recommender, identifying whether two news articles express the same viewpoint is essential. One way to determine ""same or different"" viewpoint is stance detection. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of operationalization choices for few-shot stance detection, with special attention to modelling stance across different topics. Our experiments test pre-registered hypotheses on stance detection. Specifically, we compare two stance task definitions (Pro/Con versus Same Side Stance), two LLM architectures (bi-encoding versus cross-encoding), and adding Natural Language Inference knowledge, with pre-trained RoBERTa models trained with shots of 100 examples from 7 different stance detection datasets. Some of our hypotheses and claims from earlier work can be confirmed, while others give more inconsistent results. The effect of the Same Side Stance definition on performance differs per dataset and is influenced by other modelling choices. We found no relationship between the number of training topics in the training shots and performance. In general, cross-encoding out-performs bi-encoding, and adding NLI training to our models gives considerable improvement, but these results are not consistent across all datasets. Our results indicate that it is essential to include multiple datasets and systematic modelling experiments when aiming to find robust modelling choices for the concept `stance'.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03987v1,2024-04

AuditGPT: Auditing Smart Contracts with ChatGPT,"Shihao Xia, Shuai Shao, Mengting He, Tingting Yu, Linhai Song, Yiying Zhang","To govern smart contracts running on Ethereum, multiple Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards have been developed, each containing a set of rules to guide the behaviors of smart contracts. Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. Today's practices of such verification are to either manually audit each single contract or use expert-developed, limited-scope program-analysis tools, both of which are far from being effective in identifying ERC rule violations. This paper presents a tool named AuditGPT that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically and comprehensively verify ERC rules against smart contracts. To build AuditGPT, we first conduct an empirical study on 222 ERC rules specified in four popular ERCs to understand their content, their security impacts, their specification in natural language, and their implementation in Solidity. Guided by the study, we construct AuditGPT by separating the large, complex auditing process into small, manageable tasks and design prompts specialized for each ERC rule type to enhance LLMs' auditing performance. In the evaluation, AuditGPT successfully pinpoints 418 ERC rule violations and only reports 18 false positives, showcasing its effectiveness and accuracy. Moreover, AuditGPT beats an auditing service provided by security experts in effectiveness, accuracy, and cost, demonstrating its advancement over state-of-the-art smart-contract auditing practices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04306v1,2024-04
Simple Techniques for Enhancing Sentence Embeddings in Generative Language Models,"Bowen Zhang, Kehua Chang, Chunping Li","Sentence Embedding stands as a fundamental task within the realm of Natural Language Processing, finding extensive application in search engines, expert systems, and question-and-answer platforms. With the continuous evolution of large language models such as LLaMA and Mistral, research on sentence embedding has recently achieved notable breakthroughs. However, these advancements mainly pertain to fine-tuning scenarios, leaving explorations into computationally efficient direct inference methods for sentence representation in a nascent stage. This paper endeavors to bridge this research gap. Through comprehensive experimentation, we challenge the widely held belief in the necessity of an Explicit One-word Limitation for deriving sentence embeddings from Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). We demonstrate that this approach, while beneficial for generative models under direct inference scenario, is not imperative for discriminative models or the fine-tuning of generative PLMs. This discovery sheds new light on the design of manual templates in future studies. Building upon this insight, we propose two innovative prompt engineering techniques capable of further enhancing the expressive power of PLMs' raw embeddings: Pretended Chain of Thought and Knowledge Enhancement. We confirm their effectiveness across various PLM types and provide a detailed exploration of the underlying factors contributing to their success.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03921v2,2024-04
"Forget NLI, Use a Dictionary: Zero-Shot Topic Classification for Low-Resource Languages with Application to Luxembourgish","Fred Philippy, Shohreh Haddadan, Siwen Guo","In NLP, zero-shot classification (ZSC) is the task of assigning labels to textual data without any labeled examples for the target classes. A common method for ZSC is to fine-tune a language model on a Natural Language Inference (NLI) dataset and then use it to infer the entailment between the input document and the target labels. However, this approach faces certain challenges, particularly for languages with limited resources. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution that leverages dictionaries as a source of data for ZSC. We focus on Luxembourgish, a low-resource language spoken in Luxembourg, and construct two new topic relevance classification datasets based on a dictionary that provides various synonyms, word translations and example sentences. We evaluate the usability of our dataset and compare it with the NLI-based approach on two topic classification tasks in a zero-shot manner. Our results show that by using the dictionary-based dataset, the trained models outperform the ones following the NLI-based approach for ZSC. While we focus on a single low-resource language in this study, we believe that the efficacy of our approach can also transfer to other languages where such a dictionary is available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03912v1,2024-04

SAAS: Solving Ability Amplification Strategy for Enhanced Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Hyeonwoo Kim, Gyoungjin Gim, Yungi Kim, Jihoo Kim, Byungju Kim, Wonseok Lee, Chanjun Park","This study presents a novel learning approach designed to enhance both mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Thus, the initial learning with CoT is essential for solving challenging mathematical problems. To this end, we propose a sequential learning approach, named SAAS (Solving Ability Amplification Strategy), which strategically transitions from CoT learning to PoT learning.

A Bi-consolidating Model for Joint Relational Triple Extraction,"Xiaocheng Luo, Yanping Chen, Ruixue Tang, Caiwei Yang, Ruizhang Huang, Yongbin Qin","Current methods to extract relational triples directly make a prediction based on a possible entity pair in a raw sentence without depending on entity recognition. The task suffers from a serious semantic overlapping problem, in which several relation triples may share one or two entities in a sentence. In this paper, based on a two-dimensional sentence representation, a bi-consolidating model is proposed to address this problem by simultaneously reinforcing the local and global semantic features relevant to a relation triple. This model consists of a local consolidation component and a global consolidation component. The first component uses a pixel difference convolution to enhance semantic information of a possible triple representation from adjacent regions and mitigate noise in neighbouring neighbours. The second component strengthens the triple representation based a channel attention and a spatial attention, which has the advantage to learn remote semantic dependencies in a sentence. They are helpful to improve the performance of both entity identification and relation type classification in relation triple extraction. After evaluated on several publish datasets, the bi-consolidating model achieves competitive performance. Analytical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for relational triple extraction and give motivation for other natural language processing tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03881v5,2024-04
"Extract, Define, Canonicalize: An LLM-based Framework for Knowledge Graph Construction","Bowen Zhang, Harold Soh","In this work, we are interested in automated methods for knowledge graph creation (KGC) from input text. Progress on large language models (LLMs) has prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A principal issue is that, in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schemas easily exceed the LLMs' context window length. Furthermore, there are scenarios where a fixed pre-defined schema is not available and we would like the method to construct a high-quality KG with a succinct self-generated schema. To address these problems, we propose a three-phase framework named Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information extraction followed by schema definition and post-hoc canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can be applied to settings where a pre-defined target schema is available and when it is not; in the latter case, it constructs a schema automatically and applies self-canonicalization. To further improve performance, we introduce a trained component that retrieves schema elements relevant to the input text; this improves the LLMs' extraction performance in a retrieval-augmented generation-like manner. We demonstrate on three KGC benchmarks that EDC is able to extract high-quality triplets without any parameter tuning and with significantly larger schemas compared to prior works. Code for EDC is available at https://github.com/clear-nus/edc.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03868v2,2024-04
FFN-SkipLLM: A Hidden Gem for Autoregressive Decoding with Adaptive Feed Forward Skipping,"Ajay Jaiswal, Bodun Hu, Lu Yin, Yeonju Ro, Shiwei Liu, Tianlong Chen, Aditya Akella","Autoregressive Large Language Models (e.g., LLaMa, GPTs) are omnipresent achieving remarkable success in language understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges for autoregressive token-by-token generation. To mitigate computation overload incurred during generation, several early-exit and layer-dropping strategies have been proposed. Despite some promising success due to the redundancy across LLMs layers on metrics like Rough-L/BLUE, our careful knowledge-intensive evaluation unveils issues such as generation collapse, hallucination of wrong facts, and noticeable performance drop even at the trivial exit ratio of 10-15% of layers. We attribute these errors primarily to ineffective handling of the KV cache through state copying during early-exit. In this work, we observed the saturation of computationally expensive feed-forward blocks of LLM layers and proposed FFN-SkipLLM, which is a novel fine-grained skip strategy of autoregressive LLMs. More specifically, FFN-SkipLLM is an input-adaptive feed-forward skipping strategy that can skip 25-30% of FFN blocks of LLMs with marginal change in performance on knowledge-intensive generation tasks without any requirement to handle KV cache. Our extensive experiments and ablation across benchmarks like MT-Bench, Factoid-QA, and variable-length text summarization illustrate how our simple and ease-at-use method can facilitate faster autoregressive decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03865v1,2024-04
Verifiable by Design: Aligning Language Models to Quote from Pre-Training Data,"Jingyu Zhang, Marc Marone, Tianjian Li, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi","To trust the fluent generations of large language models (LLMs), humans must be able to verify their correctness against trusted, external sources. Recent efforts, such as providing citations via retrieved documents or post-hoc provenance, enhance verifiability but provide no guarantees on their correctness. To address these limitations, we tackle the verifiability goal with a different philosophy: trivializing the verification process by developing models that quote verbatim statements from trusted sources in their pre-training data. We propose Quote-Tuning, which demonstrates the feasibility of aligning models to quote. The core of Quote-Tuning is a fast membership inference function that efficiently verifies text against trusted corpora. We leverage this tool to design a reward function to quantify quotes in model responses, and curate datasets for preference learning. Experiments show that Quote-Tuning significantly increases verbatim quotes from high-quality documents by up to 130% relative to base models while maintaining response quality. Quote-Tuning is applicable in different tasks, generalizes to out-of-domain data and diverse model families, and provides additional benefits to truthfulness. Our method not only serves as a hassle-free method to increase quoting but also opens up avenues for improving LLM trustworthiness through better verifiability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03862v3,2024-04
Distributionally Robust Alignment for Medical Federated Vision-Language Pre-training Under Data Heterogeneity,"Zitao Shuai, Chenwei Wu, Zhengxu Tang, Liyue Shen","Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has emerged as an effective scheme for multimodal representation learning, but its reliance on large-scale multimodal data poses significant challenges for medical applications. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution to scale up the dataset for medical VLP while preserving data privacy. However, we observe that client data heterogeneity in real-world scenarios could cause models to learn biased cross-modal alignment during local pre-training. This would limit the transferability of the federally learned representation model on downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Distributionally Robust Alignment (FedDRA), a framework for federated VLP that achieves robust vision-language alignment under heterogeneous conditions. Based on client datasets, we construct a distribution family that encompasses potential test-time domains, and apply a distributionally robust framework to optimize the pre-trained model's performance across this distribution space. This approach bridges the gap between pre-training samples and downstream applications. To avoid over-fitting on client-specific information, we use anchor representation from the global model to guide the local training, and adopt a two-stage approach to first tune deeper layers before updating the entire network. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDRA's effectiveness in enhancing medical federated VLP under data heterogeneity. Our method also adapts well to various medical pre-training methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03854v3,2024-04
An Investigation into Misuse of Java Security APIs by Large Language Models,"Zahra Mousavi, Chadni Islam, Kristen Moore, Alsharif Abuadbba, Muhammad Ali Babar","The increasing trend of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation raises the question of their capability to generate trustworthy code. While many researchers are exploring the utility of code generation for uncovering software vulnerabilities, one crucial but often overlooked aspect is the security Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs play an integral role in upholding software security, yet effectively integrating security APIs presents substantial challenges. This leads to inadvertent misuse by developers, thereby exposing software to vulnerabilities. To overcome these challenges, developers may seek assistance from LLMs. In this paper, we systematically assess ChatGPT's trustworthiness in code generation for security API use cases in Java. To conduct a thorough evaluation, we compile an extensive collection of 48 programming tasks for 5 widely used security APIs. We employ both automated and manual approaches to effectively detect security API misuse in the code generated by ChatGPT for these tasks. Our findings are concerning: around 70% of the code instances across 30 attempts per task contain security API misuse, with 20 distinct misuse types identified. Moreover, for roughly half of the tasks, this rate reaches 100%, indicating that there is a long way to go before developers can rely on ChatGPT to securely implement security API code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03823v1,2024-04
CantTalkAboutThis: Aligning Language Models to Stay on Topic in Dialogues,"Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Traian Rebedea, Shaona Ghosh, Jiaqi Zeng, Christopher Parisien","Recent advancements in instruction-tuning datasets have predominantly focused on specific tasks like mathematical or logical reasoning.

We introduce the CantTalkAboutThis dataset to help language models remain focused on the subject at hand during task-oriented interactions. It consists of synthetic dialogues on a wide range of conversation topics from different domains. These dialogues are interspersed with distractor turns that intentionally divert the chatbot from the predefined topic. Fine-tuning language models on this dataset helps make them resilient to deviating from the role assigned and improves their ability to maintain topical coherence compared to general-purpose instruction-tuned LLMs like GPT-4-turbo and Mixtral-Instruct.

PRobELM: Plausibility Ranking Evaluation for Language Models,"Zhangdie Yuan, Eric Chamoun, Rami Aly, Chenxi Whitehouse, Andreas Vlachos","This paper introduces PRobELM (Plausibility Ranking Evaluation for Language Models), a benchmark designed to assess language models' ability to discern more plausible from less plausible scenarios through their parametric knowledge. While benchmarks such as TruthfulQA emphasise factual accuracy or truthfulness, and others such as COPA explore plausible scenarios without explicitly incorporating world knowledge, PRobELM seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating models' capabilities to prioritise plausible scenarios that leverage world knowledge over less plausible alternatives. This design allows us to assess the potential of language models for downstream use cases such as literature-based discovery where the focus is on identifying information that is likely but not yet known. Our benchmark is constructed from a dataset curated from Wikidata edit histories, tailored to align the temporal bounds of the training data for the evaluated models. PRobELM facilitates the evaluation of language models across multiple prompting types, including statement, text completion, and question-answering. Experiments with 10 models of various sizes and architectures on the relationship between model scales, training recency, and plausibility performance, reveal that factual accuracy does not directly correlate with plausibility performance and that up-to-date training data enhances plausibility assessment across different model architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03818v2,2024-04

We highlight that Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) presents key opportunities to structure retrieval as part of the RAG process in an LLM. We introduce CBR-RAG, where CBR cycle's initial retrieval stage, its indexing vocabulary, and similarity knowledge containers are used to enhance LLM queries with contextually relevant cases. This integration augments the original LLM query, providing a richer prompt. We present an evaluation of CBR-RAG, and examine different representations (i.e. general and domain-specific embeddings) and methods of comparison (i.e. inter, intra and hybrid similarity) on the task of legal question-answering. Our results indicate that the context provided by CBR's case reuse enforces similarity between relevant components of the questions and the evidence base leading to significant improvements in the quality of generated answers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04302v1,2024-04
SELF-[IN]CORRECT: LLMs Struggle with Discriminating Self-Generated Responses,"Dongwei Jiang, Jingyu Zhang, Orion Weller, Nathaniel Weir, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi","Can LLMs consistently improve their previous outputs for better results? For this to be true, LLMs would need to be better at discriminating among previously-generated alternatives, than generating initial responses. We explore the validity of this hypothesis in practice. We first formulate a unified framework that allows us to compare the generative and discriminative capability of any model on any task. In our resulting experimental analysis of several open-source and industrial LLMs, we observe that models are not reliably better at discriminating among previously-generated alternatives than generating initial responses. This finding challenges the notion that LLMs may be able to enhance their performance only through their own judgment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04298v3,2024-04
GenQREnsemble: Zero-Shot LLM Ensemble Prompting for Generative Query Reformulation,"Kaustubh Dhole, Eugene Agichtein","Query Reformulation(QR) is a set of techniques used to transform a user's original search query to a text that better aligns with the user's intent and improves their search experience. Recently, zero-shot QR has been shown to be a promising approach due to its ability to exploit knowledge inherent in large language models. By taking inspiration from the success of ensemble prompting strategies which have benefited many tasks, we investigate if they can help improve query reformulation. In this context, we propose an ensemble based prompting technique, GenQREnsemble which leverages paraphrases of a zero-shot instruction to generate multiple sets of keywords ultimately improving retrieval performance. We further introduce its post-retrieval variant, GenQREnsembleRF to incorporate pseudo relevant feedback. On evaluations over four IR benchmarks, we find that GenQREnsemble generates better reformulations with relative nDCG@10 improvements up to 18% and MAP improvements upto 24% over the previous zero-shot state-of-art. On the MSMarco Passage Ranking task, GenQREnsembleRF shows relative gains of 5% MRR using pseudo-relevance feedback, and 9% nDCG@10 using relevant feedback documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03746v1,2024-04
Fakes of Varying Shades: How Warning Affects Human Perception and Engagement Regarding LLM Hallucinations,"Mahjabin Nahar, Haeseung Seo, Eun-Ju Lee, Aiping Xiong, Dongwon Lee","The widespread adoption and transformative effects of large language models (LLMs) have sparked concerns regarding their capacity to produce inaccurate and fictitious content, referred to as `hallucinations'. Given the potential risks associated with hallucinations, humans should be able to identify them. This research aims to understand the human perception of LLM hallucinations by systematically varying the degree of hallucination (genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination) and examining its interaction with warning (i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent vs. present). Participants (N=419) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content (e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format. Participants ranked content as truthful in the order of genuine, minor hallucination, and major hallucination, and user engagement behaviors mirrored this pattern. More importantly, we observed that warning improved the detection of hallucination without significantly affecting the perceived truthfulness of genuine content. We conclude by offering insights for future tools to aid human detection of hallucinations. All survey materials, demographic questions, and post-session questions are available at: https://github.com/MahjabinNahar/fakes-of-varying-shades-survey-materials",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03745v3,2024-04
SHROOM-INDElab at SemEval-2024 Task 6: Zero- and Few-Shot LLM-Based Classification for Hallucination Detection,"Bradley P. Allen, Fina Polat, Paul Groth","We describe the University of Amsterdam Intelligent Data Engineering Lab team's entry for the SemEval-2024 Task 6 competition. The SHROOM-INDElab system builds on previous work on using prompt programming and in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) to build classifiers for hallucination detection, and extends that work through the incorporation of context-specific definition of task, role, and target concept, and automated generation of examples for use in a few-shot prompting approach. The resulting system achieved fourth-best and sixth-best performance in the model-agnostic track and model-aware tracks for Task 6, respectively, and evaluation using the validation sets showed that the system's classification decisions were consistent with those of the crowd-sourced human labellers. We further found that a zero-shot approach provided better accuracy than a few-shot approach using automatically generated examples.

CoMat: Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Image-to-Text Concept Matching,"Dongzhi Jiang, Guanglu Song, Xiaoshi Wu, Renrui Zhang, Dazhong Shen, Zhuofan Zong, Yu Liu, Hongsheng Li","Diffusion models have demonstrated great success in the field of text-to-image generation. However, alleviating the misalignment between the text prompts and images is still challenging. The root reason behind the misalignment has not been extensively investigated. We observe that the misalignment is caused by inadequate token attention activation. We further attribute this phenomenon to the diffusion model's insufficient condition utilization, which is caused by its training paradigm. To address the issue, we propose CoMat, an end-to-end diffusion model fine-tuning strategy with an image-to-text concept matching mechanism. We leverage an image captioning model to measure image-to-text alignment and guide the diffusion model to revisit ignored tokens. A novel attribute concentration module is also proposed to address the attribute binding problem. Without any image or human preference data, we use only 20K text prompts to fine-tune SDXL to obtain CoMat-SDXL. Extensive experiments show that CoMat-SDXL significantly outperforms the baseline model SDXL in two text-to-image alignment benchmarks and achieves start-of-the-art performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03653v3,2024-04
AutoWebGLM: A Large Language Model-based Web Navigating Agent,"Hanyu Lai, Xiao Liu, Iat Long Iong, Shuntian Yao, Yuxuan Chen, Pengbo Shen, Hao Yu, Hanchen Zhang, Xiaohan Zhang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang","Large language models (LLMs) have fueled many intelligent web agents, but most existing ones perform far from satisfying in real-world web navigation tasks due to three factors: (1) the complexity of HTML text data (2) versatility of actions on webpages, and (3) task difficulty due to the open-domain nature of the web. In light of these challenges, we develop the open AutoWebGLM based on ChatGLM3-6B. AutoWebGLM can serve as a powerful automated web navigation agent that outperform GPT-4. Inspired by human browsing patterns, we first design an HTML simplification algorithm to represent webpages with vital information preserved succinctly. We then employ a hybrid human-AI method to build web browsing data for curriculum training. Finally, we bootstrap the model by reinforcement learning and rejection sampling to further facilitate webpage comprehension, browser operations, and efficient task decomposition by itself. For comprehensive evaluation, we establish a bilingual benchmark -- AutoWebBench -- for real-world web navigation tasks. We evaluate AutoWebGLM across diverse web navigation benchmarks, demonstrating its potential to tackle challenging tasks in real environments.

Locating and Editing Factual Associations in Mamba,"Arnab Sen Sharma, David Atkinson, David Bau","We investigate the mechanisms of factual recall in the Mamba state space model. Our work is inspired by previous findings in autoregressive transformer language models suggesting that their knowledge recall is localized to particular modules at specific token locations; we therefore ask whether factual recall in Mamba can be similarly localized. To investigate this, we conduct four lines of experiments on Mamba. First, we apply causal tracing or interchange interventions to localize key components inside Mamba that are responsible for recalling facts, revealing that specific components within middle layers show strong causal effects at the last token of the subject, while the causal effect of intervening on later layers is most pronounced at the last token of the prompt, matching previous findings on autoregressive transformers. Second, we show that rank-one model editing methods can successfully insert facts at specific locations, again resembling findings on transformer LMs. Third, we examine the linearity of Mamba's representations of factual relations. Finally we adapt attention-knockout techniques to Mamba in order to dissect information flow during factual recall. We compare Mamba directly to a similar-sized autoregressive transformer LM and conclude that despite significant differences in architectural approach, when it comes to factual recall, the two architectures share many similarities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03646v2,2024-04
"No ""Zero-Shot"" Without Exponential Data: Pretraining Concept Frequency Determines Multimodal Model Performance","Vishaal Udandarao, Ameya Prabhu, Adhiraj Ghosh, Yash Sharma, Philip H. S. Torr, Adel Bibi, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge","Web-crawled pretraining datasets underlie the impressive ""zero-shot"" evaluation performance of multimodal models, such as CLIP for classification/retrieval and Stable-Diffusion for image generation. However, it is unclear how meaningful the notion of ""zero-shot"" generalization is for such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during ""zero-shot"" evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts in their pretraining datasets? We comprehensively investigate this question across 34 models and five standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting ""zero-shot"" generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve linear improvements in downstream ""zero-shot"" performance, following a sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore, upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis, we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We contribute this long-tail test set as the ""Let it Wag!"" benchmark to further research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential need for training data which implies that the key to ""zero-shot"" generalization capabilities under large-scale training paradigms remains to be found.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04125v3,2024-04
Direct Nash Optimization: Teaching Language Models to Self-Improve with General Preferences,"Corby Rosset, Ching-An Cheng, Arindam Mitra, Michael Santacroce, Ahmed Awadallah, Tengyang Xie","This paper studies post-training large language models (LLMs) using preference feedback from a powerful oracle to help a model iteratively improve over itself. The typical approach for post-training LLMs involves Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which traditionally separates reward learning and subsequent policy optimization. However, such a reward maximization approach is limited by the nature of ""point-wise"" rewards (such as Bradley-Terry model), which fails to express complex intransitive or cyclic preference relations. While advances on RLHF show reward learning and policy optimization can be merged into a single contrastive objective for stability, they yet still remain tethered to the reward maximization framework. Recently, a new wave of research sidesteps the reward maximization presumptions in favor of directly optimizing over ""pair-wise"" or general preferences. In this paper, we introduce Direct Nash Optimization (DNO), a provable and scalable algorithm that marries the simplicity and stability of contrastive learning with theoretical generality from optimizing general preferences. Because DNO is a batched on-policy algorithm using a regression-based objective, its implementation is straightforward and efficient. Moreover, DNO enjoys monotonic improvement across iterations that help it improve even over a strong teacher (such as GPT-4). In our experiments, a resulting 7B parameter Orca-2.5 model aligned by DNO achieves the state-of-the-art win-rate against GPT-4-Turbo of 33% on AlpacaEval 2.0 (even after controlling for response length), an absolute gain of 26% (7% to 33%) over the initializing model. It outperforms models with far more parameters, including Mistral Large, Self-Rewarding LM (70B parameters), and older versions of GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03715v1,2024-04
WorDepth: Variational Language Prior for Monocular Depth Estimation,"Ziyao Zeng, Daniel Wang, Fengyu Yang, Hyoungseob Park, Yangchao Wu, Stefano Soatto, Byung-Woo Hong, Dong Lao, Alex Wong","Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single image is an ill-posed problem with inherent ambiguities, i.e. scale. Predicting a 3D scene from text description(s) is similarly ill-posed, i.e. spatial arrangements of objects described. We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous modalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions. To test this, we focus on monocular depth estimation, the problem of predicting a dense depth map from a single image, but with an additional text caption describing the scene. To this end, we begin by encoding the text caption as a mean and standard deviation; using a variational framework, we learn the distribution of the plausible metric reconstructions of 3D scenes corresponding to the text captions as a prior. To ""select"" a specific reconstruction or depth map, we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from the latent space of the variational text encoder, which is then decoded to the output depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and image branches: in one optimization step, we predict the mean and standard deviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian, and in the other, we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained, we directly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler. We demonstrate our approach on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios, where we show that language can consistently improve performance in both.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03635v4,2024-04
Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text,"Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, Alex Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant","In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\""ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03626v3,2024-04
Unveiling LLMs: The Evolution of Latent Representations in a Dynamic Knowledge Graph,"Marco Bronzini, Carlo Nicolini, Bruno Lepri, Jacopo Staiano, Andrea Passerini","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive capacity to recall a vast range of factual knowledge. However, understanding their underlying reasoning and internal mechanisms in exploiting this knowledge remains a key research area. This work unveils the factual information an LLM represents internally for sentence-level claim verification. We propose an end-to-end framework to decode factual knowledge embedded in token representations from a vector space to a set of ground predicates, showing its layer-wise evolution using a dynamic knowledge graph. Our framework employs activation patching, a vector-level technique that alters a token representation during inference, to extract encoded knowledge. Accordingly, we neither rely on training nor external models. Using factual and common-sense claims from two claim verification datasets, we showcase interpretability analyses at local and global levels. The local analysis highlights entity centrality in LLM reasoning, from claim-related information and multi-hop reasoning to representation errors causing erroneous evaluation. On the other hand, the global reveals trends in the underlying evolution, such as word-based knowledge evolving into claim-related facts. By interpreting semantics from LLM latent representations and enabling graph-related analyses, this work enhances the understanding of the factual knowledge resolution process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03623v2,2024-04
Mind's Eye of LLMs: Visualization-of-Thought Elicits Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Wenshan Wu, Shaoguang Mao, Yadong Zhang, Yan Xia, Li Dong, Lei Cui, Furu Wei","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance in language comprehension and various reasoning tasks. However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate mental images to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs. Please find the dataset and codes at https://microsoft.github.io/visualization-of-thought",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03622v3,2024-04
Sailor: Open Language Models for South-East Asia,"Longxu Dou, Qian Liu, Guangtao Zeng, Jia Guo, Jiahui Zhou, Wei Lu, Min Lin","We present Sailor, a family of open language models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters, tailored for South-East Asian (SEA) languages.

Mitigating the Impact of Outlier Channels for Language Model Quantization with Activation Regularization,"Aniruddha Nrusimha, Mayank Mishra, Naigang Wang, Dan Alistarh, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim","We consider the problem of accurate quantization for language models, where both the weights and activations are uniformly quantized to 4 bits per parameter, the lowest bitwidth format natively supported by GPU hardware. In this context, the key challenge is activation quantization: it is known that language models contain outlier channels whose values on average are orders of magnitude higher than than other channels, which prevents accurate low-bitwidth quantization with known techniques. We systematically study this phenomena and find that these outlier channels emerge early in training, and that they occur more frequently in layers with residual streams. We then propose a simple strategy which regularizes a layer's inputs via quantization-aware training (QAT) and its outputs via activation kurtosis regularization. We show that regularizing both the inputs and outputs is crucial for preventing a model's ""migrating"" the difficulty in input quantization to the weights, which makes post-training quantization (PTQ) of weights more difficult. When combined with weight PTQ, we show that our approach can obtain a W4A4 model that performs competitively to the standard-precision W16A16 baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03605v2,2024-04
Evaluating LLMs at Detecting Errors in LLM Responses,"Ryo Kamoi, Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Renze Lou, Jihyun Janice Ahn, Yilun Zhao, Xiaoxin Lu, Nan Zhang, Yusen Zhang, Ranran Haoran Zhang, Sujeeth Reddy Vummanthala, Salika Dave, Shaobo Qin, Arman Cohan, Wenpeng Yin, Rui Zhang","With Large Language Models (LLMs) being widely used across various tasks, detecting errors in their responses is increasingly crucial. However, little research has been conducted on error detection of LLM responses. Collecting error annotations on LLM responses is challenging due to the subjective nature of many NLP tasks, and thus previous research focuses on tasks of little practical value (e.g., word sorting) or limited error types (e.g., faithfulness in summarization). This work introduces ReaLMistake, the first error detection benchmark consisting of objective, realistic, and diverse errors made by LLMs. ReaLMistake contains three challenging and meaningful tasks that introduce objectively assessable errors in four categories (reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge), eliciting naturally observed and diverse errors in responses of GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B annotated by experts. We use ReaLMistake to evaluate error detectors based on 12 LLMs. Our findings show: 1) Top LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 detect errors made by LLMs at very low recall, and all LLM-based error detectors perform much worse than humans. 2) Explanations by LLM-based error detectors lack reliability. 3) LLMs-based error detection is sensitive to small changes in prompts but remains challenging to improve. 4) Popular approaches to improving LLMs, including self-consistency and majority vote, do not improve the error detection performance.

Despite recent research on large-language models (LLMs) motivated by endeavours to attain generalized intelligence, their efficacy in replacing task and domain-specific natural language understanding approaches remains questionable. In this paper, we address this question by conducting a comprehensive empirical evaluation of intent detection and named entity recognition (NER) tasks from biomedical text. We show that Supervised Fine Tuned approaches are still relevant and more effective than general-purpose LLMs. Biomedical transformer models such as PubMedBERT can surpass ChatGPT on NER task with only 5 supervised examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03598v2,2024-04
Transducers with Pronunciation-aware Embeddings for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Hainan Xu, Zhehuai Chen, Fei Jia, Boris Ginsburg","This paper proposes Transducers with Pronunciation-aware Embeddings (PET). Unlike conventional Transducers where the decoder embeddings for different tokens are trained independently, the PET model's decoder embedding incorporates shared components for text tokens with the same or similar pronunciations. With experiments conducted in multiple datasets in Mandarin Chinese and Korean, we show that PET models consistently improve speech recognition accuracy compared to conventional Transducers. Our investigation also uncovers a phenomenon that we call error chain reactions. Instead of recognition errors being evenly spread throughout an utterance, they tend to group together, with subsequent errors often following earlier ones. Our analysis shows that PET models effectively mitigate this issue by substantially reducing the likelihood of the model generating additional errors following a prior one. Our implementation will be open-sourced with the NeMo toolkit.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04295v1,2024-04
ReFT: Representation Finetuning for Language Models,"Zhengxuan Wu, Aryaman Arora, Zheng Wang, Atticus Geiger, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning, Christopher Potts","Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods seek to adapt large neural models via updates to a small number of weights. However, much prior interpretability work has shown that representations encode rich semantic information, suggesting that editing representations might be a more powerful alternative. We pursue this hypothesis by developing a family of Representation Finetuning (ReFT) methods. ReFT methods operate on a frozen base model and learn task-specific interventions on hidden representations. We define a strong instance of the ReFT family, Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT), and we identify an ablation of this method that trades some performance for increased efficiency. Both are drop-in replacements for existing PEFTs and learn interventions that are 15x--65x more parameter-efficient than LoRA. We showcase LoReFT on eight commonsense reasoning tasks, four arithmetic reasoning tasks, instruction-tuning, and GLUE. In all these evaluations, our ReFTs deliver the best balance of efficiency and performance, and almost always outperform state-of-the-art PEFTs.

Untangle the KNOT: Interweaving Conflicting Knowledge and Reasoning Skills in Large Language Models,"Yantao Liu, Zijun Yao, Xin Lv, Yuchen Fan, Shulin Cao, Jifan Yu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li","Providing knowledge documents for large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising solution to update the static knowledge inherent in their parameters. However, knowledge in the document may conflict with the memory of LLMs due to outdated or incorrect knowledge in the LLMs' parameters. This leads to the necessity of examining the capability of LLMs to assimilate supplemental external knowledge that conflicts with their memory. While previous studies have explained to what extent LLMs extract conflicting knowledge from the provided text, they neglect the necessity to reason with conflicting knowledge. Furthermore, there lack a detailed analysis on strategies to enable LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge via prompting, decoding strategy, and supervised fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we construct a new dataset, dubbed KNOT, for knowledge conflict resolution examination in the form of question answering. KNOT facilitates in-depth analysis by dividing reasoning with conflicting knowledge into three levels: (1) Direct Extraction, which directly extracts conflicting knowledge to answer questions. (2) Explicit Reasoning, which reasons with conflicting knowledge when the reasoning path is explicitly provided in the question. (3) Implicit Reasoning, where reasoning with conflicting knowledge requires LLMs to infer the reasoning path independently to answer questions. We also conduct extensive experiments on KNOT to establish empirical guidelines for LLMs to utilize conflicting knowledge in complex circumstances.

Select and Summarize: Scene Saliency for Movie Script Summarization,"Rohit Saxena, Frank Keller","Abstractive summarization for long-form narrative texts such as movie scripts is challenging due to the computational and memory constraints of current language models. A movie script typically comprises a large number of scenes; however, only a fraction of these scenes are salient, i.e., important for understanding the overall narrative. The salience of a scene can be operationalized by considering it as salient if it is mentioned in the summary. Automatically identifying salient scenes is difficult due to the lack of suitable datasets. In this work, we introduce a scene saliency dataset that consists of human-annotated salient scenes for 100 movies. We propose a two-stage abstractive summarization approach which first identifies the salient scenes in script and then generates a summary using only those scenes. Using QA-based evaluation, we show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art summarization methods and reflects the information content of a movie more accurately than a model that takes the whole movie script as input.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03561v1,2024-04
How does Multi-Task Training Affect Transformer In-Context Capabilities? Investigations with Function Classes,"Harmon Bhasin, Timothy Ossowski, Yiqiao Zhong, Junjie Hu","Large language models (LLM) have recently shown the extraordinary ability to perform unseen tasks based on few-shot examples provided as text, also known as in-context learning (ICL). While recent works have attempted to understand the mechanisms driving ICL, few have explored training strategies that incentivize these models to generalize to multiple tasks. Multi-task learning (MTL) for generalist models is a promising direction that offers transfer learning potential, enabling large parameterized models to be trained from simpler, related tasks. In this work, we investigate the combination of MTL with ICL to build models that efficiently learn tasks while being robust to out-of-distribution examples. We propose several effective curriculum learning strategies that allow ICL models to achieve higher data efficiency and more stable convergence. Our experiments reveal that ICL models can effectively learn difficult tasks by training on progressively harder tasks while mixing in prior tasks, denoted as mixed curriculum in this work.

From News to Summaries: Building a Hungarian Corpus for Extractive and Abstractive Summarization,"Botond Barta, Dorina Lakatos, Attila Nagy, Milán Konor Nyist, Judit Ács","Training summarization models requires substantial amounts of training data. However for less resourceful languages like Hungarian, openly available models and datasets are notably scarce. To address this gap our paper introduces HunSum-2 an open-source Hungarian corpus suitable for training abstractive and extractive summarization models. The dataset is assembled from segments of the Common Crawl corpus undergoing thorough cleaning, preprocessing and deduplication. In addition to abstractive summarization we generate sentence-level labels for extractive summarization using sentence similarity.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the trained models, we perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Our dataset, models and code are publicly available, encouraging replication, further research, and real-world applications across various domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03555v2,2024-04
CodeEditorBench: Evaluating Code Editing Capability of Large Language Models,"Jiawei Guo, Ziming Li, Xueling Liu, Kaijing Ma, Tianyu Zheng, Zhouliang Yu, Ding Pan, Yizhi LI, Ruibo Liu, Yue Wang, Shuyue Guo, Xingwei Qu, Xiang Yue, Ge Zhang, Wenhu Chen, Jie Fu","Large Language Models (LLMs) for code are rapidly evolving, with code editing emerging as a critical capability. We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03543v2,2024-04
Evaluating Generative Language Models in Information Extraction as Subjective Question Correction,"Yuchen Fan, Yantao Liu, Zijun Yao, Jifan Yu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li","Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable prowess in various tasks necessitating sophisticated cognitive behaviors. Nevertheless, a paradoxical performance discrepancy is observed, where these models underperform in seemingly elementary tasks like relation extraction and event extraction due to two issues in conventional evaluation. (1) The imprecision of existing evaluation metrics that struggle to effectively gauge semantic consistency between model outputs and ground truth, and (2) The inherent incompleteness of evaluation benchmarks, primarily due to restrictive human annotation schemas, resulting in underestimated LLM performances. Inspired by the principles in subjective question correction, we propose a new evaluation method, SQC-Score. This method innovatively utilizes LLMs, fine-tuned through subjective question correction data, to refine matching between model outputs and golden labels. Additionally, by incorporating a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model, SQC-Score enriches golden labels, addressing benchmark incompleteness by acknowledging correct yet previously omitted answers. Results on three information extraction tasks show that SQC-Score is more preferred by human annotators than the baseline metrics. Utilizing SQC-Score, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art LLMs and provide insights for future research for information extraction. Dataset and associated codes can be accessed at https://github.com/THU-KEG/SQC-Score.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03532v1,2024-04
BanglaAutoKG: Automatic Bangla Knowledge Graph Construction with Semantic Neural Graph Filtering,"Azmine Toushik Wasi, Taki Hasan Rafi, Raima Islam, Dong-Kyu Chae","Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have proven essential in information processing and reasoning applications because they link related entities and give context-rich information, supporting efficient information retrieval and knowledge discovery; presenting information flow in a very effective manner. Despite being widely used globally, Bangla is relatively underrepresented in KGs due to a lack of comprehensive datasets, encoders, NER (named entity recognition) models, POS (part-of-speech) taggers, and lemmatizers, hindering efficient information processing and reasoning applications in the language. Addressing the KG scarcity in Bengali, we propose BanglaAutoKG, a pioneering framework that is able to automatically construct Bengali KGs from any Bangla text. We utilize multilingual LLMs to understand various languages and correlate entities and relations universally. By employing a translation dictionary to identify English equivalents and extracting word features from pre-trained BERT models, we construct the foundational KG. To reduce noise and align word embeddings with our goal, we employ graph-based polynomial filters. Lastly, we implement a GNN-based semantic filter, which elevates contextual understanding and trims unnecessary edges, culminating in the formation of the definitive KG. Empirical findings and case studies demonstrate the universal effectiveness of our model, capable of autonomously constructing semantically enriched KGs from any text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03528v3,2024-04
Embedding-Informed Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models,"Chengkai Huang, Yu Xia, Rui Wang, Kaige Xie, Tong Yu, Julian McAuley, Lina Yao","Retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) have been remarkably competent in various NLP tasks. However, it was observed by previous works that retrieval is not always helpful, especially when the LLM is already knowledgeable on the query to answer. Motivated by this, Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ARAG) studies retrieving only when the knowledge asked by the query is absent in the LLM. Previous works of ARAG either require accessing the pre-training corpus or prompting with additional model inferences. Aiming to avoid such drawbacks, we propose to determine whether the model is knowledgeable on a query via inspecting the (contextualized) pre-trained token embeddings of LLMs. We hypothesize that such embeddings capture rich information on the model's intrinsic knowledge base, which enables an efficient way of judging the necessity to retrieve from an external corpus. Extensive experiments demonstrate our ARAG approach's superior performance across various benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03514v2,2024-04
A Cause-Effect Look at Alleviating Hallucination of Knowledge-grounded Dialogue Generation,"Jifan Yu, Xiaohan Zhang, Yifan Xu, Xuanyu Lei, Zijun Yao, Jing Zhang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li","Empowered by the large-scale pretrained language models, existing dialogue systems have demonstrated impressive performance conducting fluent and natural-sounding conversations. However, they are still plagued by the hallucination problem, causing unpredictable factual errors in the generated responses. Recently, knowledge-grounded dialogue generation models, that intentionally invoke external knowledge resources to more informative responses, are also proven to be effective in reducing hallucination. Following the idea of getting high-quality knowledge, a few efforts have achieved pretty good performance on this issue. As some inevitable knowledge noises may also lead to hallucinations, it is emergent to investigate the reason and future directions for building noise-tolerant methods in KGD tasks. In this paper, we analyze the causal story behind this problem with counterfactual reasoning methods. Based on the causal effect analysis, we propose a possible solution for alleviating the hallucination in KGD by exploiting the dialogue-knowledge interaction. Experimental results of our example implementation show that this method can reduce hallucination without disrupting other dialogue performance, while keeping adaptive to different generation models. We hope our efforts can support and call for more attention to developing lightweight techniques towards robust and trusty dialogue systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03491v1,2024-04
Generative AI and Teachers -- For Us or Against Us? A Case Study,"Jenny Pettersson, Elias Hult, Tim Eriksson, Tosin Adewumi","We present insightful results of a survey on the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) by university teachers in their teaching activities. The transformation of education by GenAI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has been presenting both opportunities and challenges, including cheating by students. We prepared the online survey according to best practices and the questions were created by the authors, who have pedagogy experience. The survey contained 12 questions and a pilot study was first conducted. The survey was then sent to all teachers in multiple departments across different campuses of the university of interest in Sweden: Lule{\aa} University of Technology. The survey was available in both Swedish and English. The results show that 35 teachers (more than half) use GenAI out of 67 respondents. Preparation is the teaching activity with the most frequency that GenAI is used for and ChatGPT is the most commonly used GenAI. 59% say it has impacted their teaching, however, 55% say there should be legislation around the use of GenAI, especially as inaccuracies and cheating are the biggest concerns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03486v1,2024-04
The Impact of Unstated Norms in Bias Analysis of Language Models,"Farnaz Kohankhaki, D. B. Emerson, Jacob-Junqi Tian, Laleh Seyyed-Kalantari, Faiza Khan Khattak","Bias in large language models (LLMs) has many forms, from overt discrimination to implicit stereotypes. Counterfactual bias evaluation is a widely used approach to quantifying bias and often relies on template-based probes that explicitly state group membership. It measures whether the outcome of a task, performed by an LLM, is invariant to a change of group membership. In this work, we find that template-based probes can lead to unrealistic bias measurements. For example, LLMs appear to mistakenly cast text associated with White race as negative at higher rates than other groups. We hypothesize that this arises artificially via a mismatch between commonly unstated norms, in the form of markedness, in the pretraining text of LLMs (e.g., Black president vs. president) and templates used for bias measurement (e.g., Black president vs. White president). The findings highlight the potential misleading impact of varying group membership through explicit mention in counterfactual bias quantification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03471v3,2024-04
Benchmarking ChatGPT on Algorithmic Reasoning,"Sean McLeish, Avi Schwarzschild, Tom Goldstein","We evaluate ChatGPT's ability to solve algorithm problems from the CLRS benchmark suite that is designed for GNNs. The benchmark requires the use of a specified classical algorithm to solve a given problem. We find that ChatGPT outperforms specialist GNN models, using Python to successfully solve these problems.

Knowledge Graph Representation for Political Information Sources,"Tinatin Osmonova, Alexey Tikhonov, Ivan P. Yamshchikov","With the rise of computational social science, many scholars utilize data analysis and natural language processing tools to analyze social media, news articles, and other accessible data sources for examining political and social discourse. Particularly, the study of the emergence of echo-chambers due to the dissemination of specific information has become a topic of interest in mixed methods research areas. In this paper, we analyze data collected from two news portals, Breitbart News (BN) and New York Times (NYT) to prove the hypothesis that the formation of echo-chambers can be partially explained on the level of an individual information consumption rather than a collective topology of individuals' social networks. Our research findings are presented through knowledge graphs, utilizing a dataset spanning 11.5 years gathered from BN and NYT media portals. We demonstrate that the application of knowledge representation techniques to the aforementioned news streams highlights, contrary to common assumptions, shows relative ""internal"" neutrality of both sources and polarizing attitude towards a small fraction of entities. Additionally, we argue that such characteristics in information sources lead to fundamental disparities in audience worldviews, potentially acting as a catalyst for the formation of echo-chambers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03437v1,2024-04
Scaffolding Language Learning via Multi-modal Tutoring Systems with Pedagogical Instructions,"Zhengyuan Liu, Stella Xin Yin, Carolyn Lee, Nancy F. Chen","Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that imitate human tutors and aim to provide immediate and customized instructions or feedback to learners have shown their effectiveness in education. With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) further entitle the systems to complex and coherent conversational interactions. These systems would be of great help in language education as it involves developing skills in communication, which, however, drew relatively less attention. Additionally, due to the complicated cognitive development at younger ages, more endeavors are needed for practical uses. Scaffolding refers to a teaching technique where teachers provide support and guidance to students for learning and developing new concepts or skills. It is an effective way to support diverse learning needs, goals, processes, and outcomes. In this work, we investigate how pedagogical instructions facilitate the scaffolding in ITSs, by conducting a case study on guiding children to describe images for language learning. We construct different types of scaffolding tutoring systems grounded in four fundamental learning theories: knowledge construction, inquiry-based learning, dialogic teaching, and zone of proximal development. For qualitative and quantitative analyses, we build and refine a seven-dimension rubric to evaluate the scaffolding process. In our experiment on GPT-4V, we observe that LLMs demonstrate strong potential to follow pedagogical instructions and achieve self-paced learning in different student groups. Moreover, we extend our evaluation framework from a manual to an automated approach, paving the way to benchmark various conversational tutoring systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03429v1,2024-04
Edisum: Summarizing and Explaining Wikipedia Edits at Scale,"Marija Šakota, Isaac Johnson, Guosheng Feng, Robert West","An edit summary is a succinct comment written by a Wikipedia editor explaining the nature of, and reasons for, an edit to a Wikipedia page. Edit summaries are crucial for maintaining the encyclopedia: they are the first thing seen by content moderators and they help them decide whether to accept or reject an edit. Additionally, edit summaries constitute a valuable data source for researchers. Unfortunately, as we show, for many edits, summaries are either missing or incomplete. To overcome this problem and help editors write useful edit summaries, we propose a model for recommending edit summaries generated by a language model trained to produce good edit summaries given the representation of an edit diff. To overcome the challenges of mixed-quality training data and efficiency requirements imposed by the scale of Wikipedia, we fine-tune a small generative language model on a curated mix of human and synthetic data. Our model performs on par with human editors. Commercial large language models are able to solve this task better than human editors, but are not well suited for Wikipedia, while open-source ones fail on this task. More broadly, we showcase how language modeling technology can be used to support humans in maintaining one of the largest and most visible projects on the Web.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03428v2,2024-04
Can Small Language Models Help Large Language Models Reason Better?: LM-Guided Chain-of-Thought,"Jooyoung Lee, Fan Yang, Thanh Tran, Qian Hu, Emre Barut, Kai-Wei Chang, Chengwei Su","We introduce a novel framework, LM-Guided CoT, that leverages a lightweight (i.e., <1B) language model (LM) for guiding a black-box large (i.e., >10B) LM in reasoning tasks. Specifically, the lightweight LM first generates a rationale for each input instance. The Frozen large LM is then prompted to predict a task output based on the rationale generated by the lightweight LM. Our approach is resource-efficient in the sense that it only requires training the lightweight LM. We optimize the model through 1) knowledge distillation and 2) reinforcement learning from rationale-oriented and task-oriented reward signals. We assess our method with multi-hop extractive question answering (QA) benchmarks, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms all baselines regarding answer prediction accuracy. We also find that reinforcement learning helps the model to produce higher-quality rationales with improved QA performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03414v1,2024-04
Red Teaming GPT-4V: Are GPT-4V Safe Against Uni/Multi-Modal Jailbreak Attacks?,"Shuo Chen, Zhen Han, Bailan He, Zifeng Ding, Wenqian Yu, Philip Torr, Volker Tresp, Jindong Gu","Various jailbreak attacks have been proposed to red-team Large Language Models (LLMs) and revealed the vulnerable safeguards of LLMs. Besides, some methods are not limited to the textual modality and extend the jailbreak attack to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by perturbing the visual input. However, the absence of a universal evaluation benchmark complicates the performance reproduction and fair comparison. Besides, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation of closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, especially MLLMs, such as GPT-4V. To address these issues, this work first builds a comprehensive jailbreak evaluation dataset with 1445 harmful questions covering 11 different safety policies. Based on this dataset, extensive red-teaming experiments are conducted on 11 different LLMs and MLLMs, including both SOTA proprietary models and open-source models. We then conduct a deep analysis of the evaluated results and find that (1) GPT4 and GPT-4V demonstrate better robustness against jailbreak attacks compared to open-source LLMs and MLLMs. (2) Llama2 and Qwen-VL-Chat are more robust compared to other open-source models. (3) The transferability of visual jailbreak methods is relatively limited compared to textual jailbreak methods.

Mitigating LLM Hallucinations via Conformal Abstention,"Yasin Abbasi Yadkori, Ilja Kuzborskij, David Stutz, András György, Adam Fisch, Arnaud Doucet, Iuliya Beloshapka, Wei-Hung Weng, Yao-Yuan Yang, Csaba Szepesvári, Ali Taylan Cemgil, Nenad Tomasev","We develop a principled procedure for determining when a large language model (LLM) should abstain from responding (e.g., by saying ""I don't know"") in a general domain, instead of resorting to possibly ""hallucinating"" a non-sensical or incorrect answer. Building on earlier approaches that use self-consistency as a more reliable measure of model confidence, we propose using the LLM itself to self-evaluate the similarity between each of its sampled responses for a given query. We then further leverage conformal prediction techniques to develop an abstention procedure that benefits from rigorous theoretical guarantees on the hallucination rate (error rate). Experimentally, our resulting conformal abstention method reliably bounds the hallucination rate on various closed-book, open-domain generative question answering datasets, while also maintaining a significantly less conservative abstention rate on a dataset with long responses (Temporal Sequences) compared to baselines using log-probability scores to quantify uncertainty, while achieveing comparable performance on a dataset with short answers (TriviaQA). To evaluate the experiments automatically, one needs to determine if two responses are equivalent given a question. Following standard practice, we use a thresholded similarity function to determine if two responses match, but also provide a method for calibrating the threshold based on conformal prediction, with theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of the match prediction, which might be of independent interest.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01563v1,2024-04
Learning to Plan and Generate Text with Citations,"Constanza Fierro, Reinald Kim Amplayo, Fantine Huot, Nicola De Cao, Joshua Maynez, Shashi Narayan, Mirella Lapata","The increasing demand for the deployment of LLMs in information-seeking scenarios has spurred efforts in creating verifiable systems, which generate responses to queries along with supporting evidence. In this paper, we explore the attribution capabilities of plan-based models which have been recently shown to improve the faithfulness, grounding, and controllability of generated text. We conceptualize plans as a sequence of questions which serve as blueprints of the generated content and its organization. We propose two attribution models that utilize different variants of blueprints, an abstractive model where questions are generated from scratch, and an extractive model where questions are copied from the input. Experiments on long-form question-answering show that planning consistently improves attribution quality. Moreover, the citations generated by blueprint models are more accurate compared to those obtained from LLM-based pipelines lacking a planning component.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03381v3,2024-04
nicolay-r at SemEval-2024 Task 3: Using Flan-T5 for Reasoning Emotion Cause in Conversations with Chain-of-Thought on Emotion States,"Nicolay Rusnachenko, Huizhi Liang","Emotion expression is one of the essential traits of conversations. It may be self-related or caused by another speaker. The variety of reasons may serve as a source of the further emotion causes: conversation history, speaker's emotional state, etc. Inspired by the most recent advances in Chain-of-Thought, in this work, we exploit the existing three-hop reasoning approach (THOR) to perform large language model instruction-tuning for answering: emotion states (THOR-state), and emotion caused by one speaker to the other (THOR-cause). We equip THOR-cause with the reasoning revision (rr) for devising a reasoning path in fine-tuning. In particular, we rely on the annotated speaker emotion states to revise reasoning path. Our final submission, based on Flan-T5-base (250M) and the rule-based span correction technique, preliminary tuned with THOR-state and fine-tuned with THOR-cause-rr on competition training data, results in 3rd and 4th places (F1-proportional) and 5th place (F1-strict) among 15 participating teams.

In this paper, we present a set of experiments designed to benchmark SLM inference at performance and energy levels. Our analysis provides a new perspective in serving, highlighting that the small memory footprint of SLMs allows for reaching the Pareto-optimal throughput within the resource capacity of a single accelerator.

Using Large Language Models to Enrich the Documentation of Datasets for Machine Learning,"Joan Giner-Miguelez, Abel Gómez, Jordi Cabot","Recent regulatory initiatives like the European AI Act and relevant voices in the Machine Learning (ML) community stress the need to describe datasets along several key dimensions for trustworthy AI, such as the provenance processes and social concerns. However, this information is typically presented as unstructured text in accompanying documentation, hampering their automated analysis and processing. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLM) and a set of prompting strategies to automatically extract these dimensions from documents and enrich the dataset description with them. Our approach could aid data publishers and practitioners in creating machine-readable documentation to improve the discoverability of their datasets, assess their compliance with current AI regulations, and improve the overall quality of ML models trained on them.   In this paper, we evaluate the approach on 12 scientific dataset papers published in two scientific journals (Nature's Scientific Data and Elsevier's Data in Brief) using two different LLMs (GPT3.5 and Flan-UL2). Results show good accuracy with our prompt extraction strategies. Concrete results vary depending on the dimensions, but overall, GPT3.5 shows slightly better accuracy (81,21%) than FLAN-UL2 (69,13%) although it is more prone to hallucinations. We have released an open-source tool implementing our approach and a replication package, including the experiments' code and results, in an open-source repository.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15320v2,2024-04
A Comparative Analysis of Word-Level Metric Differential Privacy: Benchmarking The Privacy-Utility Trade-off,"Stephen Meisenbacher, Nihildev Nandakumar, Alexandra Klymenko, Florian Matthes","The application of Differential Privacy to Natural Language Processing techniques has emerged in relevance in recent years, with an increasing number of studies published in established NLP outlets. In particular, the adaptation of Differential Privacy for use in NLP tasks has first focused on the $\textit{word-level}$, where calibrated noise is added to word embedding vectors to achieve ""noisy"" representations. To this end, several implementations have appeared in the literature, each presenting an alternative method of achieving word-level Differential Privacy. Although each of these includes its own evaluation, no comparative analysis has been performed to investigate the performance of such methods relative to each other. In this work, we conduct such an analysis, comparing seven different algorithms on two NLP tasks with varying hyperparameters, including the $\textit{epsilon ($\varepsilon$)}$ parameter, or privacy budget. In addition, we provide an in-depth analysis of the results with a focus on the privacy-utility trade-off, as well as open-source our implementation code for further reproduction.

M3TCM: Multi-modal Multi-task Context Model for Utterance Classification in Motivational Interviews,"Sayed Muddashir Hossain, Jan Alexandersson, Philipp Müller","Accurate utterance classification in motivational interviews is crucial to automatically understand the quality and dynamics of client-therapist interaction, and it can serve as a key input for systems mediating such interactions. Motivational interviews exhibit three important characteristics. First, there are two distinct roles, namely client and therapist. Second, they are often highly emotionally charged, which can be expressed both in text and in prosody. Finally, context is of central importance to classify any given utterance. Previous works did not adequately incorporate all of these characteristics into utterance classification approaches for mental health dialogues. In contrast, we present M3TCM, a Multi-modal, Multi-task Context Model for utterance classification. Our approach for the first time employs multi-task learning to effectively model both joint and individual components of therapist and client behaviour. Furthermore, M3TCM integrates information from the text and speech modality as well as the conversation context. With our novel approach, we outperform the state of the art for utterance classification on the recently introduced AnnoMI dataset with a relative improvement of 20% for the client- and by 15% for therapist utterance classification. In extensive ablation studies, we quantify the improvement resulting from each contribution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03312v1,2024-04
Concept -- An Evaluation Protocol on Conversational Recommender Systems with System-centric and User-centric Factors,"Chen Huang, Peixin Qin, Yang Deng, Wenqiang Lei, Jiancheng Lv, Tat-Seng Chua","The conversational recommendation system (CRS) has been criticized regarding its user experience in real-world scenarios, despite recent significant progress achieved in academia. Existing evaluation protocols for CRS may prioritize system-centric factors such as effectiveness and fluency in conversation while neglecting user-centric aspects. Thus, we propose a new and inclusive evaluation protocol, Concept, which integrates both system- and user-centric factors. We conceptualise three key characteristics in representing such factors and further divide them into six primary abilities. To implement Concept, we adopt a LLM-based user simulator and evaluator with scoring rubrics that are tailored for each primary ability. Our protocol, Concept, serves a dual purpose. First, it provides an overview of the pros and cons in current CRS models. Second, it pinpoints the problem of low usability in the ""omnipotent"" ChatGPT and offers a comprehensive reference guide for evaluating CRS, thereby setting the foundation for CRS improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03304v3,2024-04
How Easily do Irrelevant Inputs Skew the Responses of Large Language Models?,"Siye Wu, Jian Xie, Jiangjie Chen, Tinghui Zhu, Kai Zhang, Yanghua Xiao","By leveraging the retrieval of information from external knowledge databases, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced capabilities for accomplishing many knowledge-intensive tasks. However, due to the inherent flaws of current retrieval systems, there might exist irrelevant information within those retrieving top-ranked passages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the robustness of LLMs to different types of irrelevant information under various conditions. We initially introduce a framework to construct high-quality irrelevant information that ranges from semantically unrelated, partially related, and related to questions. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the constructed irrelevant information not only scores highly on similarity metrics, being highly retrieved by existing systems, but also bears semantic connections to the context. Our investigation reveals that current LLMs still face challenges in discriminating highly semantically related information and can be easily distracted by these irrelevant yet misleading content. Besides, we also find that current solutions for handling irrelevant information have limitations in improving the robustness of LLMs to such distractions.

Probing Large Language Models for Scalar Adjective Lexical Semantics and Scalar Diversity Pragmatics,"Fangru Lin, Daniel Altshuler, Janet B. Pierrehumbert","Scalar adjectives pertain to various domain scales and vary in intensity within each scale (e.g. certain is more intense than likely on the likelihood scale). Scalar implicatures arise from the consideration of alternative statements which could have been made. They can be triggered by scalar adjectives and require listeners to reason pragmatically about them. Some scalar adjectives are more likely to trigger scalar implicatures than others. This phenomenon is referred to as scalar diversity. In this study, we probe different families of Large Language Models such as GPT-4 for their knowledge of the lexical semantics of scalar adjectives and one specific aspect of their pragmatics, namely scalar diversity. We find that they encode rich lexical-semantic information about scalar adjectives. However, the rich lexical-semantic knowledge does not entail a good understanding of scalar diversity. We also compare current models of different sizes and complexities and find that larger models are not always better. Finally, we explain our probing results by leveraging linguistic intuitions and model training objectives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03301v1,2024-04
Reason from Fallacy: Enhancing Large Language Models' Logical Reasoning through Logical Fallacy Understanding,"Yanda Li, Dixuan Wang, Jiaqing Liang, Guochao Jiang, Qianyu He, Yanghua Xiao, Deqing Yang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated good performance in many reasoning tasks, but they still struggle with some complicated reasoning tasks including logical reasoning. One non-negligible reason for LLMs' suboptimal performance on logical reasoning is their overlooking of understanding logical fallacies correctly. To evaluate LLMs' capability of logical fallacy understanding (LFU), we propose five concrete tasks from three cognitive dimensions of WHAT, WHY, and HOW in this paper. Towards these LFU tasks, we have successfully constructed a new dataset LFUD based on GPT-4 accompanied by a little human effort. Our extensive experiments justify that our LFUD can be used not only to evaluate LLMs' LFU capability, but also to fine-tune LLMs to obtain significantly enhanced performance on logical reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04293v1,2024-04
Evaluating Document Simplification: On the Importance of Separately Assessing Simplicity and Meaning Preservation,"Liam Cripwell, Joël Legrand, Claire Gardent","Text simplification intends to make a text easier to read while preserving its core meaning. Intuitively and as shown in previous works, these two dimensions (simplification and meaning preservation) are often-times inversely correlated. An overly conservative text will fail to simplify sufficiently, whereas extreme simplification will degrade meaning preservation. Yet, popular evaluation metrics either aggregate meaning preservation and simplification into a single score (SARI, LENS), or target meaning preservation alone (BERTScore, QuestEval). Moreover, these metrics usually require a set of references and most previous work has only focused on sentence-level simplification. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of document-level text simplification and compare existing models using distinct metrics for meaning preservation and simplification. We leverage existing metrics from similar tasks and introduce a reference-less metric variant for simplicity, showing that models are mostly biased towards either simplification or meaning preservation, seldom performing well on both dimensions. Making use of the fact that the metrics we use are all reference-less, we also investigate the performance of existing models when applied to unseen data (where reference simplifications are unavailable).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03278v1,2024-04
Advancing Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis through Deep Learning Models,"Chen Li, Huidong Tang, Jinli Zhang, Xiujing Guo, Debo Cheng, Yasuhiko Morimoto","Aspect-based sentiment analysis predicts sentiment polarity with fine granularity. While graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are widely utilized for sentimental feature extraction, their naive application for syntactic feature extraction can compromise information preservation. This study introduces an innovative edge-enhanced GCN, named SentiSys, to navigate the syntactic graph while preserving intact feature information, leading to enhanced performance. Specifically,we first integrate a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network and a self-attention-based transformer. This combination facilitates effective text encoding, preventing the loss of information and predicting long dependency text. A bidirectional GCN (Bi-GCN) with message passing is then employed to encode relationships between entities. Additionally, unnecessary information is filtered out using an aspect-specific masking technique.

Conversational Disease Diagnosis via External Planner-Controlled Large Language Models,"Zhoujian Sun, Cheng Luo, Ziyi Liu, Zhengxing Huang","The development of large language models (LLMs) has brought unprecedented possibilities for artificial intelligence (AI) based medical diagnosis. However, the application perspective of LLMs in real diagnostic scenarios is still unclear because they are not adept at collecting patient data proactively. This study presents a LLM-based diagnostic system that enhances planning capabilities by emulating doctors. Our system involves two external planners to handle planning tasks. The first planner employs a reinforcement learning approach to formulate disease screening questions and conduct initial diagnoses. The second planner uses LLMs to parse medical guidelines and conduct differential diagnoses. By utilizing real patient electronic medical record data, we constructed simulated dialogues between virtual patients and doctors and evaluated the diagnostic abilities of our system. We demonstrated that our system obtained impressive performance in both disease screening and differential diagnoses tasks. This research represents a step towards more seamlessly integrating AI into clinical settings, potentially enhancing the accuracy and accessibility of medical diagnostics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04292v5,2024-04
RALL-E: Robust Codec Language Modeling with Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Text-to-Speech Synthesis,"Detai Xin, Xu Tan, Kai Shen, Zeqian Ju, Dongchao Yang, Yuancheng Wang, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Hiroshi Saruwatari, Shujie Liu, Jinyu Li, Sheng Zhao","We present RALL-E, a robust language modeling method for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. While previous work based on large language models (LLMs) shows impressive performance on zero-shot TTS, such methods often suffer from poor robustness, such as unstable prosody (weird pitch and rhythm/duration) and a high word error rate (WER), due to the autoregressive prediction style of language models. The core idea behind RALL-E is chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes the task into simpler steps to enhance the robustness of LLM-based TTS. To accomplish this idea, RALL-E first predicts prosody features (pitch and duration) of the input text and uses them as intermediate conditions to predict speech tokens in a CoT style. Second, RALL-E utilizes the predicted duration prompt to guide the computing of self-attention weights in Transformer to enforce the model to focus on the corresponding phonemes and prosody features when predicting speech tokens. Results of comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that, compared to a powerful baseline method VALL-E, RALL-E significantly improves the WER of zero-shot TTS from $5.6\%$ (without reranking) and $1.7\%$ (with reranking) to $2.5\%$ and $1.0\%$, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RALL-E correctly synthesizes sentences that are hard for VALL-E and reduces the error rate from $68\%$ to $4\%$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03204v3,2024-04
"Okay, Let's Do This! Modeling Event Coreference with Generated Rationales and Knowledge Distillation","Abhijnan Nath, Shadi Manafi, Avyakta Chelle, Nikhil Krishnaswamy","In NLP, Event Coreference Resolution (ECR) is the task of connecting event clusters that refer to the same underlying real-life event, usually via neural systems. In this work, we investigate using abductive free-text rationales (FTRs) generated by modern autoregressive LLMs as distant supervision of smaller student models for cross-document coreference (CDCR) of events. We implement novel rationale-oriented event clustering and knowledge distillation methods for event coreference scoring that leverage enriched information from the FTRs for improved CDCR without additional annotation or expensive document clustering. Our model using coreference specific knowledge distillation achieves SOTA B3 F1 on the ECB+ and GVC corpora and we establish a new baseline on the AIDA Phase 1 corpus.

Do Large Language Models Rank Fairly? An Empirical Study on the Fairness of LLMs as Rankers,"Yuan Wang, Xuyang Wu, Hsin-Tai Wu, Zhiqiang Tao, Yi Fang","The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in information retrieval has raised a critical reevaluation of fairness in the text-ranking models. LLMs, such as GPT models and Llama2, have shown effectiveness in natural language understanding tasks, and prior works (e.g., RankGPT) have also demonstrated that the LLMs exhibit better performance than the traditional ranking models in the ranking task. However, their fairness remains largely unexplored. This paper presents an empirical study evaluating these LLMs using the TREC Fair Ranking dataset, focusing on the representation of binary protected attributes such as gender and geographic location, which are historically underrepresented in search outcomes. Our analysis delves into how these LLMs handle queries and documents related to these attributes, aiming to uncover biases in their ranking algorithms. We assess fairness from both user and content perspectives, contributing an empirical benchmark for evaluating LLMs as the fair ranker.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03192v2,2024-04
The Probabilities Also Matter: A More Faithful Metric for Faithfulness of Free-Text Explanations in Large Language Models,"Noah Y. Siegel, Oana-Maria Camburu, Nicolas Heess, Maria Perez-Ortiz","In order to oversee advanced AI systems, it is important to understand their underlying decision-making process. When prompted, large language models (LLMs) can provide natural language explanations or reasoning traces that sound plausible and receive high ratings from human annotators. However, it is unclear to what extent these explanations are faithful, i.e., truly capture the factors responsible for the model's predictions. In this work, we introduce Correlational Explanatory Faithfulness (CEF), a metric that can be used in faithfulness tests based on input interventions. Previous metrics used in such tests take into account only binary changes in the predictions. Our metric accounts for the total shift in the model's predicted label distribution, more accurately reflecting the explanations' faithfulness. We then introduce the Correlational Counterfactual Test (CCT) by instantiating CEF on the Counterfactual Test (CT) from Atanasova et al. (2023). We evaluate the faithfulness of free-text explanations generated by few-shot-prompted LLMs from the Llama2 family on three NLP tasks. We find that our metric measures aspects of faithfulness which the CT misses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03189v2,2024-04
The Death of Feature Engineering? BERT with Linguistic Features on SQuAD 2.0,"Jiawei Li, Yue Zhang","Machine reading comprehension is an essential natural language processing task, which takes into a pair of context and query and predicts the corresponding answer to query. In this project, we developed an end-to-end question answering model incorporating BERT and additional linguistic features. We conclude that the BERT base model will be improved by incorporating the features. The EM score and F1 score are improved 2.17 and 2.14 compared with BERT(base). Our best single model reaches EM score 76.55 and F1 score 79.97 in the hidden test set. Our error analysis also shows that the linguistic architecture can help model understand the context better in that it can locate answers that BERT only model predicted ""No Answer"" wrongly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03184v1,2024-04
CONFLARE: CONFormal LArge language model REtrieval,"Pouria Rouzrokh, Shahriar Faghani, Cooper U. Gamble, Moein Shariatnia, Bradley J. Erickson","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks enable large language models (LLMs) to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and incorporate it into the context for generating responses. This mitigates hallucinations and allows for the updating of knowledge without retraining the LLM. However, RAG does not guarantee valid responses if retrieval fails to identify the necessary information as the context for response generation. Also, if there is contradictory content, the RAG response will likely reflect only one of the two possible responses. Therefore, quantifying uncertainty in the retrieval process is crucial for ensuring RAG trustworthiness. In this report, we introduce a four-step framework for applying conformal prediction to quantify retrieval uncertainty in RAG frameworks. First, a calibration set of questions answerable from the knowledge base is constructed. Each question's embedding is compared against document embeddings to identify the most relevant document chunks containing the answer and record their similarity scores. Given a user-specified error rate ({\alpha}), these similarity scores are then analyzed to determine a similarity score cutoff threshold. During inference, all chunks with similarity exceeding this threshold are retrieved to provide context to the LLM, ensuring the true answer is captured in the context with a (1-{\alpha}) confidence level. We provide a Python package that enables users to implement the entire workflow proposed in our work, only using LLMs and without human intervention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04287v1,2024-04
Uncertainty in Language Models: Assessment through Rank-Calibration,"Xinmeng Huang, Shuo Li, Mengxin Yu, Matteo Sesia, Hamed Hassani, Insup Lee, Osbert Bastani, Edgar Dobriban","Language Models (LMs) have shown promising performance in natural language generation. However, as LMs often generate incorrect or hallucinated responses, it is crucial to correctly quantify their uncertainty in responding to given inputs. In addition to verbalized confidence elicited via prompting, many uncertainty measures ($e.g.$, semantic entropy and affinity-graph-based measures) have been proposed. However, these measures can differ greatly, and it is unclear how to compare them, partly because they take values over different ranges ($e.g.$, $[0,\infty)$ or $[0,1]$). In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel and practical framework, termed $Rank$-$Calibration$, to assess uncertainty and confidence measures for LMs. Our key tenet is that higher uncertainty (or lower confidence) should imply lower generation quality, on average. Rank-calibration quantifies deviations from this ideal relationship in a principled manner, without requiring ad hoc binary thresholding of the correctness score ($e.g.$, ROUGE or METEOR). The broad applicability and the granular interpretability of our methods are demonstrated empirically.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03163v2,2024-04
BioVL-QR: Egocentric Biochemical Video-and-Language Dataset Using Micro QR Codes,"Taichi Nishimura, Koki Yamamoto, Yuto Haneji, Keiya Kajimura, Chihiro Nishiwaki, Eriko Daikoku, Natsuko Okuda, Fumihito Ono, Hirotaka Kameko, Shinsuke Mori","This paper introduces a biochemical vision-and-language dataset, which consists of 24 egocentric experiment videos, corresponding protocols, and video-and-language alignments. The key challenge in the wet-lab domain is detecting equipment, reagents, and containers is difficult because the lab environment is scattered by filling objects on the table and some objects are indistinguishable. Therefore, previous studies assume that objects are manually annotated and given for downstream tasks, but this is costly and time-consuming. To address this issue, this study focuses on Micro QR Codes to detect objects automatically. From our preliminary study, we found that detecting objects only using Micro QR Codes is still difficult because the researchers manipulate objects, causing blur and occlusion frequently. To address this, we also propose a novel object labeling method by combining a Micro QR Code detector and an off-the-shelf hand object detector. As one of the applications of our dataset, we conduct the task of generating protocols from experiment videos and find that our approach can generate accurate protocols.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03161v1,2024-04
Bias Amplification in Language Model Evolution: An Iterated Learning Perspective,"Yi Ren, Shangmin Guo, Linlu Qiu, Bailin Wang, Danica J. Sutherland","With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the prevalence of iterative interactions among these models is anticipated to increase. Notably, recent advancements in multi-round self-improving methods allow LLMs to generate new examples for training subsequent models. At the same time, multi-agent LLM systems, involving automated interactions among agents, are also increasing in prominence. Thus, in both short and long terms, LLMs may actively engage in an evolutionary process. We draw parallels between the behavior of LLMs and the evolution of human culture, as the latter has been extensively studied by cognitive scientists for decades. Our approach involves leveraging Iterated Learning (IL), a Bayesian framework that elucidates how subtle biases are magnified during human cultural evolution, to explain some behaviors of LLMs. This paper outlines key characteristics of agents' behavior in the Bayesian-IL framework, including predictions that are supported by experimental verification with various LLMs. This theoretical framework could help to more effectively predict and guide the evolution of LLMs in desired directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04286v2,2024-04

"Robust Pronoun Fidelity with English LLMs: Are they Reasoning, Repeating, or Just Biased?","Vagrant Gautam, Eileen Bingert, Dawei Zhu, Anne Lauscher, Dietrich Klakow","Robust, faithful and harm-free pronoun use for individuals is an important goal for language model development as their use increases, but prior work tends to study only one or two of these characteristics at a time. To measure progress towards the combined goal, we introduce the task of pronoun fidelity: given a context introducing a co-referring entity and pronoun, the task is to reuse the correct pronoun later. We present RUFF, a carefully-designed dataset of over 5 million instances to measure robust pronoun fidelity in English, and we evaluate 37 model variants from nine popular families, across architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder) and scales (11M-70B parameters). When an individual is introduced with a pronoun, models can mostly faithfully reuse this pronoun in the next sentence, but they are significantly worse with she/her/her, singular they and neopronouns. Moreover, models are easily distracted by non-adversarial sentences discussing other people; even one sentence with a distractor pronoun causes accuracy to drop on average by 34 percentage points. Our results show that pronoun fidelity is not robust, in a simple, naturalistic setting where humans achieve nearly 100% accuracy. We encourage researchers to bridge the gaps we find and to carefully evaluate reasoning in settings where superficial repetition might inflate perceptions of model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03134v3,2024-04

Exploring the Trade-off Between Model Performance and Explanation Plausibility of Text Classifiers Using Human Rationales,"Lucas E. Resck, Marcos M. Raimundo, Jorge Poco","Saliency post-hoc explainability methods are important tools for understanding increasingly complex NLP models. While these methods can reflect the model's reasoning, they may not align with human intuition, making the explanations not plausible. In this work, we present a methodology for incorporating rationales, which are text annotations explaining human decisions, into text classification models. This incorporation enhances the plausibility of post-hoc explanations while preserving their faithfulness. Our approach is agnostic to model architectures and explainability methods. We introduce the rationales during model training by augmenting the standard cross-entropy loss with a novel loss function inspired by contrastive learning. By leveraging a multi-objective optimization algorithm, we explore the trade-off between the two loss functions and generate a Pareto-optimal frontier of models that balance performance and plausibility. Through extensive experiments involving diverse models, datasets, and explainability methods, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the quality of model explanations without causing substantial (sometimes negligible) degradation in the original model's performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03098v1,2024-04
"Unsupervised, Bottom-up Category Discovery for Symbol Grounding with a Curious Robot","Catherine Henry, Casey Kennington","Towards addressing the Symbol Grounding Problem and motivated by early childhood language development, we leverage a robot which has been equipped with an approximate model of curiosity with particular focus on bottom-up building of unsupervised categories grounded in the physical world. That is, rather than starting with a top-down symbol (e.g., a word referring to an object) and providing meaning through the application of predetermined samples, the robot autonomously and gradually breaks up its exploration space into a series of increasingly specific unlabeled categories at which point an external expert may optionally provide a symbol association. We extend prior work by using a robot that can observe the visual world, introducing a higher dimensional sensory space, and using a more generalizable method of category building. Our experiments show that the robot learns categories based on actions and what it visually observes, and that those categories can be symbolically grounded into.https://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#comments",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03092v1,2024-04
Auditing the Use of Language Models to Guide Hiring Decisions,"Johann D. Gaebler, Sharad Goel, Aziz Huq, Prasanna Tambe","Regulatory efforts to protect against algorithmic bias have taken on increased urgency with rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), which are machine learning models that can achieve performance rivaling human experts on a wide array of tasks. A key theme of these initiatives is algorithmic ""auditing,"" but current regulations -- as well as the scientific literature -- provide little guidance on how to conduct these assessments. Here we propose and investigate one approach for auditing algorithms: correspondence experiments, a widely applied tool for detecting bias in human judgements. In the employment context, correspondence experiments aim to measure the extent to which race and gender impact decisions by experimentally manipulating elements of submitted application materials that suggest an applicant's demographic traits, such as their listed name. We apply this method to audit candidate assessments produced by several state-of-the-art LLMs, using a novel corpus of applications to K-12 teaching positions in a large public school district. We find evidence of moderate race and gender disparities, a pattern largely robust to varying the types of application material input to the models, as well as the framing of the task to the LLMs. We conclude by discussing some important limitations of correspondence experiments for auditing algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03086v1,2024-04
Construction and Application of Materials Knowledge Graph in Multidisciplinary Materials Science via Large Language Model,"Yanpeng Ye, Jie Ren, Shaozhou Wang, Yuwei Wan, Haofen Wang, Imran Razzak, Bram Hoex, Tong Xie, Wenjie Zhang","Knowledge in materials science is widely dispersed across extensive scientific literature, posing significant challenges for efficient discovery and integration of new materials. Traditional methods, often reliant on costly and time-consuming experimental approaches, further complicate rapid innovation. Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the discovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction, and traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques, integrated with large language models to extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data usability and integration.

GPT-DETOX: An In-Context Learning-Based Paraphraser for Text Detoxification,"Ali Pesaranghader, Nikhil Verma, Manasa Bharadwaj","Harmful and offensive communication or content is detrimental to social bonding and the mental state of users on social media platforms. Text detoxification is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP), where the goal is removing profanity and toxicity from text while preserving its content. Supervised and unsupervised learning are common approaches for designing text detoxification solutions. However, these methods necessitate fine-tuning, leading to computational overhead. In this paper, we propose GPT-DETOX as a framework for prompt-based in-context learning for text detoxification using GPT-3.5 Turbo. We utilize zero-shot and few-shot prompting techniques for detoxifying input sentences. To generate few-shot prompts, we propose two methods: word-matching example selection (WMES) and context-matching example selection (CMES). We additionally take into account ensemble in-context learning (EICL) where the ensemble is shaped by base prompts from zero-shot and all few-shot settings. We use ParaDetox and APPDIA as benchmark detoxification datasets. Our experimental results show that the zero-shot solution achieves promising performance, while our best few-shot setting outperforms the state-of-the-art models on ParaDetox and shows comparable results on APPDIA. Our EICL solutions obtain the greatest performance, adding at least 10% improvement, against both datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03052v1,2024-04

Decentralised Moderation for Interoperable Social Networks: A Conversation-based Approach for Pleroma and the Fediverse,"Vibhor Agarwal, Aravindh Raman, Nishanth Sastry, Ahmed M. Abdelmoniem, Gareth Tyson, Ignacio Castro","The recent development of decentralised and interoperable social networks (such as the ""fediverse"") creates new challenges for content moderators. This is because millions of posts generated on one server can easily ""spread"" to another, even if the recipient server has very different moderation policies. An obvious solution would be to leverage moderation tools to automatically tag (and filter) posts that contravene moderation policies, e.g. related to toxic speech. Recent work has exploited the conversational context of a post to improve this automatic tagging, e.g. using the replies to a post to help classify if it contains toxic speech. This has shown particular potential in environments with large training sets that contain complete conversations. This, however, creates challenges in a decentralised context, as a single conversation may be fragmented across multiple servers. Thus, each server only has a partial view of an entire conversation because conversations are often federated across servers in a non-synchronized fashion. To address this, we propose a decentralised conversation-aware content moderation approach suitable for the fediverse. Our approach employs a graph deep learning model (GraphNLI) trained locally on each server. The model exploits local data to train a model that combines post and conversational information captured through random walks to detect toxicity. We evaluate our approach with data from Pleroma, a major decentralised and interoperable micro-blogging network containing 2 million conversations. Our model effectively detects toxicity on larger instances, exclusively trained using their local post information (0.8837 macro-F1). Our approach has considerable scope to improve moderation in decentralised and interoperable social networks such as Pleroma or Mastodon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03048v2,2024-04
MuLan: A Study of Fact Mutability in Language Models,"Constanza Fierro, Nicolas Garneau, Emanuele Bugliarello, Yova Kementchedjhieva, Anders Søgaard","Facts are subject to contingencies and can be true or false in different circumstances. One such contingency is time, wherein some facts mutate over a given period, e.g., the president of a country or the winner of a championship. Trustworthy language models ideally identify mutable facts as such and process them accordingly. We create MuLan, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of English language models to anticipate time-contingency, covering both 1:1 and 1:N relations. We hypothesize that mutable facts are encoded differently than immutable ones, hence being easier to update. In a detailed evaluation of six popular large language models, we consistently find differences in the LLMs' confidence, representations, and update behavior, depending on the mutability of a fact. Our findings should inform future work on the injection of and induction of time-contingent knowledge to/from LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03036v1,2024-04
Assessing ML Classification Algorithms and NLP Techniques for Depression Detection: An Experimental Case Study,"Giuliano Lorenzoni, Cristina Tavares, Nathalia Nascimento, Paulo Alencar, Donald Cowan","Depression has affected millions of people worldwide and has become one of the most common mental disorders. Early mental disorder detection can reduce costs for public health agencies and prevent other major comorbidities. Additionally, the shortage of specialized personnel is very concerning since Depression diagnosis is highly dependent on expert professionals and is time-consuming. Recent research has evidenced that machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and techniques have significantly bene ted the diagnosis of depression. However, there are still several challenges in the assessment of depression detection approaches in which other conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are present. These challenges include assessing alternatives in terms of data cleaning and pre-processing techniques, feature selection, and appropriate ML classification algorithms. This paper tackels such an assessment based on a case study that compares different ML classifiers, specifically in terms of data cleaning and pre-processing, feature selection, parameter setting, and model choices. The case study is based on the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus - Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ) dataset, which is designed to support the diagnosis of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Besides the assessment of alternative techniques, we were able to build models with accuracy levels around 84% with Random Forest and XGBoost models, which is significantly higher than the results from the comparable literature which presented the level of accuracy of 72% from the SVM model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04284v1,2024-04
"An Incomplete Loop: Instruction Inference, Instruction Following, and In-context Learning in Language Models","Emmy Liu, Graham Neubig, Jacob Andreas","Modern language models (LMs) can learn to perform new tasks in different ways: in instruction following, the target task is described explicitly in natural language; in few-shot prompting, the task is specified implicitly with a small number of examples; in instruction inference, LMs are presented with in-context examples and are then prompted to generate a natural language task description before making predictions. Each of these procedures may be thought of as invoking a different form of reasoning: instruction following involves deductive reasoning, few-shot prompting involves inductive reasoning, and instruction inference involves abductive reasoning. How do these different capabilities relate? Across four LMs (from the gpt and llama families) and two learning problems (involving arithmetic functions and machine translation) we find a strong dissociation between the different types of reasoning: LMs can sometimes learn effectively from few-shot prompts even when they are unable to explain their own prediction rules; conversely, they sometimes infer useful task descriptions while completely failing to learn from human-generated descriptions of the same task. Our results highlight the non-systematic nature of reasoning even in some of today's largest LMs, and underscore the fact that very different learning mechanisms may be invoked by seemingly similar prompting procedures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03028v3,2024-04

In this paper, we investigate an important and unexplored question of whether techniques that successfully jailbreak Large Language Models (LLMs) can be equally effective in jailbreaking MLLMs. To explore this issue, we introduce JailBreakV-28K, a pioneering benchmark designed to assess the transferability of LLM jailbreak techniques to MLLMs, thereby evaluating the robustness of MLLMs against diverse jailbreak attacks. Utilizing a dataset of 2, 000 malicious queries that is also proposed in this paper, we generate 20, 000 text-based jailbreak prompts using advanced jailbreak attacks on LLMs, alongside 8, 000 image-based jailbreak inputs from recent MLLMs jailbreak attacks, our comprehensive dataset includes 28, 000 test cases across a spectrum of adversarial scenarios. Our evaluation of 10 open-source MLLMs reveals a notably high Attack Success Rate (ASR) for attacks transferred from LLMs, highlighting a critical vulnerability in MLLMs that stems from their text-processing capabilities.

Motivated by this, our team engaged in SemEval-2024 Task 4, a hierarchical multi-label classification task designed to identify rhetorical and psychological persuasion techniques embedded within memes. To tackle this problem, we introduced a caption generation step to assess the modality gap and the impact of additional semantic information from images, which improved our result. Our best model utilizes GPT-4 generated captions alongside meme text to fine-tune RoBERTa as the text encoder and CLIP as the image encoder. It outperforms the baseline by a large margin in all 12 subtasks. In particular, it ranked in top-3 across all languages in Subtask 2a, and top-4 in Subtask 2b, demonstrating quantitatively strong performance. The improvement achieved by the introduced intermediate step is likely attributable to the metaphorical essence of images that challenges visual encoders.

They impact consumers, voters, and many other societal groups. While Fake News exist for a centuries, Generative AI brings fake news on a new level. It is now possible to automate the creation of masses of high-quality individually targeted Fake News. On the other end, Generative AI can also help detecting Fake News. Both fields are young but developing fast.   This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the research and practical use of Generative AI for Fake News detection and creation in 2024. Following the Structured Literature Survey approach, the paper synthesizes current results in the following topic clusters 1) enabling technologies, 2) creation of Fake News, 3) case study social media as most relevant distribution channel, 4) detection of Fake News, and 5) deepfakes as upcoming technology.

Towards a Fully Interpretable and More Scalable RSA Model for Metaphor Understanding,"Gaia Carenini, Luca Bischetti, Walter Schaeken, Valentina Bambini","The Rational Speech Act (RSA) model provides a flexible framework to model pragmatic reasoning in computational terms. However, state-of-the-art RSA models are still fairly distant from modern machine learning techniques and present a number of limitations related to their interpretability and scalability. Here, we introduce a new RSA framework for metaphor understanding that addresses these limitations by providing an explicit formula - based on the mutually shared information between the speaker and the listener - for the estimation of the communicative goal and by learning the rationality parameter using gradient-based methods. The model was tested against 24 metaphors, not limited to the conventional $\textit{John-is-a-shark}$ type. Results suggest an overall strong positive correlation between the distributions generated by the model and the interpretations obtained from the human behavioral data, which increased when the intended meaning capitalized on properties that were inherent to the vehicle concept. Overall, findings suggest that metaphor processing is well captured by a typicality-based Bayesian model, even when more scalable and interpretable, opening up possible applications to other pragmatic phenomena and novel uses for increasing Large Language Models interpretability. Yet, results highlight that the more creative nuances of metaphorical meaning, not strictly encoded in the lexical concepts, are a challenging aspect for machines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02983v1,2024-04
ALOHa: A New Measure for Hallucination in Captioning Models,"Suzanne Petryk, David M. Chan, Anish Kachinthaya, Haodi Zou, John Canny, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Trevor Darrell","Despite recent advances in multimodal pre-training for visual description, state-of-the-art models still produce captions containing errors, such as hallucinating objects not present in a scene. The existing prominent metric for object hallucination, CHAIR, is limited to a fixed set of MS COCO objects and synonyms. In this work, we propose a modernized open-vocabulary metric, ALOHa, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to measure object hallucinations. Specifically, we use an LLM to extract groundable objects from a candidate caption, measure their semantic similarity to reference objects from captions and object detections, and use Hungarian matching to produce a final hallucination score. We show that ALOHa correctly identifies 13.6% more hallucinated objects than CHAIR on HAT, a new gold-standard subset of MS COCO Captions annotated for hallucinations, and 30.8% more on nocaps, where objects extend beyond MS COCO categories.

ChatGLM-Math: Improving Math Problem-Solving in Large Language Models with a Self-Critique Pipeline,"Yifan Xu, Xiao Liu, Xinghan Liu, Zhenyu Hou, Yueyan Li, Xiaohan Zhang, Zihan Wang, Aohan Zeng, Zhengxiao Du, Wenyi Zhao, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong","Large language models (LLMs) have shown excellent mastering of human language, but still struggle in real-world applications that require mathematical problem-solving. While many strategies and datasets to enhance LLMs' mathematics are developed, it remains a challenge to simultaneously maintain and improve both language and mathematical capabilities in deployed LLM systems.In this work, we tailor the Self-Critique pipeline, which addresses the challenge in the feedback learning stage of LLM alignment. We first train a general Math-Critique model from the LLM itself to provide feedback signals. Then, we sequentially employ rejective fine-tuning and direct preference optimization over the LLM's own generations for data collection. Based on ChatGLM3-32B, we conduct a series of experiments on both academic and our newly created challenging dataset, MathUserEval. Results show that our pipeline significantly enhances the LLM's mathematical problem-solving while still improving its language ability, outperforming LLMs that could be two times larger.

Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism,"Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Yu Qiao, Yiran Zhong","Sequence Parallel (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long sequences that exceed the memory limit of a single GPU. However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Cherry on Top: Parameter Heterogeneity and Quantization in Large Language Models,"Wanyun Cui, Qianle Wang","This paper reveals the phenomenon of parameter heterogeneity in large language models (LLMs). We find that a small subset of ""cherry"" parameters exhibit a disproportionately large influence on model performance, while the vast majority of parameters have minimal impact. This heterogeneity is found to be prevalent across different model families, scales, and types. Motivated by this observation, we propose CherryQ, a novel quantization method that unifies the optimization of mixed-precision parameters. CherryQ identifies and preserves the critical cherry parameters in high precision while aggressively quantizing the remaining parameters to low precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CherryQ. CherryQ outperforms existing quantization approaches in terms of perplexity and downstream task performance. Notably, our 3-bit quantized Vicuna-1.5 exhibits competitive performance compared to their 16-bit counterparts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02837v2,2024-04
Retrieving Examples from Memory for Retrieval Augmented Neural Machine Translation: A Systematic Comparison,"Maxime Bouthors, Josep Crego, Francois Yvon","Retrieval-Augmented Neural Machine Translation (RAMT) architectures retrieve examples from memory to guide the generation process. While most works in this trend explore new ways to exploit the retrieved examples, the upstream retrieval step is mostly unexplored. In this paper, we study the effect of varying retrieval methods for several translation architectures, to better understand the interplay between these two processes. We conduct experiments in two language pairs in a multi-domain setting and consider several downstream architectures based on a standard autoregressive model, an edit-based model, and a large language model with in-context learning. Our experiments show that the choice of the retrieval technique impacts the translation scores, with variance across architectures. We also discuss the effects of increasing the number and diversity of examples, which are mostly positive across the board.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02835v1,2024-04

Despite recent advances, several studies have highlighted that LLMs struggle when faced with challenging instructions, especially those that include complex constraints, hindering their effectiveness in various tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce Conifer, a novel instruction tuning dataset, designed to enhance LLMs to follow multi-level instructions with complex constraints. Utilizing GPT-4, we curate the dataset by a series of LLM-driven refinement processes to ensure high quality. We also propose a progressive learning scheme that emphasizes an easy-to-hard progression, and learning from process feedback. Models trained with Conifer exhibit remarkable improvements in instruction-following abilities, especially for instructions with complex constraints.

Identifying Climate Targets in National Laws and Policies using Machine Learning,"Matyas Juhasz, Tina Marchand, Roshan Melwani, Kalyan Dutia, Sarah Goodenough, Harrison Pim, Henry Franks","Quantified policy targets are a fundamental element of climate policy, typically characterised by domain-specific and technical language. Current methods for curating comprehensive views of global climate policy targets entail significant manual effort. At present there are few scalable methods for extracting climate targets from national laws or policies, which limits policymakers' and researchers' ability to (1) assess private and public sector alignment with global goals and (2) inform policy decisions. In this paper we present an approach for extracting mentions of climate targets from national laws and policies. We create an expert-annotated dataset identifying three categories of target ('Net Zero', 'Reduction' and 'Other' (e.g. renewable energy targets)) and train a classifier to reliably identify them in text. We investigate bias and equity impacts related to our model and identify specific years and country names as problematic features. Finally, we investigate the characteristics of the dataset produced by running this classifier on the Climate Policy Radar (CPR) dataset of global national climate laws and policies and UNFCCC submissions, highlighting the potential of automated and scalable data collection for existing climate policy databases and supporting further research. Our work represents a significant upgrade in the accessibility of these key climate policy elements for policymakers and researchers.

On Few-Shot Prompting for Controllable Question-Answer Generation in Narrative Comprehension,"Bernardo Leite, Henrique Lopes Cardoso","Question Generation aims to automatically generate questions based on a given input provided as context. A controllable question generation scheme focuses on generating questions with specific attributes, allowing better control. In this study, we propose a few-shot prompting strategy for controlling the generation of question-answer pairs from children's narrative texts. We aim to control two attributes: the question's explicitness and underlying narrative elements. With empirical evaluation, we show the effectiveness of controlling the generation process by employing few-shot prompting side by side with a reference model. Our experiments highlight instances where the few-shot strategy surpasses the reference model, particularly in scenarios such as semantic closeness evaluation and the diversity and coherency of question-answer pairs. However, these improvements are not always statistically significant.

FPT: Feature Prompt Tuning for Few-shot Readability Assessment,"Ziyang Wang, Sanwoo Lee, Hsiu-Yuan Huang, Yunfang Wu","Prompt-based methods have achieved promising results in most few-shot text classification tasks. However, for readability assessment tasks, traditional prompt methods lackcrucial linguistic knowledge, which has already been proven to be essential. Moreover, previous studies on utilizing linguistic features have shown non-robust performance in few-shot settings and may even impair model performance.To address these issues, we propose a novel prompt-based tuning framework that incorporates rich linguistic knowledge, called Feature Prompt Tuning (FPT). Specifically, we extract linguistic features from the text and embed them into trainable soft prompts. Further, we devise a new loss function to calibrate the similarity ranking order between categories. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method FTP not only exhibits a significant performance improvement over the prior best prompt-based tuning approaches, but also surpasses the previous leading methods that incorporate linguistic features. Also, our proposed model significantly outperforms the large language model gpt-3.5-turbo-16k in most cases. Our proposed method establishes a new architecture for prompt tuning that sheds light on how linguistic features can be easily adapted to linguistic-related tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02772v2,2024-04
AQuA -- Combining Experts' and Non-Experts' Views To Assess Deliberation Quality in Online Discussions Using LLMs,"Maike Behrendt, Stefan Sylvius Wagner, Marc Ziegele, Lena Wilms, Anke Stoll, Dominique Heinbach, Stefan Harmeling","Measuring the quality of contributions in political online discussions is crucial in deliberation research and computer science. Research has identified various indicators to assess online discussion quality, and with deep learning advancements, automating these measures has become feasible. While some studies focus on analyzing specific quality indicators, a comprehensive quality score incorporating various deliberative aspects is often preferred. In this work, we introduce AQuA, an additive score that calculates a unified deliberative quality score from multiple indices for each discussion post. Unlike other singular scores, AQuA preserves information on the deliberative aspects present in comments, enhancing model transparency. We develop adapter models for 20 deliberative indices, and calculate correlation coefficients between experts' annotations and the perceived deliberativeness by non-experts to weigh the individual indices into a single deliberative score. We demonstrate that the AQuA score can be computed easily from pre-trained adapters and aligns well with annotations on other datasets that have not be seen during training. The analysis of experts' vs. non-experts' annotations confirms theoretical findings in the social science literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02761v3,2024-04
Automatic Prompt Selection for Large Language Models,"Viet-Tung Do, Van-Khanh Hoang, Duy-Hung Nguyen, Shahab Sabahi, Jeff Yang, Hajime Hotta, Minh-Tien Nguyen, Hung Le","Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform various natural language processing tasks with suitable instruction prompts. However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference.

Attributions toward Artificial Agents in a modified Moral Turing Test,"Eyal Aharoni, Sharlene Fernandes, Daniel J. Brady, Caelan Alexander, Michael Criner, Kara Queen, Javier Rando, Eddy Nahmias, Victor Crespo","Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) raise important questions about whether people view moral evaluations by AI systems similarly to human-generated moral evaluations. We conducted a modified Moral Turing Test (m-MTT), inspired by Allen and colleagues' (2000) proposal, by asking people to distinguish real human moral evaluations from those made by a popular advanced AI language model: GPT-4. A representative sample of 299 U.S. adults first rated the quality of moral evaluations when blinded to their source. Remarkably, they rated the AI's moral reasoning as superior in quality to humans' along almost all dimensions, including virtuousness, intelligence, and trustworthiness, consistent with passing what Allen and colleagues call the comparative MTT. Next, when tasked with identifying the source of each evaluation (human or computer), people performed significantly above chance levels. Although the AI did not pass this test, this was not because of its inferior moral reasoning but, potentially, its perceived superiority, among other possible explanations. The emergence of language models capable of producing moral responses perceived as superior in quality to humans' raises concerns that people may uncritically accept potentially harmful moral guidance from AI. This possibility highlights the need for safeguards around generative language models in matters of morality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11854v1,2024-04
Scalable Model Editing via Customized Expert Networks,"Zihan Yao, Yu He, Tianyu Qi, Ming Li","Addressing the issues of hallucinations and outdated knowledge in large language models is critical for their reliable application. Model Editing presents a promising avenue for mitigating these challenges in a cost-effective manner. However, existing methods often suffer from unsatisfactory generalization and unintended effects on non-edited samples. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach: Scalable Model Editing via Customized Expert Networks (SCEN), which is a two-stage continuous training paradigm. Specifically, in the first stage, we train lightweight expert networks individually for each piece of knowledge that needs to be updated. Subsequently, we train a corresponding indexing neuron for each expert to control the activation state of that expert. We conducted a series of experiments on the ZsRE and Hallucination benchmarks by tuning the advanced open-source LLM, Llama2, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to current mainstream methods.

Attention is Naturally Sparse with Gaussian Distributed Input,"Yichuan Deng, Zhao Song, Chiwun Yang","The computational intensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical bottleneck, primarily due to the $O(n^2)$ complexity of the attention mechanism in transformer architectures. Addressing this, sparse attention emerges as a key innovation, aiming to reduce computational load while maintaining model performance. This study presents a rigorous theoretical analysis of the sparsity in attention scores within LLMs, particularly under the framework of Gaussian inputs. By establishing a set of foundational assumptions and employing a methodical theoretical approach, we unravel the intrinsic characteristics of attention score sparsity and its implications on computational efficiency. Our main contribution lies in providing a detailed theoretical examination of how sparsity manifests in attention mechanisms, offering insights into the potential trade-offs between computational savings and model effectiveness. This work not only advances our understanding of sparse attention but also provides a scaffold for future research in optimizing the computational frameworks of LLMs, paving the way for more scalable and efficient AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02690v1,2024-04
Cross-Architecture Transfer Learning for Linear-Cost Inference Transformers,Sehyun Choi,"Recently, multiple architectures has been proposed to improve the efficiency of the Transformer Language Models through changing the design of the self-attention block to have a linear-cost inference (LCI). A notable approach in this realm is the State-Space Machines (SSMs) architecture, which showed on-par performance on language modeling tasks with the self-attention transformers. However, such an architectural change requires a full pretraining of the weights from scratch, which incurs a huge cost to researchers and practitioners who want to use the new architectures. In the more traditional linear attention works, it has been proposed to approximate full attention with linear attention by swap-and-finetune framework. Motivated by this approach, we propose Cross-Architecture Transfer Learning (XATL), in which the weights of the shared components between LCI and self-attention-based transformers, such as layernorms, MLPs, input/output embeddings, are directly transferred to the new architecture from already pre-trained model parameters. We experimented the efficacy of the method on varying sizes and alternative attention architectures and show that \methodabbr significantly reduces the training time up to 2.5x times and converges to a better minimum with up to 2.6% stronger model on the LM benchmarks within the same compute budget.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02684v1,2024-04

Some neutral words can assume a negative connotation when functioning as pejorative epithets. Disambiguating the meaning of such terms might help the detection of misogyny. In order to address such task, we present PejorativITy, a novel corpus of 1,200 manually annotated Italian tweets for pejorative language at the word level and misogyny at the sentence level. We evaluate the impact of injecting information about disambiguated words into a model targeting misogyny detection. In particular, we explore two different approaches for injection: concatenation of pejorative information and substitution of ambiguous words with univocal terms. Our experimental results, both on our corpus and on two popular benchmarks on Italian tweets, show that both approaches lead to a major classification improvement, indicating that word sense disambiguation is a promising preliminary step for misogyny detection.

Rethinking Kullback-Leibler Divergence in Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models,"Taiqiang Wu, Chaofan Tao, Jiahao Wang, Runming Yang, Zhe Zhao, Ngai Wong","Kullback-Leiber divergence has been widely used in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to compress Large Language Models (LLMs). Contrary to prior assertions that reverse Kullback-Leibler (RKL) divergence is mode-seeking and thus preferable over the mean-seeking forward Kullback-Leibler (FKL) divergence, this study empirically and theoretically demonstrates that neither mode-seeking nor mean-seeking properties manifest in KD for LLMs. Instead, RKL and FKL are found to share the same optimization objective and both converge after a sufficient number of epochs. However, due to practical constraints, LLMs are seldom trained for such an extensive number of epochs. Meanwhile, we further find that RKL focuses on the tail part of the distributions, while FKL focuses on the head part at the beginning epochs. Consequently, we propose a simple yet effective Adaptive Kullback-Leiber (AKL) divergence method, which adaptively allocates weights to combine FKL and RKL. Metric-based and GPT-4-based evaluations demonstrate that the proposed AKL outperforms the baselines across various tasks and improves the diversity and quality of generated responses.

Calibrating the Confidence of Large Language Models by Eliciting Fidelity,"Mozhi Zhang, Mianqiu Huang, Rundong Shi, Linsen Guo, Chong Peng, Peng Yan, Yaqian Zhou, Xipeng Qiu","Large language models optimized with techniques like RLHF have achieved good alignment in being helpful and harmless. However, post-alignment, these language models often exhibit overconfidence, where the expressed confidence does not accurately calibrate with their correctness rate. In this paper, we decompose the language model confidence into the \textit{Uncertainty} about the question and the \textit{Fidelity} to the answer generated by language models. Then, we propose a plug-and-play method to estimate the confidence of language models. Our method has shown good calibration performance by conducting experiments with 6 RLHF-LMs on four MCQA datasets. Moreover, we propose two novel metrics, IPR and CE, to evaluate the calibration of the model, and we have conducted a detailed discussion on \textit{Truly Well-Calibrated Confidence}.

Towards detecting unanticipated bias in Large Language Models,Anna Kruspe,"Over the last year, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have become widely available and have exhibited fairness issues similar to those in previous machine learning systems. Current research is primarily focused on analyzing and quantifying these biases in training data and their impact on the decisions of these models, alongside developing mitigation strategies. This research largely targets well-known biases related to gender, race, ethnicity, and language. However, it is clear that LLMs are also affected by other, less obvious implicit biases. The complex and often opaque nature of these models makes detecting such biases challenging, yet this is crucial due to their potential negative impact in various applications. In this paper, we explore new avenues for detecting these unanticipated biases in LLMs, focusing specifically on Uncertainty Quantification and Explainable AI methods. These approaches aim to assess the certainty of model decisions and to make the internal decision-making processes of LLMs more transparent, thereby identifying and understanding biases that are not immediately apparent. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the development of fairer and more transparent AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02650v1,2024-04
A Differentiable Integer Linear Programming Solver for Explanation-Based Natural Language Inference,"Mokanarangan Thayaparan, Marco Valentino, André Freitas","Integer Linear Programming (ILP) has been proposed as a formalism for encoding precise structural and semantic constraints for Natural Language Inference (NLI). However, traditional ILP frameworks are non-differentiable, posing critical challenges for the integration of continuous language representations based on deep learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, named Diff-Comb Explainer, a neuro-symbolic architecture for explanation-based NLI based on Differentiable BlackBox Combinatorial Solvers (DBCS). Differently from existing neuro-symbolic solvers, Diff-Comb Explainer does not necessitate a continuous relaxation of the semantic constraints, enabling a direct, more precise, and efficient incorporation of neural representations into the ILP formulation. Our experiments demonstrate that Diff-Comb Explainer achieves superior performance when compared to conventional ILP solvers, neuro-symbolic black-box solvers, and Transformer-based encoders. Moreover, a deeper analysis reveals that Diff-Comb Explainer can significantly improve the precision, consistency, and faithfulness of the constructed explanations, opening new opportunities for research on neuro-symbolic architectures for explainable and transparent NLI in complex domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02625v1,2024-04
Estimating the Causal Effects of Natural Logic Features in Transformer-Based NLI Models,"Julia Rozanova, Marco Valentino, André Freitas","Rigorous evaluation of the causal effects of semantic features on language model predictions can be hard to achieve for natural language reasoning problems. However, this is such a desirable form of analysis from both an interpretability and model evaluation perspective, that it is valuable to investigate specific patterns of reasoning with enough structure and regularity to identify and quantify systematic reasoning failures in widely-used models. In this vein, we pick a portion of the NLI task for which an explicit causal diagram can be systematically constructed: the case where across two sentences (the premise and hypothesis), two related words/terms occur in a shared context. In this work, we apply causal effect estimation strategies to measure the effect of context interventions (whose effect on the entailment label is mediated by the semantic monotonicity characteristic) and interventions on the inserted word-pair (whose effect on the entailment label is mediated by the relation between these words). Extending related work on causal analysis of NLP models in different settings, we perform an extensive interventional study on the NLI task to investigate robustness to irrelevant changes and sensitivity to impactful changes of Transformers. The results strongly bolster the fact that similar benchmark accuracy scores may be observed for models that exhibit very different behaviour. Moreover, our methodology reinforces previously suspected biases from a causal perspective, including biases in favour of upward-monotone contexts and ignoring the effects of negation markers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02622v1,2024-04
Adjusting Interpretable Dimensions in Embedding Space with Human Judgments,"Katrin Erk, Marianna Apidianaki","Embedding spaces contain interpretable dimensions indicating gender, formality in style, or even object properties. This has been observed multiple times. Such interpretable dimensions are becoming valuable tools in different areas of study, from social science to neuroscience. The standard way to compute these dimensions uses contrasting seed words and computes difference vectors over them. This is simple but does not always work well. We combine seed-based vectors with guidance from human ratings of where words fall along a specific dimension, and evaluate on predicting both object properties like size and danger, and the stylistic properties of formality and complexity. We obtain interpretable dimensions with markedly better performance especially in cases where seed-based dimensions do not work well.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02619v1,2024-04
Improving Topic Relevance Model by Mix-structured Summarization and LLM-based Data Augmentation,"Yizhu Liu, Ran Tao, Shengyu Guo, Yifan Yang","Topic relevance between query and document is a very important part of social search, which can evaluate the degree of matching between document and user's requirement. In most social search scenarios such as Dianping, modeling search relevance always faces two challenges. One is that many documents in social search are very long and have much redundant information. The other is that the training data for search relevance model is difficult to get, especially for multi-classification relevance model. To tackle above two problems, we first take query concatenated with the query-based summary and the document summary without query as the input of topic relevance model, which can help model learn the relevance degree between query and the core topic of document. Then, we utilize the language understanding and generation abilities of large language model (LLM) to rewrite and generate query from queries and documents in existing training data, which can construct new query-document pairs as training data. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests show that the proposed approaches effectively improve the performance of relevance modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02616v1,2024-04
Leveraging the Interplay Between Syntactic and Acoustic Cues for Optimizing Korean TTS Pause Formation,"Yejin Jeon, Yunsu Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee","Contemporary neural speech synthesis models have indeed demonstrated remarkable proficiency in synthetic speech generation as they have attained a level of quality comparable to that of human-produced speech. Nevertheless, it is important to note that these achievements have predominantly been verified within the context of high-resource languages such as English. Furthermore, the Tacotron and FastSpeech variants show substantial pausing errors when applied to the Korean language, which affects speech perception and naturalness. In order to address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel framework that incorporates comprehensive modeling of both syntactic and acoustic cues that are associated with pausing patterns. Remarkably, our framework possesses the capability to consistently generate natural speech even for considerably more extended and intricate out-of-domain (OOD) sentences, despite its training on short audio clips.

It is essential for providing personalized services in various applications of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), such as AI-based mental therapy and companion robots for the elderly. Most recent studies analyze the dialog content for personality classification yet overlook two major concerns that hinder their performance. First, crucial implicit factors contained in conversation, such as emotions that reflect the speakers' personalities are ignored. Second, only focusing on the input dialog content disregards the semantic understanding of personality itself, which reduces the interpretability of the results. In this paper, we propose Affective Natural Language Inference (Affective-NLI) for accurate and interpretable PRC. To utilize affectivity within dialog content for accurate personality recognition, we fine-tuned a pre-trained language model specifically for emotion recognition in conversations, facilitating real-time affective annotations for utterances. For interpretability of recognition results, we formulate personality recognition as an NLI problem by determining whether the textual description of personality labels is entailed by the dialog content. Extensive experiments on two daily conversation datasets suggest that Affective-NLI significantly outperforms (by 6%-7%) state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, our Flow experiment demonstrates that Affective-NLI can accurately recognize the speaker's personality in the early stages of conversations by surpassing state-of-the-art methods with 22%-34%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02589v1,2024-04
Large Language Models for Expansion of Spoken Language Understanding Systems to New Languages,"Jakub Hoscilowicz, Pawel Pawlowski, Marcin Skorupa, Marcin Sowański, Artur Janicki","Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) models are a core component of voice assistants (VA), such as Alexa, Bixby, and Google Assistant. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline designed to extend SLU systems to new languages, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) that we fine-tune for machine translation of slot-annotated SLU training data. Our approach improved on the MultiATIS++ benchmark, a primary multi-language SLU dataset, in the cloud scenario using an mBERT model. Specifically, we saw an improvement in the Overall Accuracy metric: from 53% to 62.18%, compared to the existing state-of-the-art method, Fine and Coarse-grained Multi-Task Learning Framework (FC-MTLF). In the on-device scenario (tiny and not pretrained SLU), our method improved the Overall Accuracy from 5.31% to 22.06% over the baseline Global-Local Contrastive Learning Framework (GL-CLeF) method. Contrary to both FC-MTLF and GL-CLeF, our LLM-based machine translation does not require changes in the production architecture of SLU. Additionally, our pipeline is slot-type independent: it does not require any slot definitions or examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02588v1,2024-04
Multi-Granularity Guided Fusion-in-Decoder,"Eunseong Choi, Hyeri Lee, Jongwuk Lee","In Open-domain Question Answering (ODQA), it is essential to discern relevant contexts as evidence and avoid spurious ones among retrieved results. The model architecture that uses concatenated multiple contexts in the decoding phase, i.e., Fusion-in-Decoder, demonstrates promising performance but generates incorrect outputs from seemingly plausible contexts. To address this problem, we propose the Multi-Granularity guided Fusion-in-Decoder (MGFiD), discerning evidence across multiple levels of granularity. Based on multi-task learning, MGFiD harmonizes passage re-ranking with sentence classification. It aggregates evident sentences into an anchor vector that instructs the decoder. Additionally, it improves decoding efficiency by reusing the results of passage re-ranking for passage pruning. Through our experiments, MGFiD outperforms existing models on the Natural Questions (NQ) and TriviaQA (TQA) datasets, highlighting the benefits of its multi-granularity solution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02581v1,2024-04
Language Models as Compilers: Simulating Pseudocode Execution Improves Algorithmic Reasoning in Language Models,"Hyungjoo Chae, Yeonghyeon Kim, Seungone Kim, Kai Tzu-iunn Ong, Beong-woo Kwak, Moohyeon Kim, Seonghwan Kim, Taeyoon Kwon, Jiwan Chung, Youngjae Yu, Jinyoung Yeo","Algorithmic reasoning refers to the ability to understand the complex patterns behind the problem and decompose them into a sequence of reasoning steps towards the solution. Such nature of algorithmic reasoning makes it a challenge for large language models (LLMs), even though they have demonstrated promising performance in other reasoning tasks. Within this context, some recent studies use programming languages (e.g., Python) to express the necessary logic for solving a given instance/question (e.g., Program-of-Thought) as inspired by their strict and precise syntaxes. However, it is non-trivial to write an executable code that expresses the correct logic on the fly within a single inference call. Also, the code generated specifically for an instance cannot be reused for others, even if they are from the same task and might require identical logic to solve. This paper presents Think-and-Execute, a novel framework that decomposes the reasoning process of language models into two steps. (1) In Think, we discover a task-level logic that is shared across all instances for solving a given task and then express the logic with pseudocode; (2) In Execute, we further tailor the generated pseudocode to each instance and simulate the execution of the code. With extensive experiments on seven algorithmic reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Think-and-Execute. Our approach better improves LMs' reasoning compared to several strong baselines performing instance-specific reasoning (e.g., CoT and PoT), suggesting the helpfulness of discovering task-level logic. Also, we show that compared to natural language, pseudocode can better guide the reasoning of LMs, even though they are trained to follow natural language instructions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02575v1,2024-04
Personality-affected Emotion Generation in Dialog Systems,"Zhiyuan Wen, Jiannong Cao, Jiaxing Shen, Ruosong Yang, Shuaiqi Liu, Maosong Sun","Generating appropriate emotions for responses is essential for dialog systems to provide human-like interaction in various application scenarios. Most previous dialog systems tried to achieve this goal by learning empathetic manners from anonymous conversational data. However, emotional responses generated by those methods may be inconsistent, which will decrease user engagement and service quality. Psychological findings suggest that the emotional expressions of humans are rooted in personality traits. Therefore, we propose a new task, Personality-affected Emotion Generation, to generate emotion based on the personality given to the dialog system and further investigate a solution through the personality-affected mood transition. Specifically, we first construct a daily dialog dataset, Personality EmotionLines Dataset (PELD), with emotion and personality annotations. Subsequently, we analyze the challenges in this task, i.e., (1) heterogeneously integrating personality and emotional factors and (2) extracting multi-granularity emotional information in the dialog context. Finally, we propose to model the personality as the transition weight by simulating the mood transition process in the dialog system and solve the challenges above. We conduct extensive experiments on PELD for evaluation. Results suggest that by adopting our method, the emotion generation performance is improved by 13% in macro-F1 and 5% in weighted-F1 from the BERT-base model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07229v1,2024-04

The task aims to detect semantic relatedness of two sentences in a given target language without access to direct supervision (i.e. zero-shot cross-lingual transfer). To this end, we focus on different source language selection strategies on two different pre-trained languages models: XLM-R and Furina. We experiment with 1) single-source transfer and select source languages based on typological similarity, 2) augmenting English training data with the two nearest-neighbor source languages, and 3) multi-source transfer where we compare selecting on all training languages against languages from the same family. We further study machine translation-based data augmentation and the impact of script differences.

CSEPrompts: A Benchmark of Introductory Computer Science Prompts,"Nishat Raihan, Dhiman Goswami, Sadiya Sayara Chowdhury Puspo, Christian Newman, Tharindu Ranasinghe, Marcos Zampieri","Recent advances in AI, machine learning, and NLP have led to the development of a new generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) that are trained on massive amounts of data and often have trillions of parameters. Commercial applications (e.g., ChatGPT) have made this technology available to the general public, thus making it possible to use LLMs to produce high-quality texts for academic and professional purposes. Schools and universities are aware of the increasing use of AI-generated content by students and they have been researching the impact of this new technology and its potential misuse. Educational programs in Computer Science (CS) and related fields are particularly affected because LLMs are also capable of generating programming code in various programming languages. To help understand the potential impact of publicly available LLMs in CS education, we introduce CSEPrompts, a framework with hundreds of programming exercise prompts and multiple-choice questions retrieved from introductory CS and programming courses. We also provide experimental results on CSEPrompts to evaluate the performance of several LLMs with respect to generating Python code and answering basic computer science and programming questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02540v2,2024-04
ANGOFA: Leveraging OFA Embedding Initialization and Synthetic Data for Angolan Language Model,"Osvaldo Luamba Quinjica, David Ifeoluwa Adelani","In recent years, the development of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has gained momentum, showcasing their capacity to transcend linguistic barriers and facilitate knowledge transfer across diverse languages. However, this progress has predominantly bypassed the inclusion of very-low resource languages, creating a notable void in the multilingual landscape. This paper addresses this gap by introducing four tailored PLMs specifically finetuned for Angolan languages, employing a Multilingual Adaptive Fine-tuning (MAFT) approach. In this paper, we survey the role of informed embedding initialization and synthetic data in enhancing the performance of MAFT models in downstream tasks. We improve baseline over SOTA AfroXLMR-base (developed through MAFT) and OFA (an effective embedding initialization) by 12.3 and 3.8 points respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02534v1,2024-04
Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM's Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game,"Qianqiao Xu, Zhiliang Tian, Hongyan Wu, Zhen Huang, Yiping Song, Feng Liu, Dongsheng Li","With the enhanced performance of large models on natural language processing tasks, potential moral and ethical issues of large models arise. There exist malicious attackers who induce large models to jailbreak and generate information containing illegal, privacy-invasive information through techniques such as prompt engineering. As a result, large models counter malicious attackers' attacks using techniques such as safety alignment. However, the strong defense mechanism of the large model through rejection replies is easily identified by attackers and used to strengthen attackers' capabilities. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent attacker-disguiser game approach to achieve a weak defense mechanism that allows the large model to both safely reply to the attacker and hide the defense intent. First, we construct a multi-agent framework to simulate attack and defense scenarios, playing different roles to be responsible for attack, disguise, safety evaluation, and disguise evaluation tasks. After that, we design attack and disguise game algorithms to optimize the game strategies of the attacker and the disguiser and use the curriculum learning process to strengthen the capabilities of the agents. The experiments verify that the method in this paper is more effective in strengthening the model's ability to disguise the defense intent compared with other methods. Moreover, our approach can adapt any black-box large model to assist the model in defense and does not suffer from model version iterations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02532v1,2024-04
A School Student Essay Corpus for Analyzing Interactions of Argumentative Structure and Quality,"Maja Stahl, Nadine Michel, Sebastian Kilsbach, Julian Schmidtke, Sara Rezat, Henning Wachsmuth","Learning argumentative writing is challenging. Besides writing fundamentals such as syntax and grammar, learners must select and arrange argument components meaningfully to create high-quality essays. To support argumentative writing computationally, one step is to mine the argumentative structure. When combined with automatic essay scoring, interactions of the argumentative structure and quality scores can be exploited for comprehensive writing support. Although studies have shown the usefulness of using information about the argumentative structure for essay scoring, no argument mining corpus with ground-truth essay quality annotations has been published yet. Moreover, none of the existing corpora contain essays written by school students specifically. To fill this research gap, we present a German corpus of 1,320 essays from school students of two age groups. Each essay has been manually annotated for argumentative structure and quality on multiple levels of granularity. We propose baseline approaches to argument mining and essay scoring, and we analyze interactions between both tasks, thereby laying the ground for quality-oriented argumentative writing support.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02529v1,2024-04

Lifelong Event Detection with Embedding Space Separation and Compaction,"Chengwei Qin, Ruirui Chen, Ruochen Zhao, Wenhan Xia, Shafiq Joty","To mitigate forgetting, existing lifelong event detection methods typically maintain a memory module and replay the stored memory data during the learning of a new task. However, the simple combination of memory data and new-task samples can still result in substantial forgetting of previously acquired knowledge, which may occur due to the potential overlap between the feature distribution of new data and the previously learned embedding space. Moreover, the model suffers from overfitting on the few memory samples rather than effectively remembering learned patterns. To address the challenges of forgetting and overfitting, we propose a novel method based on embedding space separation and compaction. Our method alleviates forgetting of previously learned tasks by forcing the feature distribution of new data away from the previous embedding space. It also mitigates overfitting by a memory calibration mechanism that encourages memory data to be close to its prototype to enhance intra-class compactness. In addition, the learnable parameters of the new task are initialized by drawing upon acquired knowledge from the previously learned task to facilitate forward knowledge transfer. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02507v1,2024-04
Dynamic Demonstration Retrieval and Cognitive Understanding for Emotional Support Conversation,"Zhe Xu, Daoyuan Chen, Jiayi Kuang, Zihao Yi, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen","Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems are pivotal in providing empathetic interactions, aiding users through negative emotional states by understanding and addressing their unique experiences. In this paper, we tackle two key challenges in ESC: enhancing contextually relevant and empathetic response generation through dynamic demonstration retrieval, and advancing cognitive understanding to grasp implicit mental states comprehensively. We introduce Dynamic Demonstration Retrieval and Cognitive-Aspect Situation Understanding (\ourwork), a novel approach that synergizes these elements to improve the quality of support provided in ESCs. By leveraging in-context learning and persona information, we introduce an innovative retrieval mechanism that selects informative and personalized demonstration pairs. We also propose a cognitive understanding module that utilizes four cognitive relationships from the ATOMIC knowledge source to deepen situational awareness of help-seekers' mental states. Our supportive decoder integrates information from diverse knowledge sources, underpinning response generation that is both empathetic and cognitively aware. The effectiveness of \ourwork is demonstrated through extensive automatic and human evaluations, revealing substantial improvements over numerous state-of-the-art models, with up to 13.79\% enhancement in overall performance of ten metrics.

Measuring Social Norms of Large Language Models,"Ye Yuan, Kexin Tang, Jianhao Shen, Ming Zhang, Chenguang Wang","We present a new challenge to examine whether large language models understand social norms. In contrast to existing datasets, our dataset requires a fundamental understanding of social norms to solve. Our dataset features the largest set of social norm skills, consisting of 402 skills and 12,383 questions covering a wide set of social norms ranging from opinions and arguments to culture and laws. We design our dataset according to the K-12 curriculum. This enables the direct comparison of the social understanding of large language models to humans, more specifically, elementary students. While prior work generates nearly random accuracy on our benchmark, recent large language models such as GPT3.5-Turbo and LLaMA2-Chat are able to improve the performance significantly, only slightly below human performance. We then propose a multi-agent framework based on large language models to improve the models' ability to understand social norms. This method further improves large language models to be on par with humans. Given the increasing adoption of large language models in real-world applications, our finding is particularly important and presents a unique direction for future improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02491v4,2024-04
Enhancing Cross-lingual Sentence Embedding for Low-resource Languages with Word Alignment,"Zhongtao Miao, Qiyu Wu, Kaiyan Zhao, Zilong Wu, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka","The field of cross-lingual sentence embeddings has recently experienced significant advancements, but research concerning low-resource languages has lagged due to the scarcity of parallel corpora. This paper shows that cross-lingual word representation in low-resource languages is notably under-aligned with that in high-resource languages in current models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly aligns words between English and eight low-resource languages, utilizing off-the-shelf word alignment models. This framework incorporates three primary training objectives: aligned word prediction and word translation ranking, along with the widely used translation ranking. We evaluate our approach through experiments on the bitext retrieval task, which demonstrate substantial improvements on sentence embeddings in low-resource languages. In addition, the competitive performance of the proposed model across a broader range of tasks in high-resource languages underscores its practicality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02490v1,2024-04
DUQGen: Effective Unsupervised Domain Adaptation of Neural Rankers by Diversifying Synthetic Query Generation,"Ramraj Chandradevan, Kaustubh D. Dhole, Eugene Agichtein","State-of-the-art neural rankers pre-trained on large task-specific training data such as MS-MARCO, have been shown to exhibit strong performance on various ranking tasks without domain adaptation, also called zero-shot. However, zero-shot neural ranking may be sub-optimal, as it does not take advantage of the target domain information. Unfortunately, acquiring sufficiently large and high quality target training data to improve a modern neural ranker can be costly and time-consuming. To address this problem, we propose a new approach to unsupervised domain adaptation for ranking, DUQGen, which addresses a critical gap in prior literature, namely how to automatically generate both effective and diverse synthetic training data to fine tune a modern neural ranker for a new domain. Specifically, DUQGen produces a more effective representation of the target domain by identifying clusters of similar documents; and generates a more diverse training dataset by probabilistic sampling over the resulting document clusters. Our extensive experiments, over the standard BEIR collection, demonstrate that DUQGen consistently outperforms all zero-shot baselines and substantially outperforms the SOTA baselines on 16 out of 18 datasets, for an average of 4% relative improvement across all datasets. We complement our results with a thorough analysis for more in-depth understanding of the proposed method's performance and to identify promising areas for further improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02489v1,2024-04

Building upon this benchmark, we investigate how different prompting methods enhance LLMs' performance on this task to reveal their inherent power for outside-the-box thinking ability. Through participating in SemEval-2024, task 9, Sentence Puzzle sub-task, we explore prompt engineering methods: chain of thoughts (CoT) and direct prompting, enhancing with informative descriptions, and employing contextualizing prompts using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Our experiments involve three LLMs including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Zephyr-7B-beta. We generate a dataset of thinking paths between riddles and options using GPT-4, validated by humans for quality.

Prompting for Numerical Sequences: A Case Study on Market Comment Generation,"Masayuki Kawarada, Tatsuya Ishigaki, Hiroya Takamura","Large language models (LLMs) have been applied to a wide range of data-to-text generation tasks, including tables, graphs, and time-series numerical data-to-text settings. While research on generating prompts for structured data such as tables and graphs is gaining momentum, in-depth investigations into prompting for time-series numerical data are lacking. Therefore, this study explores various input representations, including sequences of tokens and structured formats such as HTML, LaTeX, and Python-style codes. In our experiments, we focus on the task of Market Comment Generation, which involves taking a numerical sequence of stock prices as input and generating a corresponding market comment. Contrary to our expectations, the results show that prompts resembling programming languages yield better outcomes, whereas those similar to natural languages and longer formats, such as HTML and LaTeX, are less effective.

PhonologyBench: Evaluating Phonological Skills of Large Language Models,"Ashima Suvarna, Harshita Khandelwal, Nanyun Peng","Phonology, the study of speech's structure and pronunciation rules, is a critical yet often overlooked component in Large Language Model (LLM) research. LLMs are widely used in various downstream applications that leverage phonology such as educational tools and poetry generation. Moreover, LLMs can potentially learn imperfect associations between orthographic and phonological forms from the training data. Thus, it is imperative to benchmark the phonological skills of LLMs. To this end, we present PhonologyBench, a novel benchmark consisting of three diagnostic tasks designed to explicitly test the phonological skills of LLMs in English: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, syllable counting, and rhyme word generation. Despite having no access to speech data, LLMs showcased notable performance on the PhonologyBench tasks. However, we observe a significant gap of 17% and 45% on Rhyme Word Generation and Syllable counting, respectively, when compared to humans. Our findings underscore the importance of studying LLM performance on phonological tasks that inadvertently impact real-world applications. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to choose LLMs that perform well on the phonological task that is closely related to the downstream application since we find that no single model consistently outperforms the others on all the tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02456v2,2024-04
Adaptive Cross-lingual Text Classification through In-Context One-Shot Demonstrations,"Emilio Villa-Cueva, A. Pastor López-Monroy, Fernando Sánchez-Vega, Thamar Solorio","Zero-Shot Cross-lingual Transfer (ZS-XLT) utilizes a model trained in a source language to make predictions in another language, often with a performance loss. To alleviate this, additional improvements can be achieved through subsequent adaptation using examples in the target language. In this paper, we exploit In-Context Tuning (ICT) for One-Shot Cross-lingual transfer in the classification task by introducing In-Context Cross-lingual Transfer (IC-XLT). The novel concept involves training a model to learn from context examples and subsequently adapting it during inference to a target language by prepending a One-Shot context demonstration in that language. Our results show that IC-XLT successfully leverages target-language examples to improve the cross-lingual capabilities of the evaluated mT5 model, outperforming prompt-based models in the Zero and Few-shot scenarios adapted through fine-tuning. Moreover, we show that when source-language data is limited, the fine-tuning framework employed for IC-XLT performs comparably to prompt-based fine-tuning with significantly more training data in the source language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02452v1,2024-04
Min-K%++: Improved Baseline for Detecting Pre-Training Data from Large Language Models,"Jingyang Zhang, Jingwei Sun, Eric Yeats, Yang Ouyang, Martin Kuo, Jianyi Zhang, Hao Frank Yang, Hai Li","The problem of pre-training data detection for large language models (LLMs) has received growing attention due to its implications in critical issues like copyright violation and test data contamination. Despite improved performance, existing methods (including the state-of-the-art, Min-K%) are mostly developed upon simple heuristics and lack solid, reasonable foundations. In this work, we propose a novel and theoretically motivated methodology for pre-training data detection, named Min-K%++. Specifically, we present a key insight that training samples tend to be local maxima of the modeled distribution along each input dimension through maximum likelihood training, which in turn allow us to insightfully translate the problem into identification of local maxima. Then, we design our method accordingly that works under the discrete distribution modeled by LLMs, whose core idea is to determine whether the input forms a mode or has relatively high probability under the conditional categorical distribution. Empirically, the proposed method achieves new SOTA performance across multiple settings. On the WikiMIA benchmark, Min-K%++ outperforms the runner-up by 6.2% to 10.5% in detection AUROC averaged over five models. On the more challenging MIMIR benchmark, it consistently improves upon reference-free methods while performing on par with reference-based method that requires an extra reference model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02936v3,2024-04
The Promises and Pitfalls of Using Language Models to Measure Instruction Quality in Education,"Paiheng Xu, Jing Liu, Nathan Jones, Julie Cohen, Wei Ai","Assessing instruction quality is a fundamental component of any improvement efforts in the education system. However, traditional manual assessments are expensive, subjective, and heavily dependent on observers' expertise and idiosyncratic factors, preventing teachers from getting timely and frequent feedback. Different from prior research that mostly focuses on low-inference instructional practices on a singular basis, this paper presents the first study that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assess multiple high-inference instructional practices in two distinct educational settings: in-person K-12 classrooms and simulated performance tasks for pre-service teachers. This is also the first study that applies NLP to measure a teaching practice that is widely acknowledged to be particularly effective for students with special needs. We confront two challenges inherent in NLP-based instructional analysis, including noisy and long input data and highly skewed distributions of human ratings. Our results suggest that pretrained Language Models (PLMs) demonstrate performances comparable to the agreement level of human raters for variables that are more discrete and require lower inference, but their efficacy diminishes with more complex teaching practices. Interestingly, using only teachers' utterances as input yields strong results for student-centered variables, alleviating common concerns over the difficulty of collecting and transcribing high-quality student speech data in in-person teaching settings. Our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of current NLP techniques in the education domain, opening avenues for further exploration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02444v1,2024-04
From Narratives to Numbers: Valid Inference Using Language Model Predictions from Verbal Autopsy Narratives,"Shuxian Fan, Adam Visokay, Kentaro Hoffman, Stephen Salerno, Li Liu, Jeffrey T. Leek, Tyler H. McCormick","In settings where most deaths occur outside the healthcare system, verbal autopsies (VAs) are a common tool to monitor trends in causes of death (COD). VAs are interviews with a surviving caregiver or relative that are used to predict the decedent's COD. Turning VAs into actionable insights for researchers and policymakers requires two steps (i) predicting likely COD using the VA interview and (ii) performing inference with predicted CODs (e.g. modeling the breakdown of causes by demographic factors using a sample of deaths). In this paper, we develop a method for valid inference using outcomes (in our case COD) predicted from free-form text using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. This method, which we call multiPPI++, extends recent work in ""prediction-powered inference"" to multinomial classification. We leverage a suite of NLP techniques for COD prediction and, through empirical analysis of VA data, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling transportability issues. multiPPI++ recovers ground truth estimates, regardless of which NLP model produced predictions and regardless of whether they were produced by a more accurate predictor like GPT-4-32k or a less accurate predictor like KNN. Our findings demonstrate the practical importance of inference correction for public health decision-making and suggests that if inference tasks are the end goal, having a small amount of contextually relevant, high quality labeled data is essential regardless of the NLP algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02438v1,2024-04
On the Multilingual Ability of Decoder-based Pre-trained Language Models: Finding and Controlling Language-Specific Neurons,"Takeshi Kojima, Itsuki Okimura, Yusuke Iwasawa, Hitomi Yanaka, Yutaka Matsuo","Current decoder-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) successfully demonstrate multilingual capabilities. However, it is unclear how these models handle multilingualism. We analyze the neuron-level internal behavior of multilingual decoder-based PLMs, Specifically examining the existence of neurons that fire ``uniquely for each language'' within decoder-only multilingual PLMs. We analyze six languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese, and show that language-specific neurons are unique, with a slight overlap (< 5%) between languages. These neurons are mainly distributed in the models' first and last few layers. This trend remains consistent across languages and models. Additionally, we tamper with less than 1% of the total neurons in each model during inference and demonstrate that tampering with a few language-specific neurons drastically changes the probability of target language occurrence in text generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02431v1,2024-04
Enhancing Low-Resource LLMs Classification with PEFT and Synthetic Data,"Parth Patwa, Simone Filice, Zhiyu Chen, Giuseppe Castellucci, Oleg Rokhlenko, Shervin Malmasi","Large Language Models (LLMs) operating in 0-shot or few-shot settings achieve competitive results in Text Classification tasks. In-Context Learning (ICL) typically achieves better accuracy than the 0-shot setting, but it pays in terms of efficiency, due to the longer input prompt. In this paper, we propose a strategy to make LLMs as efficient as 0-shot text classifiers, while getting comparable or better accuracy than ICL. Our solution targets the low resource setting, i.e., when only 4 examples per class are available. Using a single LLM and few-shot real data we perform a sequence of generation, filtering and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning steps to create a robust and efficient classifier. Experimental results show that our approach leads to competitive results on multiple text classification datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02422v1,2024-04
Similar Data Points Identification with LLM: A Human-in-the-loop Strategy Using Summarization and Hidden State Insights,"Xianlong Zeng, Yijing Gao, Fanghao Song, Ang Liu","This study introduces a simple yet effective method for identifying similar data points across non-free text domains, such as tabular and image data, using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our two-step approach involves data point summarization and hidden state extraction. Initially, data is condensed via summarization using an LLM, reducing complexity and highlighting essential information in sentences. Subsequently, the summarization sentences are fed through another LLM to extract hidden states, serving as compact, feature-rich representations. This approach leverages the advanced comprehension and generative capabilities of LLMs, offering a scalable and efficient strategy for similarity identification across diverse datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in identifying similar data points on multiple datasets.

Revisiting subword tokenization: A case study on affixal negation in large language models,"Thinh Hung Truong, Yulia Otmakhova, Karin Verspoor, Trevor Cohn, Timothy Baldwin","In this work, we measure the impact of affixal negation on modern English large language models (LLMs). In affixal negation, the negated meaning is expressed through a negative morpheme, which is potentially challenging for LLMs as their tokenizers are often not morphologically plausible. We conduct extensive experiments using LLMs with different subword tokenization methods, which lead to several insights on the interaction between tokenization performance and negation sensitivity. Despite some interesting mismatches between tokenization accuracy and negation detection performance, we show that models can, on the whole, reliably recognize the meaning of affixal negation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02421v2,2024-04
Auxiliary task demands mask the capabilities of smaller language models,"Jennifer Hu, Michael C. Frank","Developmental psychologists have argued about when cognitive capacities such as language understanding or theory of mind emerge. These debates often hinge on the concept of ""task demands"" -- the auxiliary challenges associated with performing a particular evaluation -- that may mask the child's underlying ability. The same issues arise when measuring the capacities of language models (LMs): performance on a task is a function of the model's underlying knowledge, combined with the model's ability to interpret and perform the task given its available resources. Here, we show that for analogical reasoning, reflective reasoning, word prediction, and grammaticality judgments, evaluation methods with greater task demands yield lower performance than evaluations with reduced demands. This ""demand gap"" is most pronounced for models with fewer parameters and less training data. Our results illustrate that LM performance should not be interpreted as a direct indication of intelligence (or lack thereof), but as a reflection of capacities seen through the lens of researchers' design choices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02418v2,2024-04
KnowHalu: Hallucination Detection via Multi-Form Knowledge Based Factual Checking,"Jiawei Zhang, Chejian Xu, Yu Gai, Freddy Lecue, Dawn Song, Bo Li","This paper introduces KnowHalu, a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in text generated by large language models (LLMs), utilizing step-wise reasoning, multi-formulation query, multi-form knowledge for factual checking, and fusion-based detection mechanism. As LLMs are increasingly applied across various domains, ensuring that their outputs are not hallucinated is critical. Recognizing the limitations of existing approaches that either rely on the self-consistency check of LLMs or perform post-hoc fact-checking without considering the complexity of queries or the form of knowledge, KnowHalu proposes a two-phase process for hallucination detection. In the first phase, it identifies non-fabrication hallucinations--responses that, while factually correct, are irrelevant or non-specific to the query. The second phase, multi-form based factual checking, contains five key steps: reasoning and query decomposition, knowledge retrieval, knowledge optimization, judgment generation, and judgment aggregation. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that KnowHalu significantly outperforms SOTA baselines in detecting hallucinations across diverse tasks, e.g., improving by 15.65% in QA tasks and 5.50% in summarization tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility in detecting hallucinations in LLM-generated content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02935v1,2024-04
CMULAB: An Open-Source Framework for Training and Deployment of Natural Language Processing Models,"Zaid Sheikh, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Shruti Rijhwani, Lindia Tjuatja, Robbie Jimerson, Graham Neubig","Effectively using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools in under-resourced languages requires a thorough understanding of the language itself, familiarity with the latest models and training methodologies, and technical expertise to deploy these models.

Exploring Backdoor Vulnerabilities of Chat Models,"Yunzhuo Hao, Wenkai Yang, Yankai Lin","Recent researches have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to a security threat known as Backdoor Attack. The backdoored model will behave well in normal cases but exhibit malicious behaviours on inputs inserted with a specific backdoor trigger. Current backdoor studies on LLMs predominantly focus on instruction-tuned LLMs, while neglecting another realistic scenario where LLMs are fine-tuned on multi-turn conversational data to be chat models. Chat models are extensively adopted across various real-world scenarios, thus the security of chat models deserves increasing attention. Unfortunately, we point out that the flexible multi-turn interaction format instead increases the flexibility of trigger designs and amplifies the vulnerability of chat models to backdoor attacks. In this work, we reveal and achieve a novel backdoor attacking method on chat models by distributing multiple trigger scenarios across user inputs in different rounds, and making the backdoor be triggered only when all trigger scenarios have appeared in the historical conversations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve high attack success rates (e.g., over 90% ASR on Vicuna-7B) while successfully maintaining the normal capabilities of chat models on providing helpful responses to benign user requests. Also, the backdoor can not be easily removed by the downstream re-alignment, highlighting the importance of continued research and attention to the security concerns of chat models.

GreedLlama: Performance of Financial Value-Aligned Large Language Models in Moral Reasoning,"Jeffy Yu, Maximilian Huber, Kevin Tang","This paper investigates the ethical implications of aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with financial optimization, through the case study of GreedLlama, a model fine-tuned to prioritize economically beneficial outcomes. By comparing GreedLlama's performance in moral reasoning tasks to a base Llama2 model, our results highlight a concerning trend: GreedLlama demonstrates a marked preference for profit over ethical considerations, making morally appropriate decisions at significantly lower rates than the base model in scenarios of both low and high moral ambiguity. In low ambiguity situations, GreedLlama's ethical decisions decreased to 54.4%, compared to the base model's 86.9%, while in high ambiguity contexts, the rate was 47.4% against the base model's 65.1%. These findings emphasize the risks of single-dimensional value alignment in LLMs, underscoring the need for integrating broader ethical values into AI development to ensure decisions are not solely driven by financial incentives. The study calls for a balanced approach to LLM deployment, advocating for the incorporation of ethical considerations in models intended for business applications, particularly in light of the absence of regulatory oversight.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02934v1,2024-04
Benchmarking Large Language Models for Persian: A Preliminary Study Focusing on ChatGPT,"Amirhossein Abaskohi, Sara Baruni, Mostafa Masoudi, Nesa Abbasi, Mohammad Hadi Babalou, Ali Edalat, Sepehr Kamahi, Samin Mahdizadeh Sani, Nikoo Naghavian, Danial Namazifard, Pouya Sadeghi, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh","This paper explores the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) for Persian. While ChatGPT and consequent LLMs have shown remarkable performance in English, their efficiency for more low-resource languages remains an open question. We present the first comprehensive benchmarking study of LLMs across diverse Persian language tasks. Our primary focus is on GPT-3.5-turbo, but we also include GPT-4 and OpenChat-3.5 to provide a more holistic evaluation. Our assessment encompasses a diverse set of tasks categorized into classic, reasoning, and knowledge-based domains. To enable a thorough comparison, we evaluate LLMs against existing task-specific fine-tuned models. Given the limited availability of Persian datasets for reasoning tasks, we introduce two new benchmarks: one based on elementary school math questions and another derived from the entrance exams for 7th and 10th grades. Our findings reveal that while LLMs, especially GPT-4, excel in tasks requiring reasoning abilities and a broad understanding of general knowledge, they often lag behind smaller pre-trained models fine-tuned specifically for particular tasks. Additionally, we observe improved performance when test sets are translated to English before inputting them into GPT-3.5. These results highlight the significant potential for enhancing LLM performance in the Persian language. This is particularly noteworthy due to the unique attributes of Persian, including its distinct alphabet and writing styles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02403v1,2024-04

Backdoor Attack on Multilingual Machine Translation,"Jun Wang, Qiongkai Xu, Xuanli He, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein, Trevor Cohn","While multilingual machine translation (MNMT) systems hold substantial promise, they also have security vulnerabilities. Our research highlights that MNMT systems can be susceptible to a particularly devious style of backdoor attack, whereby an attacker injects poisoned data into a low-resource language pair to cause malicious translations in other languages, including high-resource languages. Our experimental results reveal that injecting less than 0.01% poisoned data into a low-resource language pair can achieve an average 20% attack success rate in attacking high-resource language pairs. This type of attack is of particular concern, given the larger attack surface of languages inherent to low-resource settings. Our aim is to bring attention to these vulnerabilities within MNMT systems with the hope of encouraging the community to address security concerns in machine translation, especially in the context of low-resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02393v1,2024-04
Low-resource neural machine translation with morphological modeling,Antoine Nzeyimana,"Morphological modeling in neural machine translation (NMT) is a promising approach to achieving open-vocabulary machine translation for morphologically-rich languages. However, existing methods such as sub-word tokenization and character-based models are limited to the surface forms of the words. In this work, we propose a framework-solution for modeling complex morphology in low-resource settings. A two-tier transformer architecture is chosen to encode morphological information at the inputs. At the target-side output, a multi-task multi-label training scheme coupled with a beam search-based decoder are found to improve machine translation performance. An attention augmentation scheme to the transformer model is proposed in a generic form to allow integration of pre-trained language models and also facilitate modeling of word order relationships between the source and target languages. Several data augmentation techniques are evaluated and shown to increase translation performance in low-resource settings. We evaluate our proposed solution on Kinyarwanda - English translation using public-domain parallel text. Our final models achieve competitive performance in relation to large multi-lingual models. We hope that our results will motivate more use of explicit morphological information and the proposed model and data augmentations in low-resource NMT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02392v1,2024-04
On Linearizing Structured Data in Encoder-Decoder Language Models: Insights from Text-to-SQL,"Yutong Shao, Ndapa Nakashole","Structured data, prevalent in tables, databases, and knowledge graphs, poses a significant challenge in its representation. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there has been a shift towards linearization-based methods, which process structured data as sequential token streams, diverging from approaches that explicitly model structure, often as a graph. Crucially, there remains a gap in our understanding of how these linearization-based methods handle structured data, which is inherently non-linear. This work investigates the linear handling of structured data in encoder-decoder language models, specifically T5. Our findings reveal the model's ability to mimic human-designed processes such as schema linking and syntax prediction, indicating a deep, meaningful learning of structure beyond simple token sequencing. We also uncover insights into the model's internal mechanisms, including the ego-centric nature of structure node encodings and the potential for model compression due to modality fusion redundancy. Overall, this work sheds light on the inner workings of linearization-based methods and could potentially provide guidance for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02389v1,2024-04

Proficiency in database query languages is pivotal for crafting effective queries. As coding assistants become more prevalent, there is significant opportunity to enhance database query languages. The Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a widely used query language for large semi-structured data such as logs, telemetries, and time-series for big data analytics platforms. This paper introduces NL2KQL an innovative framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to convert natural language queries (NLQs) to KQL queries. The proposed NL2KQL framework includes several key components: Schema Refiner which narrows down the schema to its most pertinent elements; the Few-shot Selector which dynamically selects relevant examples from a few-shot dataset; and the Query Refiner which repairs syntactic and semantic errors in KQL queries. Additionally, this study outlines a method for generating large datasets of synthetic NLQ-KQL pairs which are valid within a specific database contexts. To validate NL2KQL's performance, we utilize an array of online (based on query execution) and offline (based on query parsing) metrics.

Obfuscated Malware Detection: Investigating Real-world Scenarios through Memory Analysis,"S M Rakib Hasan, Aakar Dhakal","In the era of the internet and smart devices, the detection of malware has become crucial for system security. Malware authors increasingly employ obfuscation techniques to evade advanced security solutions, making it challenging to detect and eliminate threats. Obfuscated malware, adept at hiding itself, poses a significant risk to various platforms, including computers, mobile devices, and IoT devices. Conventional methods like heuristic-based or signature-based systems struggle against this type of malware, as it leaves no discernible traces on the system. In this research, we propose a simple and cost-effective obfuscated malware detection system through memory dump analysis, utilizing diverse machine-learning algorithms. The study focuses on the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset, designed to simulate real-world scenarios and assess memory-based obfuscated malware detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, ensemble methods, and neural networks, in detecting obfuscated malware within memory dumps. Our analysis spans multiple malware categories, providing insights into algorithmic strengths and limitations. By offering a comprehensive assessment of machine learning algorithms for obfuscated malware detection through memory analysis, this paper contributes to ongoing efforts to enhance cybersecurity and fortify digital ecosystems against evolving and sophisticated malware threats.

Enhancing Human-Computer Interaction in Chest X-ray Analysis using Vision and Language Model with Eye Gaze Patterns,"Yunsoo Kim, Jinge Wu, Yusuf Abdulle, Yue Gao, Honghan Wu","Recent advancements in Computer Assisted Diagnosis have shown promising performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly in chest X-ray analysis. However, the interaction between these models and radiologists has been primarily limited to input images. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance human-computer interaction in chest X-ray analysis using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enhanced with radiologists' attention by incorporating eye gaze data alongside textual prompts. Our approach leverages heatmaps generated from eye gaze data, overlaying them onto medical images to highlight areas of intense radiologist's focus during chest X-ray evaluation. We evaluate this methodology in tasks such as visual question answering, chest X-ray report automation, error detection, and differential diagnosis. Our results demonstrate the inclusion of eye gaze information significantly enhances the accuracy of chest X-ray analysis. Also, the impact of eye gaze on fine-tuning was confirmed as it outperformed other medical VLMs in all tasks except visual question answering. This work marks the potential of leveraging both the VLM's capabilities and the radiologist's domain knowledge to improve the capabilities of AI models in medical imaging, paving a novel way for Computer Assisted Diagnosis with a human-centred AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02370v1,2024-04
Two Heads are Better than One: Nested PoE for Robust Defense Against Multi-Backdoors,"Victoria Graf, Qin Liu, Muhao Chen","Data poisoning backdoor attacks can cause undesirable behaviors in large language models (LLMs), and defending against them is of increasing importance. Existing defense mechanisms often assume that only one type of trigger is adopted by the attacker, while defending against multiple simultaneous and independent trigger types necessitates general defense frameworks and is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose Nested Product of Experts(NPoE) defense framework, which involves a mixture of experts (MoE) as a trigger-only ensemble within the PoE defense framework to simultaneously defend against multiple trigger types. During NPoE training, the main model is trained in an ensemble with a mixture of smaller expert models that learn the features of backdoor triggers. At inference time, only the main model is used. Experimental results on sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and question classification tasks demonstrate that NPoE effectively defends against a variety of triggers both separately and in trigger mixtures. Due to the versatility of the MoE structure in NPoE, this framework can be further expanded to defend against other attack settings",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02356v1,2024-04
A Computational Analysis of Lyric Similarity Perception,"Haven Kim, Taketo Akama","In musical compositions that include vocals, lyrics significantly contribute to artistic expression. Consequently, previous studies have introduced the concept of a recommendation system that suggests lyrics similar to a user's favorites or personalized preferences, aiding in the discovery of lyrics among millions of tracks. However, many of these systems do not fully consider human perceptions of lyric similarity, primarily due to limited research in this area. To bridge this gap, we conducted a comparative analysis of computational methods for modeling lyric similarity with human perception. Results indicated that computational models based on similarities between embeddings from pre-trained BERT-based models, the audio from which the lyrics are derived, and phonetic components are indicative of perceptual lyric similarity. This finding underscores the importance of semantic, stylistic, and phonetic similarities in human perception about lyric similarity. We anticipate that our findings will enhance the development of similarity-based lyric recommendation systems by offering pseudo-labels for neural network development and introducing objective evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02342v2,2024-04
Corpus Considerations for Annotator Modeling and Scaling,"Olufunke O. Sarumi, Béla Neuendorf, Joan Plepi, Lucie Flek, Jörg Schlötterer, Charles Welch","Recent trends in natural language processing research and annotation tasks affirm a paradigm shift from the traditional reliance on a single ground truth to a focus on individual perspectives, particularly in subjective tasks. In scenarios where annotation tasks are meant to encompass diversity, models that solely rely on the majority class labels may inadvertently disregard valuable minority perspectives. This oversight could result in the omission of crucial information and, in a broader context, risk disrupting the balance within larger ecosystems. As the landscape of annotator modeling unfolds with diverse representation techniques, it becomes imperative to investigate their effectiveness with the fine-grained features of the datasets in view. This study systematically explores various annotator modeling techniques and compares their performance across seven corpora.   From our findings, we show that the commonly used user token model consistently outperforms more complex models. We introduce a composite embedding approach and show distinct differences in which model performs best as a function of the agreement with a given dataset.

Multi-BERT: Leveraging Adapters and Prompt Tuning for Low-Resource Multi-Domain Adaptation,"Parham Abed Azad, Hamid Beigy","The rapid expansion of texts' volume and diversity presents formidable challenges in multi-domain settings. These challenges are also visible in the Persian name entity recognition (NER) settings. Traditional approaches, either employing a unified model for multiple domains or individual models for each domain, frequently pose significant limitations. Single models often struggle to capture the nuances of diverse domains, while utilizing multiple large models can lead to resource constraints, rendering the training of a model for each domain virtually impractical. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel approach composed of one core model with multiple sets of domain-specific parameters. We utilize techniques such as prompt tuning and adapters, combined with the incorporation of additional layers, to add parameters that we can train for the specific domains. This enables the model to perform comparably to individual models for each domain. Experimental results on different formal and informal datasets show that by employing these added parameters, the proposed model significantly surpasses existing practical models in performance. Remarkably, the proposed model requires only one instance for training and storage, yet achieves outstanding results across all domains, even surpassing the state-of-the-art in some. Moreover, we analyze each adaptation strategy, delineating its strengths, weaknesses, and optimal hyper-parameters for the Persian NER settings. Finally, we introduce a document-based domain detection pipeline tailored for scenarios with unknown text domains, enhancing the adaptability and practicality of this paper in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02335v1,2024-04
Comparative Study of Domain Driven Terms Extraction Using Large Language Models,"Sandeep Chataut, Tuyen Do, Bichar Dip Shrestha Gurung, Shiva Aryal, Anup Khanal, Carol Lushbough, Etienne Gnimpieba","Keywords play a crucial role in bridging the gap between human understanding and machine processing of textual data. They are essential to data enrichment because they form the basis for detailed annotations that provide a more insightful and in-depth view of the underlying data. Keyword/domain driven term extraction is a pivotal task in natural language processing, facilitating information retrieval, document summarization, and content categorization. This review focuses on keyword extraction methods, emphasizing the use of three major Large Language Models(LLMs): Llama2-7B, GPT-3.5, and Falcon-7B. We employed a custom Python package to interface with these LLMs, simplifying keyword extraction. Our study, utilizing the Inspec and PubMed datasets, evaluates the performance of these models. The Jaccard similarity index was used for assessment, yielding scores of 0.64 (Inspec) and 0.21 (PubMed) for GPT-3.5, 0.40 and 0.17 for Llama2-7B, and 0.23 and 0.12 for Falcon-7B.

Toward Informal Language Processing: Knowledge of Slang in Large Language Models,"Zhewei Sun, Qian Hu, Rahul Gupta, Richard Zemel, Yang Xu","Recent advancement in large language models (LLMs) has offered a strong potential for natural language systems to process informal language. A representative form of informal language is slang, used commonly in daily conversations and online social media. To date, slang has not been comprehensively evaluated in LLMs due partly to the absence of a carefully designed and publicly accessible benchmark. Using movie subtitles, we construct a dataset that supports evaluation on a diverse set of tasks pertaining to automatic processing of slang. For both evaluation and finetuning, we show the effectiveness of our dataset on two core applications: 1) slang detection, and 2) identification of regional and historical sources of slang from natural sentences. We also show how our dataset can be used to probe the output distributions of LLMs for interpretive insights. We find that while LLMs such as GPT-4 achieve good performance in a zero-shot setting, smaller BERT-like models finetuned on our dataset achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we show that our dataset enables finetuning of LLMs such as GPT-3.5 that achieve substantially better performance than strong zero-shot baselines. Our work offers a comprehensive evaluation and a high-quality benchmark on English slang based on the OpenSubtitles corpus, serving both as a publicly accessible resource and a platform for applying tools for informal language processing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02323v2,2024-04
Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization,"Tobias Schnabel, Jennifer Neville","In many modern LLM applications, such as retrieval augmented generation, prompts have become programs themselves. In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed.   We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02319v2,2024-04

Specifically, we explore the potential of self-training models on their own outputs, akin to how humans learn and build on their previous thoughts and actions. While this approach is intuitively appealing, our research reveals its practical limitations.

Enhancing Inference Efficiency of Large Language Models: Investigating Optimization Strategies and Architectural Innovations,Georgy Tyukin,"Large Language Models are growing in size, and we expect them to continue to do so, as larger models train quicker. However, this increase in size will severely impact inference costs. Therefore model compression is important, to retain the performance of larger models, but with a reduced cost of running them. In this thesis we explore the methods of model compression, and we empirically demonstrate that the simple method of skipping latter attention sublayers in Transformer LLMs is an effective method of model compression, as these layers prove to be redundant, whilst also being incredibly computationally expensive. We observed a 21% speed increase in one-token generation for Llama 2 7B, whilst surprisingly and unexpectedly improving performance over several common benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05741v1,2024-04
Extracting Norms from Contracts Via ChatGPT: Opportunities and Challenges,"Amanul Haque, Munindar P. Singh","We investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT in extracting norms from contracts. Norms provide a natural way to engineer multiagent systems by capturing how to govern the interactions between two or more autonomous parties. We extract norms of commitment, prohibition, authorization, and power, along with associated norm elements (the parties involved, antecedents, and consequents) from contracts. Our investigation reveals ChatGPT's effectiveness and limitations in norm extraction from contracts. ChatGPT demonstrates promising performance in norm extraction without requiring training or fine-tuning, thus obviating the need for annotated data, which is not generally available in this domain. However, we found some limitations of ChatGPT in extracting these norms that lead to incorrect norm extractions. The limitations include oversight of crucial details, hallucination, incorrect parsing of conjunctions, and empty norm elements. Enhanced norm extraction from contracts can foster the development of more transparent and trustworthy formal agent interaction specifications, thereby contributing to the improvement of multiagent systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02269v1,2024-04
Large Language Models as Planning Domain Generators,"James Oswald, Kavitha Srinivas, Harsha Kokel, Junkyu Lee, Michael Katz, Shirin Sohrabi","Developing domain models is one of the few remaining places that require manual human labor in AI planning. Thus, in order to make planning more accessible, it is desirable to automate the process of domain model generation. To this end, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate planning domain models from simple textual descriptions. Specifically, we introduce a framework for automated evaluation of LLM-generated domains by comparing the sets of plans for domain instances. Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of 7 large language models, including coding and chat models across 9 different planning domains, and under three classes of natural language domain descriptions. Our results indicate that LLMs, particularly those with high parameter counts, exhibit a moderate level of proficiency in generating correct planning domains from natural language descriptions.

LLMs in the Loop: Leveraging Large Language Model Annotations for Active Learning in Low-Resource Languages,"Nataliia Kholodna, Sahib Julka, Mohammad Khodadadi, Muhammed Nurullah Gumus, Michael Granitzer","Low-resource languages face significant barriers in AI development due to limited linguistic resources and expertise for data labeling, rendering them rare and costly. The scarcity of data and the absence of preexisting tools exacerbate these challenges, especially since these languages may not be adequately represented in various NLP datasets. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the potential of LLMs in the active learning loop for data annotation. Initially, we conduct evaluations to assess inter-annotator agreement and consistency, facilitating the selection of a suitable LLM annotator. The chosen annotator is then integrated into a training loop for a classifier using an active learning paradigm, minimizing the amount of queried data required. Empirical evaluations, notably employing GPT-4-Turbo, demonstrate near-state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced data requirements, as indicated by estimated potential cost savings of at least 42.45 times compared to human annotation. Our proposed solution shows promising potential to substantially reduce both the monetary and computational costs associated with automation in low-resource settings. By bridging the gap between low-resource languages and AI, this approach fosters broader inclusion and shows the potential to enable automation across diverse linguistic landscapes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02261v2,2024-04
Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating compute in transformer-based language models,"David Raposo, Sam Ritter, Blake Richards, Timothy Lillicrap, Peter Conway Humphreys, Adam Santoro","Transformer-based language models spread FLOPs uniformly across input sequences. In this work we demonstrate that transformers can instead learn to dynamically allocate FLOPs (or compute) to specific positions in a sequence, optimising the allocation along the sequence for different layers across the model depth. Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens ($k$) that can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed are determined by the network using a top-$k$ routing mechanism. Since $k$ is defined a priori, this simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the $k$ tokens are fluid, this method can expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50\% faster to step during post-training sampling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02258v1,2024-04
$\texttt{LM}^\texttt{2}$: A Simple Society of Language Models Solves Complex Reasoning,"Gurusha Juneja, Subhabrata Dutta, Tanmoy Chakraborty","Despite demonstrating emergent reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMS) often lose track of complex, multi-step reasoning. Existing studies show that providing guidance via decomposing the original question into multiple subproblems elicits more robustness in LLM reasoning -- a decomposer generates the subproblems, and a solver solves each of these subproblems. However, these techniques fail to accommodate coordination between the decomposer and the solver modules (either in a single model or different specialized ones) -- the decomposer does not keep track of the ability of the solver to follow the decomposed reasoning. In this paper, we propose LM2 to address these challenges. LM2 modularizes the decomposition, solution, and verification into three different language models. The decomposer module identifies the key concepts necessary to solve the problem and generates step-by-step subquestions according to the reasoning requirement. The solver model generates the solution to the subproblems that are then checked by the verifier module; depending upon the feedback from the verifier, the reasoning context is constructed using the subproblems and the solutions. These models are trained to coordinate using policy learning. Exhaustive experimentation suggests the superiority of LM2 over existing methods on in- and out-domain reasoning problems, outperforming the best baselines by $8.1\%$ on MATH, $7.71\%$ on JEEBench, and $9.7\%$ on MedQA problems (code available at https://github.com/LCS2-IIITD/Language_Model_Multiplex).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02255v1,2024-04
Emergent Abilities in Reduced-Scale Generative Language Models,"Sherin Muckatira, Vijeta Deshpande, Vladislav Lialin, Anna Rumshisky","Large language models can solve new tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. This ability, also known as in-context learning (ICL), is considered an emergent ability and is primarily seen in large language models with billions of parameters. This study investigates if such emergent properties are strictly tied to model size or can be demonstrated by smaller models trained on reduced-scale data. To explore this, we simplify pre-training data and pre-train 36 causal language models with parameters varying from 1 million to 165 million parameters. We show that models trained on this simplified pre-training data demonstrate enhanced zero-shot capabilities across various tasks in simplified language, achieving performance comparable to that of pre-trained models six times larger on unrestricted language. This suggests that downscaling the language allows zero-shot learning capabilities to emerge in models with limited size. Additionally, we find that these smaller models pre-trained on simplified data demonstrate a power law relationship between the evaluation loss and the three scaling factors: compute, dataset size, and model size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02204v1,2024-04
Topic-Based Watermarks for LLM-Generated Text,"Alexander Nemecek, Yuzhou Jiang, Erman Ayday","The indistinguishability of text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-generated text poses significant challenges. Watermarking algorithms are potential solutions by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generated outputs. However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness to a range of attacks such as text substitution or manipulation, undermining their reliability. This paper proposes a novel topic-based watermarking algorithm for LLMs, designed to enhance the robustness of watermarking in LLMs. Our approach leverages the topics extracted from input prompts or outputs of non-watermarked LLMs in the generation process of watermarked text. We dynamically utilize token lists on identified topics and adjust token sampling weights accordingly. By using these topic-specific token biases, we embed a topic-sensitive watermarking into the generated text. We outline the theoretical framework of our topic-based watermarking algorithm and discuss its potential advantages in various scenarios. Additionally, we explore a comprehensive range of attacks against watermarking algorithms, including discrete alterations, paraphrasing, and tokenizations. We demonstrate that our proposed watermarking scheme classifies various watermarked text topics with 99.99% confidence and outperforms existing algorithms in terms of z-score robustness and the feasibility of modeling text degradation by potential attackers, while considering the trade-offs between the benefits and losses of watermarking LLM-generated text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02138v3,2024-04
FLawN-T5: An Empirical Examination of Effective Instruction-Tuning Data Mixtures for Legal Reasoning,"Joel Niklaus, Lucia Zheng, Arya D. McCarthy, Christopher Hahn, Brian M. Rosen, Peter Henderson, Daniel E. Ho, Garrett Honke, Percy Liang, Christopher Manning","Instruction tuning is an important step in making language models useful for direct user interaction. However, many legal tasks remain out of reach for most open LLMs and there do not yet exist any large scale instruction datasets for the domain. This critically limits research in this application area. In this work, we curate LawInstruct, a large legal instruction dataset, covering 17 jurisdictions, 24 languages and a total of 12M examples. We present evidence that domain-specific pretraining and instruction tuning improve performance on LegalBench, including improving Flan-T5 XL by 8 points or 16\% over the baseline. However, the effect does not generalize across all tasks, training regimes, model sizes, and other factors. LawInstruct is a resource for accelerating the development of models with stronger information processing and decision making capabilities in the legal domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02127v1,2024-04
Rematch: Robust and Efficient Matching of Local Knowledge Graphs to Improve Structural and Semantic Similarity,"Zoher Kachwala, Jisun An, Haewoon Kwak, Filippo Menczer","Knowledge graphs play a pivotal role in various applications, such as question-answering and fact-checking. Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) represents text as knowledge graphs. Evaluating the quality of these graphs involves matching them structurally to each other and semantically to the source text. Existing AMR metrics are inefficient and struggle to capture semantic similarity. We also lack a systematic evaluation benchmark for assessing structural similarity between AMR graphs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel AMR similarity metric, rematch, alongside a new evaluation for structural similarity called RARE. Among state-of-the-art metrics, rematch ranks second in structural similarity; and first in semantic similarity by 1--5 percentage points on the STS-B and SICK-R benchmarks. Rematch is also five times faster than the next most efficient metric.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02126v1,2024-04
Exploring Automated Distractor Generation for Math Multiple-choice Questions via Large Language Models,"Wanyong Feng, Jaewook Lee, Hunter McNichols, Alexander Scarlatos, Digory Smith, Simon Woodhead, Nancy Otero Ornelas, Andrew Lan","Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are ubiquitous in almost all levels of education since they are easy to administer, grade, and are a reliable format in assessments and practices. One of the most important aspects of MCQs is the distractors, i.e., incorrect options that are designed to target common errors or misconceptions among real students. To date, the task of crafting high-quality distractors largely remains a labor and time-intensive process for teachers and learning content designers, which has limited scalability. In this work, we study the task of automated distractor generation in the domain of math MCQs and explore a wide variety of large language model (LLM)-based approaches, from in-context learning to fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using a real-world math MCQ dataset and find that although LLMs can generate some mathematically valid distractors, they are less adept at anticipating common errors or misconceptions among real students.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02124v3,2024-04

However, they often neglect the intrinsic informational value conveyed by mutual dependencies between words. In this study, we introduce GINopic, a topic modeling framework based on graph isomorphism networks to capture the correlation between words. By conducting intrinsic (quantitative as well as qualitative) and extrinsic evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GINopic compared to existing topic models and highlight its potential for advancing topic modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02115v2,2024-04
CLAPNQ: Cohesive Long-form Answers from Passages in Natural Questions for RAG systems,"Sara Rosenthal, Avirup Sil, Radu Florian, Salim Roukos","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular application for large language models. It is preferable that successful RAG systems provide accurate answers that are supported by being grounded in a passage without any hallucinations. While considerable work is required for building a full RAG pipeline, being able to benchmark performance is also necessary. We present ClapNQ, a benchmark Long-form Question Answering dataset for the full RAG pipeline. ClapNQ includes long answers with grounded gold passages from Natural Questions (NQ) and a corpus to perform either retrieval, generation, or the full RAG pipeline. The ClapNQ answers are concise, 3x smaller than the full passage, and cohesive, meaning that the answer is composed fluently, often by integrating multiple pieces of the passage that are not contiguous. RAG models must adapt to these properties to be successful at ClapNQ. We present baseline experiments and analysis for ClapNQ that highlight areas where there is still significant room for improvement in grounded RAG.

READ: Improving Relation Extraction from an ADversarial Perspective,"Dawei Li, William Hogan, Jingbo Shang","Recent works in relation extraction (RE) have achieved promising benchmark accuracy; however, our adversarial attack experiments show that these works excessively rely on entities, making their generalization capability questionable. To address this issue, we propose an adversarial training method specifically designed for RE. Our approach introduces both sequence- and token-level perturbations to the sample and uses a separate perturbation vocabulary to improve the search for entity and context perturbations. Furthermore, we introduce a probabilistic strategy for leaving clean tokens in the context during adversarial training. This strategy enables a larger attack budget for entities and coaxes the model to leverage relational patterns embedded in the context. Extensive experiments show that compared to various adversarial training methods, our method significantly improves both the accuracy and robustness of the model. Additionally, experiments on different data availability settings highlight the effectiveness of our method in low-resource scenarios. We also perform in-depth analyses of our proposed method and provide further hints. We will release our code at https://github.com/David-Li0406/READ.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02931v1,2024-04
LastResort at SemEval-2024 Task 3: Exploring Multimodal Emotion Cause Pair Extraction as Sequence Labelling Task,"Suyash Vardhan Mathur, Akshett Rai Jindal, Hardik Mittal, Manish Shrivastava","Conversation is the most natural form of human communication, where each utterance can range over a variety of possible emotions. While significant work has been done towards the detection of emotions in text, relatively little work has been done towards finding the cause of the said emotions, especially in multimodal settings. SemEval 2024 introduces the task of Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations, which aims to extract emotions reflected in individual utterances in a conversation involving multiple modalities (textual, audio, and visual modalities) along with the corresponding utterances that were the cause for the emotion. In this paper, we propose models that tackle this task as an utterance labeling and a sequence labeling problem and perform a comparative study of these models, involving baselines using different encoders, using BiLSTM for adding contextual information of the conversation, and finally adding a CRF layer to try to model the inter-dependencies between adjacent utterances more effectively. In the official leaderboard for the task, our architecture was ranked 8th, achieving an F1-score of 0.1759 on the leaderboard.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02088v1,2024-04
Advancing LLM Reasoning Generalists with Preference Trees,"Lifan Yuan, Ganqu Cui, Hanbin Wang, Ning Ding, Xingyao Wang, Jia Deng, Boji Shan, Huimin Chen, Ruobing Xie, Yankai Lin, Zhenghao Liu, Bowen Zhou, Hao Peng, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","We introduce Eurus, a suite of large language models (LLMs) optimized for reasoning. Finetuned from Mistral-7B and CodeLlama-70B, Eurus models achieve state-of-the-art results among open-source models on a diverse set of benchmarks covering mathematics, code generation, and logical reasoning problems. Notably, Eurus-70B beats GPT-3.5 Turbo in reasoning through a comprehensive benchmarking across 12 tests covering five tasks, and achieves a 33.3% pass@1 accuracy on LeetCode and 32.6% on TheoremQA, two challenging benchmarks, substantially outperforming existing open-source models by margins more than 13.3%. The strong performance of Eurus can be primarily attributed to UltraInteract, our newly-curated large-scale, high-quality alignment dataset specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. UltraInteract can be used in both supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. For each instruction, it includes a preference tree consisting of (1) reasoning chains with diverse planning strategies in a unified format, (2) multi-turn interaction trajectories with the environment and the critique, and (3) pairwise data to facilitate preference learning. UltraInteract allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of preference learning for reasoning tasks. Our investigation reveals that some well-established preference learning algorithms may be less suitable for reasoning tasks compared to their effectiveness in general conversations. Inspired by this, we derive a novel reward modeling objective which, together with UltraInteract, leads to a strong reward model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02078v1,2024-04
Using Interpretation Methods for Model Enhancement,"Zhuo Chen, Chengyue Jiang, Kewei Tu","In the age of neural natural language processing, there are plenty of works trying to derive interpretations of neural models. Intuitively, when gold rationales exist during training, one can additionally train the model to match its interpretation with the rationales. However, this intuitive idea has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a framework of utilizing interpretation methods and gold rationales to enhance models. Our framework is very general in the sense that it can incorporate various interpretation methods. Previously proposed gradient-based methods can be shown as an instance of our framework. We also propose two novel instances utilizing two other types of interpretation methods, erasure/replace-based and extractor-based methods, for model enhancement. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of tasks. Experimental results show that our framework is effective especially in low-resource settings in enhancing models with various interpretation methods, and our two newly-proposed methods outperform gradient-based methods in most settings.

Long-context LLMs Struggle with Long In-context Learning,"Tianle Li, Ge Zhang, Quy Duc Do, Xiang Yue, Wenhu Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in handling long sequences. Some models like Gemini could even to be capable of dealing with millions of tokens. However, their performance evaluation has largely been confined to metrics like perplexity and synthetic tasks, which may not fully capture their true abilities in more challenging, real-world scenarios. We introduce a benchmark (LongICLBench) for long in-context learning in extreme-label classification using six datasets with 28 to 174 classes and input lengths from 2K to 50K tokens. Our benchmark requires LLMs to comprehend the entire input to recognize the massive label spaces to make correct predictions. We evaluate on 15 long-context LLMs and find that they perform well on less challenging classification tasks with smaller label space and shorter demonstrations. However, they struggle with more challenging task like Discovery with 174 labels, suggesting a gap in their ability to process long, context-rich sequences. Further analysis reveals a bias towards labels presented later in the sequence and a need for improved reasoning over multiple pieces of information. Our study reveals that long context understanding and reasoning is still a challenging task for the existing LLMs. We believe LongICLBench could serve as a more realistic evaluation for the future long-context LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02060v3,2024-04
Deconstructing In-Context Learning: Understanding Prompts via Corruption,"Namrata Shivagunde, Vladislav Lialin, Sherin Muckatira, Anna Rumshisky","The ability of large language models (LLMs) to $``$learn in context$""$ based on the provided prompt has led to an explosive growth in their use, culminating in the proliferation of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard. These AI assistants are known to be robust to minor prompt modifications, mostly due to alignment techniques that use human feedback. In contrast, the underlying pre-trained LLMs they use as a backbone are known to be brittle in this respect. Building high-quality backbone models remains a core challenge, and a common approach to assessing their quality is to conduct few-shot evaluation. Such evaluation is notorious for being highly sensitive to minor prompt modifications, as well as the choice of specific in-context examples. Prior work has examined how modifying different elements of the prompt can affect model performance. However, these earlier studies tended to concentrate on a limited number of specific prompt attributes and often produced contradictory results. Additionally, previous research either focused on models with fewer than 15 billion parameters or exclusively examined black-box models like GPT-3 or PaLM, making replication challenging. In the present study, we decompose the entire prompt into four components: task description, demonstration inputs, labels, and inline instructions provided for each demonstration. We investigate the effects of structural and semantic corruptions of these elements on model performance. We study models ranging from 1.5B to 70B in size, using ten datasets covering classification and generation tasks. We find that repeating text within the prompt boosts model performance, and bigger models ($\geq$30B) are more sensitive to the semantics of the prompt. Finally, we observe that adding task and inline instructions to the demonstrations enhances model performance even when the instructions are semantically corrupted.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02054v2,2024-04
BERTopic-Driven Stock Market Predictions: Unraveling Sentiment Insights,"Enmin Zhu, Jerome Yen","This paper explores the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and financial analysis, focusing on the impact of sentiment analysis in stock price prediction. We employ BERTopic, an advanced NLP technique, to analyze the sentiment of topics derived from stock market comments. Our methodology integrates this sentiment analysis with various deep learning models, renowned for their effectiveness in time series and stock prediction tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that incorporating topic sentiment notably enhances the performance of these models. The results indicate that topics in stock market comments provide implicit, valuable insights into stock market volatility and price trends. This study contributes to the field by showcasing the potential of NLP in enriching financial analysis and opens up avenues for further research into real-time sentiment analysis and the exploration of emotional and contextual aspects of market sentiment.

In this work, we leverage the state-of-the-art advances in NLP, exploring cross-lingual knowledge transfer methods avoiding manual data curation: large multilingual encoders and translation systems, LLMs, and language adapters.

MultiParaDetox: Extending Text Detoxification with Parallel Data to New Languages,"Daryna Dementieva, Nikolay Babakov, Alexander Panchenko","Text detoxification is a textual style transfer (TST) task where a text is paraphrased from a toxic surface form, e.g. featuring rude words, to the neutral register. Recently, text detoxification methods found their applications in various task such as detoxification of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Leong et al., 2023; He et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2023) and toxic speech combating in social networks (Deng et al., 2023; Mun et al., 2023; Agarwal et al., 2023). All these applications are extremely important to ensure safe communication in modern digital worlds. However, the previous approaches for parallel text detoxification corpora collection -- ParaDetox (Logacheva et al., 2022) and APPADIA (Atwell et al., 2022) -- were explored only in monolingual setup. In this work, we aim to extend ParaDetox pipeline to multiple languages presenting MultiParaDetox to automate parallel detoxification corpus collection for potentially any language. Then, we experiment with different text detoxification models -- from unsupervised baselines to LLMs and fine-tuned models on the presented parallel corpora -- showing the great benefit of parallel corpus presence to obtain state-of-the-art text detoxification models for any language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02037v1,2024-04
Improving Retrieval Augmented Open-Domain Question-Answering with Vectorized Contexts,"Zhuo Chen, Xinyu Wang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Kewei Tu","In the era of large language models, applying techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation can better address Open-Domain Question-Answering problems. Due to constraints including model sizes and computing resources, the length of context is often limited, and it becomes challenging to empower the model to cover overlong contexts while answering questions from open domains. This paper proposes a general and convenient method to covering longer contexts in Open-Domain Question-Answering tasks. It leverages a small encoder language model that effectively encodes contexts, and the encoding applies cross-attention with origin inputs. With our method, the origin language models can cover several times longer contexts while keeping the computing requirements close to the baseline.

Risks from Language Models for Automated Mental Healthcare: Ethics and Structure for Implementation,"Declan Grabb, Max Lamparth, Nina Vasan","Amidst the growing interest in developing task-autonomous AI for automated mental health care, this paper addresses the ethical and practical challenges associated with the issue and proposes a structured framework that delineates levels of autonomy, outlines ethical requirements, and defines beneficial default behaviors for AI agents in the context of mental health support. We also evaluate fourteen state-of-the-art language models (ten off-the-shelf, four fine-tuned) using 16 mental health-related questionnaires designed to reflect various mental health conditions, such as psychosis, mania, depression, suicidal thoughts, and homicidal tendencies. The questionnaire design and response evaluations were conducted by mental health clinicians (M.D.s). We find that existing language models are insufficient to match the standard provided by human professionals who can navigate nuances and appreciate context. This is due to a range of issues, including overly cautious or sycophantic responses and the absence of necessary safeguards. Alarmingly, we find that most of the tested models could cause harm if accessed in mental health emergencies, failing to protect users and potentially exacerbating existing symptoms. We explore solutions to enhance the safety of current models. Before the release of increasingly task-autonomous AI systems in mental health, it is crucial to ensure that these models can reliably detect and manage symptoms of common psychiatric disorders to prevent harm to users. This involves aligning with the ethical framework and default behaviors outlined in our study. We contend that model developers are responsible for refining their systems per these guidelines to safeguard against the risks posed by current AI technologies to user mental health and safety.

Detecting such abusive content can enable platforms to curb this menace. We participated in the Gendered Abuse Detection in Indic Languages shared task at ICON2023 that provided datasets of annotated Twitter posts in English, Hindi and Tamil for building classifiers to identify gendered abuse. Our team CNLP-NITS-PP developed an ensemble approach combining CNN and BiLSTM networks that can effectively model semantic and sequential patterns in textual data. The CNN captures localized features indicative of abusive language through its convolution filters applied on embedded input text. To determine context-based offensiveness, the BiLSTM analyzes this sequence for dependencies among words and phrases. Multiple variations were trained using FastText and GloVe word embeddings for each language dataset comprising over 7,600 crowdsourced annotations across labels for explicit abuse, targeted minority attacks and general offences. The validation scores showed strong performance across f1-measures, especially for English 0.84. Our experiments reveal how customizing embeddings and model hyperparameters can improve detection capability.

DELAN: Dual-Level Alignment for Vision-and-Language Navigation by Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning,"Mengfei Du, Binhao Wu, Jiwen Zhang, Zhihao Fan, Zejun Li, Ruipu Luo, Xuanjing Huang, Zhongyu Wei","Vision-and-Language navigation (VLN) requires an agent to navigate in unseen environment by following natural language instruction. For task completion, the agent needs to align and integrate various navigation modalities, including instruction, observation and navigation history. Existing works primarily concentrate on cross-modal attention at the fusion stage to achieve this objective. Nevertheless, modality features generated by disparate uni-encoders reside in their own spaces, leading to a decline in the quality of cross-modal fusion and decision. To address this problem, we propose a Dual-levEL AligNment (DELAN) framework by cross-modal contrastive learning. This framework is designed to align various navigation-related modalities before fusion, thereby enhancing cross-modal interaction and action decision-making. Specifically, we divide the pre-fusion alignment into dual levels: instruction-history level and landmark-observation level according to their semantic correlations. We also reconstruct a dual-level instruction for adaptation to the dual-level alignment. As the training signals for pre-fusion alignment are extremely limited, self-supervised contrastive learning strategies are employed to enforce the matching between different modalities. Our approach seamlessly integrates with the majority of existing models, resulting in improved navigation performance on various VLN benchmarks, including R2R, R4R, RxR and CVDN.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01994v1,2024-04
Dissecting Paraphrases: The Impact of Prompt Syntax and supplementary Information on Knowledge Retrieval from Pretrained Language Models,"Stephan Linzbach, Dimitar Dimitrov, Laura Kallmeyer, Kilian Evang, Hajira Jabeen, Stefan Dietze","Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are known to contain various kinds of knowledge. One method to infer relational knowledge is through the use of cloze-style prompts, where a model is tasked to predict missing subjects or objects. Typically, designing these prompts is a tedious task because small differences in syntax or semantics can have a substantial impact on knowledge retrieval performance. Simultaneously, evaluating the impact of either prompt syntax or information is challenging due to their interdependence. We designed CONPARE-LAMA - a dedicated probe, consisting of 34 million distinct prompts that facilitate comparison across minimal paraphrases. These paraphrases follow a unified meta-template enabling the controlled variation of syntax and semantics across arbitrary relations. CONPARE-LAMA enables insights into the independent impact of either syntactical form or semantic information of paraphrases on the knowledge retrieval performance of PLMs. Extensive knowledge retrieval experiments using our probe reveal that prompts following clausal syntax have several desirable properties in comparison to appositive syntax: i) they are more useful when querying PLMs with a combination of supplementary information, ii) knowledge is more consistently recalled across different combinations of supplementary information, and iii) they decrease response uncertainty when retrieving known facts. In addition, range information can boost knowledge retrieval performance more than domain information, even though domain information is more reliably helpful across syntactic forms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01992v1,2024-04

Classifying Graphemes in English Words Through the Application of a Fuzzy Inference System,"Samuel Rose, Chandrasekhar Kambhampati","In Linguistics, a grapheme is a written unit of a writing system corresponding to a phonological sound. In Natural Language Processing tasks, written language is analysed through two different mediums, word analysis, and character analysis. This paper focuses on a third approach, the analysis of graphemes. Graphemes have advantages over word and character analysis by being self-contained representations of phonetic sounds. Due to the nature of splitting a word into graphemes being based on complex, non-binary rules, the application of fuzzy logic would provide a suitable medium upon which to predict the number of graphemes in a word. This paper proposes the application of a Fuzzy Inference System to split words into their graphemes. This Fuzzy Inference System results in a correct prediction of the number of graphemes in a word 50.18% of the time, with 93.51% being within a margin of +- 1 from the correct classification. Given the variety in language, graphemes are tied with pronunciation and therefore can change depending on a regional accent/dialect, the +- 1 accuracy represents the impreciseness of grapheme classification when regional variances are accounted for. To give a baseline of comparison, a second method involving a recursive IPA mapping exercise using a pronunciation dictionary was developed to allow for comparisons to be made.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01953v1,2024-04
Self-Organized Agents: A LLM Multi-Agent Framework toward Ultra Large-Scale Code Generation and Optimization,"Yoichi Ishibashi, Yoshimasa Nishimura","Recent advancements in automatic code generation using large language model (LLM) agent have brought us closer to the future of automated software development. However, existing single-agent approaches face limitations in generating and improving large-scale, complex codebases due to constraints in context length. To tackle this challenge, we propose Self-Organized multi-Agent framework (SoA), a novel multi-agent framework that enables the scalable and efficient generation and optimization of large-scale code. In SoA, self-organized agents operate independently to generate and modify code components while seamlessly collaborating to construct the overall codebase. A key feature of our framework is the automatic multiplication of agents based on problem complexity, allowing for dynamic scalability. This enables the overall code volume to be increased indefinitely according to the number of agents, while the amount of code managed by each agent remains constant. We evaluate SoA on the HumanEval benchmark and demonstrate that, compared to a single-agent system, each agent in SoA handles significantly less code, yet the overall generated code is substantially greater. Moreover, SoA surpasses the powerful single-agent baseline by 5% in terms of Pass@1 accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02183v1,2024-04
Towards Better Understanding of Cybercrime: The Role of Fine-Tuned LLMs in Translation,"Veronica Valeros, Anna Širokova, Carlos Catania, Sebastian Garcia","Understanding cybercrime communications is paramount for cybersecurity defence. This often involves translating communications into English for processing, interpreting, and generating timely intelligence. The problem is that translation is hard. Human translation is slow, expensive, and scarce. Machine translation is inaccurate and biased. We propose using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLM) to generate translations that can accurately capture the nuances of cybercrime language. We apply our technique to public chats from the NoName057(16) Russian-speaking hacktivist group. Our results show that our fine-tuned LLM model is better, faster, more accurate, and able to capture nuances of the language. Our method shows it is possible to achieve high-fidelity translations and significantly reduce costs by a factor ranging from 430 to 23,000 compared to a human translator.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01940v1,2024-04
SGSH: Stimulate Large Language Models with Skeleton Heuristics for Knowledge Base Question Generation,"Shasha Guo, Lizi Liao, Jing Zhang, Yanling Wang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen","Knowledge base question generation (KBQG) aims to generate natural language questions from a set of triplet facts extracted from KB. Existing methods have significantly boosted the performance of KBQG via pre-trained language models (PLMs) thanks to the richly endowed semantic knowledge. With the advance of pre-training techniques, large language models (LLMs) (e.g., GPT-3.5) undoubtedly possess much more semantic knowledge. Therefore, how to effectively organize and exploit the abundant knowledge for KBQG becomes the focus of our study. In this work, we propose SGSH--a simple and effective framework to Stimulate GPT-3.5 with Skeleton Heuristics to enhance KBQG. The framework incorporates ""skeleton heuristics"", which provides more fine-grained guidance associated with each input to stimulate LLMs to generate optimal questions, encompassing essential elements like the question phrase and the auxiliary verb.More specifically, we devise an automatic data construction strategy leveraging ChatGPT to construct a skeleton training dataset, based on which we employ a soft prompting approach to train a BART model dedicated to generating the skeleton associated with each input. Subsequently, skeleton heuristics are encoded into the prompt to incentivize GPT-3.5 to generate desired questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGSH derives the new state-of-the-art performance on the KBQG tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01923v1,2024-04
A Rationale-centric Counterfactual Data Augmentation Method for Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution,"Bowen Ding, Qingkai Min, Shengkun Ma, Yingjie Li, Linyi Yang, Yue Zhang","Based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), event coreference resolution (ECR) systems have demonstrated outstanding performance in clustering coreferential events across documents. However, the existing system exhibits an excessive reliance on the `triggers lexical matching' spurious pattern in the input mention pair text. We formalize the decision-making process of the baseline ECR system using a Structural Causal Model (SCM), aiming to identify spurious and causal associations (i.e., rationales) within the ECR task. Leveraging the debiasing capability of counterfactual data augmentation, we develop a rationale-centric counterfactual data augmentation method with LLM-in-the-loop. This method is specialized for pairwise input in the ECR system, where we conduct direct interventions on triggers and context to mitigate the spurious association while emphasizing the causation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular cross-document ECR benchmarks and demonstrates robustness in out-of-domain scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01921v2,2024-04
SCANNER: Knowledge-Enhanced Approach for Robust Multi-modal Named Entity Recognition of Unseen Entities,"Hyunjong Ok, Taeho Kil, Sukmin Seo, Jaeho Lee","Recent advances in named entity recognition (NER) have pushed the boundary of the task to incorporate visual signals, leading to many variants, including multi-modal NER (MNER) or grounded MNER (GMNER). A key challenge to these tasks is that the model should be able to generalize to the entities unseen during the training, and should be able to handle the training samples with noisy annotations. To address this obstacle, we propose SCANNER (Span CANdidate detection and recognition for NER), a model capable of effectively handling all three NER variants. SCANNER is a two-stage structure; we extract entity candidates in the first stage and use it as a query to get knowledge, effectively pulling knowledge from various sources. We can boost our performance by utilizing this entity-centric extracted knowledge to address unseen entities. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges arising from noisy annotations in NER datasets, we introduce a novel self-distillation method, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of our model in processing training data with inherent uncertainties. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on the NER benchmark and surpasses existing methods on both MNER and GMNER benchmarks. Further analysis shows that the proposed distillation and knowledge utilization methods improve the performance of our model on various benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01914v1,2024-04
Humanizing Machine-Generated Content: Evading AI-Text Detection through Adversarial Attack,"Ying Zhou, Ben He, Le Sun","With the development of large language models (LLMs), detecting whether text is generated by a machine becomes increasingly challenging in the face of malicious use cases like the spread of false information, protection of intellectual property, and prevention of academic plagiarism. While well-trained text detectors have demonstrated promising performance on unseen test data, recent research suggests that these detectors have vulnerabilities when dealing with adversarial attacks such as paraphrasing. In this paper, we propose a framework for a broader class of adversarial attacks, designed to perform minor perturbations in machine-generated content to evade detection. We consider two attack settings: white-box and black-box, and employ adversarial learning in dynamic scenarios to assess the potential enhancement of the current detection model's robustness against such attacks. The empirical results reveal that the current detection models can be compromised in as little as 10 seconds, leading to the misclassification of machine-generated text as human-written content. Furthermore, we explore the prospect of improving the model's robustness over iterative adversarial learning. Although some improvements in model robustness are observed, practical applications still face significant challenges. These findings shed light on the future development of AI-text detectors, emphasizing the need for more accurate and robust detection methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01907v1,2024-04
When Abel Kills Cain: What Machine Translation Cannot Capture,"Aurélien Bénel, Joris Falip, Philippe Lacour","The article aims at identifying what, from a structural point of view, AI based automatic translators cannot fully capture. It focuses on the machine's mistakes, in order to try to explain its causes. The biblical story of Ca\""in and Abel has been chosen because of its rich interpretive and critical tradition, but also because of its semantic difficulty. The investigation begins with the observation, for the translation of this text, of the language pairs and interfaces offered by the best known machine translation services (Google Translate, DeepL). A typology of the most frequent translation errors is then established. Finally, contemporary translations are compared, in order to underline the unique contribution of each. In conclusion, the article suggests a revision of translation theory and, corArtificial Intelligence, Translation, Limitations, Interpretation, Comparison, Unicityelatively, a reformulation of its technology concerning cultural texts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04279v1,2024-04
Understanding How CodeLLMs (Mis)Predict Types with Activation Steering,"Francesca Lucchetti, Arjun Guha","CodeLLMs are transforming software development as we know it. This is especially true for tasks where rule-based approaches fall short, like type prediction. The type prediction task consists in adding a new type annotation to a partially typed program, such that the resulting program is closer to being fully typed. The intractability of rule-based approaches and high cost of manual annotation make CodeLLMs an attractive solution to the problem. However, CodeLLMs are still far from being deployed on the large-scale due to doubts surrounding their reliability.   To shed some light on how CodeLLMs approach type prediction, we investigate what happens when a model mispredicts a type. We show that by applying semantics-preserving edits to code, CodeLLMs are eventually misled into mispredicting type annotations. However, by leveraging activation steering we are able to ""steer"" the model back to the correct prediction, making models more robust against semantically irrelevant prompt features. We show that steering achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning directly on the type prediction task. Furthermore, we find that steering vectors computed from Python code are effective at correcting TypeScript mispredictions, and vice versa. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of its kind to suggest that CodeLLMs learn task representations that transfer across languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01903v2,2024-04
Beyond Accuracy: Evaluating the Reasoning Behavior of Large Language Models -- A Survey,"Philipp Mondorf, Barbara Plank","Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive performance on tasks involving reasoning, leading to a lively debate on whether these models possess reasoning capabilities similar to humans. However, despite these successes, the depth of LLMs' reasoning abilities remains uncertain. This uncertainty partly stems from the predominant focus on task performance, measured through shallow accuracy metrics, rather than a thorough investigation of the models' reasoning behavior. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of studies that go beyond task accuracy, offering deeper insights into the models' reasoning processes. Furthermore, we survey prevalent methodologies to evaluate the reasoning behavior of LLMs, emphasizing current trends and efforts towards more nuanced reasoning analyses. Our review suggests that LLMs tend to rely on surface-level patterns and correlations in their training data, rather than on sophisticated reasoning abilities. Additionally, we identify the need for further research that delineates the key differences between human and LLM-based reasoning. Through this survey, we aim to shed light on the complex reasoning processes within LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01869v2,2024-04
Self-StrAE at SemEval-2024 Task 1: Making Self-Structuring AutoEncoders Learn More With Less,"Mattia Opper, N. Siddharth","This paper presents two simple improvements to the Self-Structuring AutoEncoder (Self-StrAE). Firstly, we show that including reconstruction to the vocabulary as an auxiliary objective improves representation quality. Secondly, we demonstrate that increasing the number of independent channels leads to significant improvements in embedding quality, while simultaneously reducing the number of parameters. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that this trend can be followed to the extreme, even to point of reducing the total number of non-embedding parameters to seven. Our system can be pre-trained from scratch with as little as 10M tokens of input data, and proves effective across English, Spanish and Afrikaans.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01860v1,2024-04

Poro 34B and the Blessing of Multilinguality,"Risto Luukkonen, Jonathan Burdge, Elaine Zosa, Aarne Talman, Ville Komulainen, Väinö Hatanpää, Peter Sarlin, Sampo Pyysalo","The pretraining of state-of-the-art large language models now requires trillions of words of text, which is orders of magnitude more than available for the vast majority of languages. While including text in more than one language is an obvious way to acquire more pretraining data, multilinguality is often seen as a curse, and most model training efforts continue to focus near-exclusively on individual large languages. We believe that multilinguality can be a blessing and that it should be possible to substantially improve over the capabilities of monolingual models for small languages through multilingual training. In this study, we introduce Poro 34B, a 34 billion parameter model trained for 1 trillion tokens of Finnish, English, and programming languages, and demonstrate that a multilingual training approach can produce a model that not only substantially advances over the capabilities of existing models for Finnish, but also excels in translation and is competitive in its class in generating English and programming languages. We release the model parameters, scripts, and data under open licenses at https://huggingface.co/LumiOpen/Poro-34B.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01856v2,2024-04
IndoCulture: Exploring Geographically-Influenced Cultural Commonsense Reasoning Across Eleven Indonesian Provinces,"Fajri Koto, Rahmad Mahendra, Nurul Aisyah, Timothy Baldwin","Although commonsense reasoning is greatly shaped by cultural and geographical factors, previous studies have predominantly centered on cultures grounded in the English language, potentially resulting in an Anglocentric bias. In this paper, we introduce IndoCulture, aimed at understanding the influence of geographical factors on language model reasoning ability, with a specific emphasis on the diverse cultures found within eleven Indonesian provinces. In contrast to prior work that has relied on templates (Yin et al., 2022) and online scrapping (Fung et al., 2024), we create IndoCulture by asking local people to manually develop a cultural context and plausible options, across a set of predefined topics. Evaluation of 27 language models reveals several insights: (1) the open-weight Llama-3 is competitive with GPT-4, while other open-weight models struggle, with accuracies below 50%; (2) there is a general pattern of models generally performing better for some provinces, such as Bali and West Java, and less well for others; and (3) the inclusion of location context enhances performance, especially for larger models like GPT-4, emphasizing the significance of geographical context in commonsense reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01854v2,2024-04
A (More) Realistic Evaluation Setup for Generalisation of Community Models on Malicious Content Detection,"Ivo Verhoeven, Pushkar Mishra, Rahel Beloch, Helen Yannakoudakis, Ekaterina Shutova","Community models for malicious content detection, which take into account the context from a social graph alongside the content itself, have shown remarkable performance on benchmark datasets. Yet, misinformation and hate speech continue to propagate on social media networks. This mismatch can be partially attributed to the limitations of current evaluation setups that neglect the rapid evolution of online content and the underlying social graph. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation setup for model generalisation based on our few-shot subgraph sampling approach. This setup tests for generalisation through few labelled examples in local explorations of a larger graph, emulating more realistic application settings. We show this to be a challenging inductive setup, wherein strong performance on the training graph is not indicative of performance on unseen tasks, domains, or graph structures. Lastly, we show that graph meta-learners trained with our proposed few-shot subgraph sampling outperform standard community models in the inductive setup. We make our code publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01822v1,2024-04
Sentiment Analysis of Citations in Scientific Articles Using ChatGPT: Identifying Potential Biases and Conflicts of Interest,Walid Hariri,"Scientific articles play a crucial role in advancing knowledge and informing research directions. One key aspect of evaluating scientific articles is the analysis of citations, which provides insights into the impact and reception of the cited works. This article introduces the innovative use of large language models, particularly ChatGPT, for comprehensive sentiment analysis of citations within scientific articles. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, ChatGPT can discern the nuanced positivity or negativity of citations, offering insights into the reception and impact of cited works. Furthermore, ChatGPT's capabilities extend to detecting potential biases and conflicts of interest in citations, enhancing the objectivity and reliability of scientific literature evaluation.

PATCH! Psychometrics-AssisTed benCHmarking of Large Language Models: A Case Study of Proficiency in 8th Grade Mathematics,"Qixiang Fang, Daniel L. Oberski, Dong Nguyen","Many existing benchmarks of large (multimodal) language models (LLMs) focus on measuring LLMs' academic proficiency, often with also an interest in comparing model performance with human test takers. While these benchmarks have proven key to the development of LLMs, they suffer from several limitations, including questionable measurement quality (e.g., Do they measure what they are supposed to in a reliable way?), lack of quality assessment on the item level (e.g., Are some items more important or difficult than others?) and unclear human population reference (e.g., To whom can the model be compared?). In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging knowledge from psychometrics - a field dedicated to the measurement of latent variables like academic proficiency - into LLM benchmarking. We make three primary contributions. First, we introduce PATCH: a novel framework for {P}sychometrics-{A}ssis{T}ed ben{CH}marking of LLMs. PATCH addresses the aforementioned limitations, presenting a new direction for LLM benchmark research. Second, we implement PATCH by measuring GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro-Vision's proficiency in 8th grade mathematics against 56 human populations. We show that adopting a psychometrics-based approach yields evaluation outcomes that diverge from those based on existing benchmarking practices. Third, we release 4 high-quality datasets to support measuring and comparing LLM proficiency in grade school mathematics and science against human populations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01799v2,2024-04
Using Large Language Models to Understand Telecom Standards,"Athanasios Karapantelakis, Mukesh Thakur, Alexandros Nikou, Farnaz Moradi, Christian Orlog, Fitsum Gaim, Henrik Holm, Doumitrou Daniil Nimara, Vincent Huang","The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has successfully introduced standards for global mobility. However, the volume and complexity of these standards has increased over time, thus complicating access to relevant information for vendors and service providers. Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), may provide faster access to relevant information. In this paper, we evaluate the capability of state-of-art LLMs to be used as Question Answering (QA) assistants for 3GPP document reference. Our contribution is threefold. First, we provide a benchmark and measuring methods for evaluating performance of LLMs. Second, we do data preprocessing and fine-tuning for one of these LLMs and provide guidelines to increase accuracy of the responses that apply to all LLMs. Third, we provide a model of our own, TeleRoBERTa, that performs on-par with foundation LLMs but with an order of magnitude less number of parameters. Results show that LLMs can be used as a credible reference tool on telecom technical documents, and thus have potential for a number of different applications from troubleshooting and maintenance, to network operations and software product development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02929v2,2024-04

Can Humans Identify Domains?,"Maria Barrett, Max Müller-Eberstein, Elisa Bassignana, Amalie Brogaard Pauli, Mike Zhang, Rob van der Goot","Textual domain is a crucial property within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community due to its effects on downstream model performance. The concept itself is, however, loosely defined and, in practice, refers to any non-typological property, such as genre, topic, medium or style of a document. We investigate the core notion of domains via human proficiency in identifying related intrinsic textual properties, specifically the concepts of genre (communicative purpose) and topic (subject matter). We publish our annotations in *TGeGUM*: A collection of 9.1k sentences from the GUM dataset (Zeldes, 2017) with single sentence and larger context (i.e., prose) annotations for one of 11 genres (source type), and its topic/subtopic as per the Dewey Decimal library classification system (Dewey, 1979), consisting of 10/100 hierarchical topics of increased granularity. Each instance is annotated by three annotators, for a total of 32.7k annotations, allowing us to examine the level of human disagreement and the relative difficulty of each annotation task. With a Fleiss' kappa of at most 0.53 on the sentence level and 0.66 at the prose level, it is evident that despite the ubiquity of domains in NLP, there is little human consensus on how to define them. By training classifiers to perform the same task, we find that this uncertainty also extends to NLP models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01785v1,2024-04
"Stereotype Detection in LLMs: A Multiclass, Explainable, and Benchmark-Driven Approach","Zekun Wu, Sahan Bulathwela, Maria Perez-Ortiz, Adriano Soares Koshiyama","Stereotype detection is a challenging and subjective task, as certain statements, such as ""Black people like to play basketball,"" may not appear overtly toxic but still reinforce racial stereotypes. With the increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) in human-facing artificial intelligence (AI) applications, detecting these types of biases is essential. However, LLMs risk perpetuating and amplifying stereotypical outputs derived from their training data. A reliable stereotype detector is crucial for benchmarking bias, monitoring model input and output, filtering training data, and ensuring fairer model behavior in downstream applications. This paper introduces the Multi-Grain Stereotype (MGS) dataset, consisting of 51,867 instances across gender, race, profession, religion, and other stereotypes, curated from multiple existing datasets. We evaluate various machine learning approaches to establish baselines and fine-tune language models of different architectures and sizes, presenting a suite of stereotype multiclass classifiers trained on the MGS dataset. Given the subjectivity of stereotypes, explainability is essential to align model learning with human understanding of stereotypes. We employ explainable AI (XAI) tools, including SHAP, LIME, and BertViz, to assess whether the model's learned patterns align with human intuitions about stereotypes.Additionally, we develop stereotype elicitation prompts and benchmark the presence of stereotypes in text generation tasks using popular LLMs, employing the best-performing stereotype classifiers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01768v2,2024-04
Class-Incremental Few-Shot Event Detection,"Kailin Zhao, Xiaolong Jin, Long Bai, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng","Event detection is one of the fundamental tasks in information extraction and knowledge graph. However, a realistic event detection system often needs to deal with new event classes constantly. These new classes usually have only a few labeled instances as it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate a large number of unlabeled instances. Therefore, this paper proposes a new task, called class-incremental few-shot event detection. Nevertheless, this task faces two problems, i.e., old knowledge forgetting and new class overfitting. To solve these problems, this paper further presents a novel knowledge distillation and prompt learning based method, called Prompt-KD. Specifically, to handle the forgetting problem about old knowledge, Prompt-KD develops an attention based multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework, where the ancestor teacher model pre-trained on base classes is reused in all learning sessions, and the father teacher model derives the current student model via adaptation. On the other hand, in order to cope with the few-shot learning scenario and alleviate the corresponding new class overfitting problem, Prompt-KD is also equipped with a prompt learning mechanism. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., FewEvent and MAVEN, demonstrate the superior performance of Prompt-KD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01767v1,2024-04
M2SA: Multimodal and Multilingual Model for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets,"Gaurish Thakkar, Sherzod Hakimov, Marko Tadić","In recent years, multimodal natural language processing, aimed at learning from diverse data types, has garnered significant attention. However, there needs to be more clarity when it comes to analysing multimodal tasks in multi-lingual contexts. While prior studies on sentiment analysis of tweets have predominantly focused on the English language, this paper addresses this gap by transforming an existing textual Twitter sentiment dataset into a multimodal format through a straightforward curation process. Our work opens up new avenues for sentiment-related research within the research community. Additionally, we conduct baseline experiments utilising this augmented dataset and report the findings. Notably, our evaluations reveal that when comparing unimodal and multimodal configurations, using a sentiment-tuned large language model as a text encoder performs exceptionally well.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01753v3,2024-04
Octopus v2: On-device language model for super agent,"Wei Chen, Zhiyuan Li","Language models have shown effectiveness in a variety of software applications, particularly in tasks related to automatic workflow. These models possess the crucial ability to call functions, which is essential in creating AI agents. Despite the high performance of large-scale language models in cloud environments, they are often associated with concerns over privacy and cost. Current on-device models for function calling face issues with latency and accuracy. Our research presents a new method that empowers an on-device model with 2 billion parameters to surpass the performance of GPT-4 in both accuracy and latency, and decrease the context length by 95\%. When compared to Llama-7B with a RAG-based function calling mechanism, our method enhances latency by 35-fold. This method reduces the latency to levels deemed suitable for deployment across a variety of edge devices in production environments, aligning with the performance requisites for real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01744v5,2024-04
Transfer Learning from Whisper for Microscopic Intelligibility Prediction,"Paul Best, Santiago Cuervo, Ricard Marxer","Macroscopic intelligibility models predict the expected human word-error-rate for a given speech-in-noise stimulus. In contrast, microscopic intelligibility models aim to make fine-grained predictions about listeners' perception, e.g. predicting phonetic or lexical responses. State-of-the-art macroscopic models use transfer learning from large scale deep learning models for speech processing, whereas such methods have rarely been used for microscopic modeling. In this paper, we study the use of transfer learning from Whisper, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for automatic speech recognition, for microscopic intelligibility prediction at the level of lexical responses. Our method outperforms the considered baselines, even in a zero-shot setup, and yields a relative improvement of up to 66\% when fine-tuned to predict listeners' responses. Our results showcase the promise of large scale deep learning based methods for microscopic intelligibility prediction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01737v1,2024-04
Sentence-level Media Bias Analysis with Event Relation Graph,"Yuanyuan Lei, Ruihong Huang","Media outlets are becoming more partisan and polarized nowadays. In this paper, we identify media bias at the sentence level, and pinpoint bias sentences that intend to sway readers' opinions. As bias sentences are often expressed in a neutral and factual way, considering broader context outside a sentence can help reveal the bias. In particular, we observe that events in a bias sentence need to be understood in associations with other events in the document. Therefore, we propose to construct an event relation graph to explicitly reason about event-event relations for sentence-level bias identification. The designed event relation graph consists of events as nodes and four common types of event relations: coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent relations. Then, we incorporate event relation graph for bias sentences identification in two steps: an event-aware language model is built to inject the events and event relations knowledge into the basic language model via soft labels; further, a relation-aware graph attention network is designed to update sentence embedding with events and event relations information based on hard labels. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach with the aid of event relation graph improves both precision and recall of bias sentence identification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01722v1,2024-04
Self-Improvement Programming for Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering,"Zhuo Chen, Zhao Zhang, Zixuan Li, Fei Wang, Yutao Zeng, Xiaolong Jin, Yongjun Xu","Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer questions with temporal intent over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). The core challenge of this task lies in understanding the complex semantic information regarding multiple types of time constraints (e.g., before, first) in questions. Existing end-to-end methods implicitly model the time constraints by learning time-aware embeddings of questions and candidate answers, which is far from understanding the question comprehensively. Motivated by semantic-parsing-based approaches that explicitly model constraints in questions by generating logical forms with symbolic operators, we design fundamental temporal operators for time constraints and introduce a novel self-improvement Programming method for TKGQA (Prog-TQA). Specifically, Prog-TQA leverages the in-context learning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the combinatory time constraints in the questions and generate corresponding program drafts with a few examples given. Then, it aligns these drafts to TKGs with the linking module and subsequently executes them to generate the answers. To enhance the ability to understand questions, Prog-TQA is further equipped with a self-improvement strategy to effectively bootstrap LLMs using high-quality self-generated drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Prog-TQA on MultiTQ and CronQuestions datasets, especially in the Hits@1 metric.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01720v1,2024-04
Effective internal language model training and fusion for factorized transducer model,"Jinxi Guo, Niko Moritz, Yingyi Ma, Frank Seide, Chunyang Wu, Jay Mahadeokar, Ozlem Kalinli, Christian Fuegen, Mike Seltzer","The internal language model (ILM) of the neural transducer has been widely studied. In most prior work, it is mainly used for estimating the ILM score and is subsequently subtracted during inference to facilitate improved integration with external language models. Recently, various of factorized transducer models have been proposed, which explicitly embrace a standalone internal language model for non-blank token prediction. However, even with the adoption of factorized transducer models, limited improvement has been observed compared to shallow fusion. In this paper, we propose a novel ILM training and decoding strategy for factorized transducer models, which effectively combines the blank, acoustic and ILM scores. Our experiments show a 17% relative improvement over the standard decoding method when utilizing a well-trained ILM and the proposed decoding strategy on LibriSpeech datasets. Furthermore, when compared to a strong RNN-T baseline enhanced with external LM fusion, the proposed model yields a 5.5% relative improvement on general-sets and an 8.9% WER reduction for rare words. The proposed model can achieve superior performance without relying on external language models, rendering it highly efficient for production use-cases. To further improve the performance, we propose a novel and memory-efficient ILM-fusion-aware minimum word error rate (MWER) training method which improves ILM integration significantly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01716v1,2024-04
EMONA: Event-level Moral Opinions in News Articles,"Yuanyuan Lei, Md Messal Monem Miah, Ayesha Qamar, Sai Ramana Reddy, Jonathan Tong, Haotian Xu, Ruihong Huang","Most previous research on moral frames has focused on social media short texts, little work has explored moral sentiment within news articles. In news articles, authors often express their opinions or political stance through moral judgment towards events, specifically whether the event is right or wrong according to social moral rules. This paper initiates a new task to understand moral opinions towards events in news articles. We have created a new dataset, EMONA, and annotated event-level moral opinions in news articles. This dataset consists of 400 news articles containing over 10k sentences and 45k events, among which 9,613 events received moral foundation labels. Extracting event morality is a challenging task, as moral judgment towards events can be very implicit. Baseline models were built for event moral identification and classification. In addition, we also conduct extrinsic evaluations to integrate event-level moral opinions into three downstream tasks. The statistical analysis and experiments show that moral opinions of events can serve as informative features for identifying ideological bias or subjective events.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01715v1,2024-04
Generative AI for Immersive Communication: The Next Frontier in Internet-of-Senses Through 6G,"Nassim Sehad, Lina Bariah, Wassim Hamidouche, Hamed Hellaoui, Riku Jäntti, Mérouane Debbah","Over the past two decades, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has become a transformative concept, and as we approach 2030, a new paradigm known as the Internet of Senses (IoS) is emerging. Unlike conventional Virtual Reality (VR), IoS seeks to provide multi-sensory experiences, acknowledging that in our physical reality, our perception extends far beyond just sight and sound; it encompasses a range of senses. This article explores the existing technologies driving immersive multi-sensory media, delving into their capabilities and potential applications. This exploration includes a comparative analysis between conventional immersive media streaming and a proposed use case that leverages semantic communication empowered by generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). The focal point of this analysis is the substantial reduction in bandwidth consumption by 99.93% in the proposed scheme. Through this comparison, we aim to underscore the practical applications of generative AI for immersive media. Concurrently addressing major challenges in this field, such as temporal synchronization of multiple media, ensuring high throughput, minimizing the End-to-End (E2E) latency, and robustness to low bandwidth while outlining future trajectories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01713v2,2024-04
Polarity Calibration for Opinion Summarization,"Yuanyuan Lei, Kaiqiang Song, Sangwoo Cho, Xiaoyang Wang, Ruihong Huang, Dong Yu","Opinion summarization is automatically generating summaries from a variety of subjective information, such as product reviews or political opinions. The challenge of opinions summarization lies in presenting divergent or even conflicting opinions. We conduct an analysis of previous summarization models, which reveals their inclination to amplify the polarity bias, emphasizing the majority opinions while ignoring the minority opinions. To address this issue and make the summarizer express both sides of opinions, we introduce the concept of polarity calibration, which aims to align the polarity of output summary with that of input text. Specifically, we develop a reinforcement training approach for polarity calibration. This approach feeds the polarity distance between output summary and input text as reward into the summarizer, and also balance polarity calibration with content preservation and language naturality. We evaluate our Polarity Calibration model (PoCa) on two types of opinions summarization tasks: summarizing product reviews and political opinions articles. Automatic and human evaluation demonstrate that our approach can mitigate the polarity mismatch between output summary and input text, as well as maintain the content semantic and language quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01706v1,2024-04
On the Role of Summary Content Units in Text Summarization Evaluation,"Marcel Nawrath, Agnieszka Nowak, Tristan Ratz, Danilo C. Walenta, Juri Opitz, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, João Sedoc, Daniel Deutsch, Simon Mille, Yixin Liu, Lining Zhang, Sebastian Gehrmann, Saad Mahamood, Miruna Clinciu, Khyathi Chandu, Yufang Hou","At the heart of the Pyramid evaluation method for text summarization lie human written summary content units (SCUs). These SCUs are concise sentences that decompose a summary into small facts. Such SCUs can be used to judge the quality of a candidate summary, possibly partially automated via natural language inference (NLI) systems. Interestingly, with the aim to fully automate the Pyramid evaluation, Zhang and Bansal (2021) show that SCUs can be approximated by automatically generated semantic role triplets (STUs). However, several questions currently lack answers, in particular: i) Are there other ways of approximating SCUs that can offer advantages? ii) Under which conditions are SCUs (or their approximations) offering the most value? In this work, we examine two novel strategies to approximate SCUs: generating SCU approximations from AMR meaning representations (SMUs) and from large language models (SGUs), respectively. We find that while STUs and SMUs are competitive, the best approximation quality is achieved by SGUs. We also show through a simple sentence-decomposition baseline (SSUs) that SCUs (and their approximations) offer the most value when ranking short summaries, but may not help as much when ranking systems or longer summaries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01701v1,2024-04
Event Detection from Social Media for Epidemic Prediction,"Tanmay Parekh, Anh Mac, Jiarui Yu, Yuxuan Dong, Syed Shahriar, Bonnie Liu, Eric Yang, Kuan-Hao Huang, Wei Wang, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang","Social media is an easy-to-access platform providing timely updates about societal trends and events. Discussions regarding epidemic-related events such as infections, symptoms, and social interactions can be crucial for informing policymaking during epidemic outbreaks. In our work, we pioneer exploiting Event Detection (ED) for better preparedness and early warnings of any upcoming epidemic by developing a framework to extract and analyze epidemic-related events from social media posts. To this end, we curate an epidemic event ontology comprising seven disease-agnostic event types and construct a Twitter dataset SPEED with human-annotated events focused on the COVID-19 pandemic. Experimentation reveals how ED models trained on COVID-based SPEED can effectively detect epidemic events for three unseen epidemics of Monkeypox, Zika, and Dengue; while models trained on existing ED datasets fail miserably. Furthermore, we show that reporting sharp increases in the extracted events by our framework can provide warnings 4-9 weeks earlier than the WHO epidemic declaration for Monkeypox. This utility of our framework lays the foundations for better preparedness against emerging epidemics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01679v2,2024-04
Towards Generalizable and Faithful Logic Reasoning over Natural Language via Resolution Refutation,"Zhouhao Sun, Xiao Ding, Li Du, Bibo Cai, Jinglong Gao, Ting Liu, Qin Bing","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance in various natural language reasoning tasks. However, they still struggle with performing first-order logic reasoning over formal logical theories expressed in natural language. This is because the previous LLMs-based reasoning systems have the theoretical incompleteness issue. As a result, it can only address a limited set of simple reasoning problems, which significantly decreases their generalization ability. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, named Generalizable and Faithful Reasoner (GFaiR), which introduces the paradigm of resolution refutation. Resolution refutation has the capability to solve all first-order logic reasoning problems by extending reasoning rules and employing the principle of proof by contradiction, so our system's completeness can be improved by introducing resolution refutation. Experimental results demonstrate that our system outperforms previous works by achieving state-of-the-art performances in complex scenarios while maintaining performances in simple scenarios. Besides, we observe that GFaiR is faithful to its reasoning process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01677v2,2024-04
METAL: Towards Multilingual Meta-Evaluation,"Rishav Hada, Varun Gumma, Mohamed Ahmed, Kalika Bali, Sunayana Sitaram","With the rising human-like precision of Large Language Models (LLMs) in numerous tasks, their utilization in a variety of real-world applications is becoming more prevalent. Several studies have shown that LLMs excel on many standard NLP benchmarks. However, it is challenging to evaluate LLMs due to test dataset contamination and the limitations of traditional metrics. Since human evaluations are difficult to collect, there is a growing interest in the community to use LLMs themselves as reference-free evaluators for subjective metrics. However, past work has shown that LLM-based evaluators can exhibit bias and have poor alignment with human judgments. In this study, we propose a framework for an end-to-end assessment of LLMs as evaluators in multilingual scenarios. We create a carefully curated dataset, covering 10 languages containing native speaker judgments for the task of summarization. This dataset is created specifically to evaluate LLM-based evaluators, which we refer to as meta-evaluation (METAL). We compare the performance of LLM-based evaluators created using GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and PaLM2. Our results indicate that LLM-based evaluators based on GPT-4 perform the best across languages, while GPT-3.5-Turbo performs poorly. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the reasoning provided by LLM-based evaluators and find that it often does not match the reasoning provided by human judges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01667v1,2024-04
CMAT: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Tuning Framework for Enhancing Small Language Models,"Xuechen Liang, Meiling Tao, Yinghui Xia, Tianyu Shi, Jun Wang, JingSong Yang","Open large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, showcasing impressive performance across various tasks.Despite the significant advancements in LLMs, their effective operation still relies heavily on human input to accurately guide the dialogue flow, with agent tuning being a crucial optimization technique that involves human adjustments to the model for better response to such guidance.Addressing this dependency, our work introduces the TinyAgent model, trained on a meticulously curated high-quality dataset. We also present the Collaborative Multi-Agent Tuning (CMAT) framework, an innovative system designed to augment language agent capabilities through adaptive weight updates based on environmental feedback. This framework fosters collaborative learning and real-time adaptation among multiple intelligent agents, enhancing their context-awareness and long-term memory. In this research, we propose a new communication agent framework that integrates multi-agent systems with environmental feedback mechanisms, offering a scalable method to explore cooperative behaviors. Notably, our TinyAgent-7B model exhibits performance on par with GPT-3.5, despite having fewer parameters, signifying a substantial improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01663v4,2024-04
Release of Pre-Trained Models for the Japanese Language,"Kei Sawada, Tianyu Zhao, Makoto Shing, Kentaro Mitsui, Akio Kaga, Yukiya Hono, Toshiaki Wakatsuki, Koh Mitsuda","AI democratization aims to create a world in which the average person can utilize AI techniques. To achieve this goal, numerous research institutes have attempted to make their results accessible to the public. In particular, large pre-trained models trained on large-scale data have shown unprecedented potential, and their release has had a significant impact. However, most of the released models specialize in the English language, and thus, AI democratization in non-English-speaking communities is lagging significantly. To reduce this gap in AI access, we released Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), Contrastive Language and Image Pre-training (CLIP), Stable Diffusion, and Hidden-unit Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (HuBERT) pre-trained in Japanese. By providing these models, users can freely interface with AI that aligns with Japanese cultural values and ensures the identity of Japanese culture, thus enhancing the democratization of AI. Additionally, experiments showed that pre-trained models specialized for Japanese can efficiently achieve high performance in Japanese tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01657v1,2024-04
Towards Better Generalization in Open-Domain Question Answering by Mitigating Context Memorization,"Zixuan Zhang, Revanth Gangi Reddy, Kevin Small, Tong Zhang, Heng Ji","Open-domain Question Answering (OpenQA) aims at answering factual questions with an external large-scale knowledge corpus. However, real-world knowledge is not static; it updates and evolves continually. Such a dynamic characteristic of knowledge poses a vital challenge for these models, as the trained models need to constantly adapt to the latest information to make sure that the answers remain accurate. In addition, it is still unclear how well an OpenQA model can transfer to completely new knowledge domains. In this paper, we investigate the generalization performance of a retrieval-augmented QA model in two specific scenarios: 1) adapting to updated versions of the same knowledge corpus; 2) switching to completely different knowledge domains. We observe that the generalization challenges of OpenQA models stem from the reader's over-reliance on memorizing the knowledge from the external corpus, which hinders the model from generalizing to a new knowledge corpus. We introduce Corpus-Invariant Tuning (CIT), a simple but effective training strategy, to mitigate the knowledge over-memorization by controlling the likelihood of retrieved contexts during training. Extensive experimental results on multiple OpenQA benchmarks show that CIT achieves significantly better generalizability without compromising the model's performance in its original corpus and domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01652v1,2024-04
"NLP Systems That Can't Tell Use from Mention Censor Counterspeech, but Teaching the Distinction Helps","Kristina Gligoric, Myra Cheng, Lucia Zheng, Esin Durmus, Dan Jurafsky","The use of words to convey speaker's intent is traditionally distinguished from the `mention' of words for quoting what someone said, or pointing out properties of a word. Here we show that computationally modeling this use-mention distinction is crucial for dealing with counterspeech online. Counterspeech that refutes problematic content often mentions harmful language but is not harmful itself (e.g., calling a vaccine dangerous is not the same as expressing disapproval of someone for calling vaccines dangerous). We show that even recent language models fail at distinguishing use from mention, and that this failure propagates to two key downstream tasks: misinformation and hate speech detection, resulting in censorship of counterspeech. We introduce prompting mitigations that teach the use-mention distinction, and show they reduce these errors. Our work highlights the importance of the use-mention distinction for NLP and CSS and offers ways to address it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01651v1,2024-04

Entity Disambiguation via Fusion Entity Decoding,"Junxiong Wang, Ali Mousavi, Omar Attia, Ronak Pradeep, Saloni Potdar, Alexander M. Rush, Umar Farooq Minhas, Yunyao Li","Entity disambiguation (ED), which links the mentions of ambiguous entities to their referent entities in a knowledge base, serves as a core component in entity linking (EL). Existing generative approaches demonstrate improved accuracy compared to classification approaches under the standardized ZELDA benchmark. Nevertheless, generative approaches suffer from the need for large-scale pre-training and inefficient generation. Most importantly, entity descriptions, which could contain crucial information to distinguish similar entities from each other, are often overlooked. We propose an encoder-decoder model to disambiguate entities with more detailed entity descriptions. Given text and candidate entities, the encoder learns interactions between the text and each candidate entity, producing representations for each entity candidate. The decoder then fuses the representations of entity candidates together and selects the correct entity. Our experiments, conducted on various entity disambiguation benchmarks, demonstrate the strong and robust performance of this model, particularly +1.5% in the ZELDA benchmark compared with GENRE. Furthermore, we integrate this approach into the retrieval/reader framework and observe +1.5% improvements in end-to-end entity linking in the GERBIL benchmark compared with EntQA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01626v2,2024-04
Transforming LLMs into Cross-modal and Cross-lingual Retrieval Systems,"Frank Palma Gomez, Ramon Sanabria, Yun-hsuan Sung, Daniel Cer, Siddharth Dalmia, Gustavo Hernandez Abrego","Large language models (LLMs) are trained on text-only data that go far beyond the languages with paired speech and text data. At the same time, Dual Encoder (DE) based retrieval systems project queries and documents into the same embedding space and have demonstrated their success in retrieval and bi-text mining. To match speech and text in many languages, we propose using LLMs to initialize multi-modal DE retrieval systems. Unlike traditional methods, our system doesn't require speech data during LLM pre-training and can exploit LLM's multilingual text understanding capabilities to match speech and text in languages unseen during retrieval training. Our multi-modal LLM-based retrieval system is capable of matching speech and text in 102 languages despite only training on 21 languages. Our system outperforms previous systems trained explicitly on all 102 languages. We achieve a 10% absolute improvement in Recall@1 averaged across these languages. Additionally, our model demonstrates cross-lingual speech and text matching, which is further enhanced by readily available machine translation data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01616v3,2024-04
Helmsman of the Masses? Evaluate the Opinion Leadership of Large Language Models in the Werewolf Game,"Silin Du, Xiaowei Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited memorable strategic behaviors in social deductive games. However, the significance of opinion leadership exhibited by LLM-based agents has been largely overlooked, which is crucial for practical applications in multi-agent and human-AI interaction settings. Opinion leaders are individuals who have a noticeable impact on the beliefs and behaviors of others within a social group. In this work, we employ the Werewolf game as a simulation platform to assess the opinion leadership of LLMs. The game includes the role of the Sheriff, tasked with summarizing arguments and recommending decision options, and therefore serves as a credible proxy for an opinion leader. We develop a framework integrating the Sheriff role and devise two novel metrics based on the critical characteristics of opinion leaders. The first metric measures the reliability of the opinion leader, and the second assesses the influence of the opinion leader on other players' decisions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate LLMs of different scales. In addition, we collect a Werewolf question-answering dataset (WWQA) to assess and enhance LLM's grasp of the game rules, and we also incorporate human participants for further analysis. The results suggest that the Werewolf game is a suitable test bed to evaluate the opinion leadership of LLMs, and few LLMs possess the capacity for opinion leadership.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01602v2,2024-04
Classifying Cancer Stage with Open-Source Clinical Large Language Models,"Chia-Hsuan Chang, Mary M. Lucas, Grace Lu-Yao, Christopher C. Yang","Cancer stage classification is important for making treatment and care management plans for oncology patients. Information on staging is often included in unstructured form in clinical, pathology, radiology and other free-text reports in the electronic health record system, requiring extensive work to parse and obtain. To facilitate the extraction of this information, previous NLP approaches rely on labeled training datasets, which are labor-intensive to prepare. In this study, we demonstrate that without any labeled training data, open-source clinical large language models (LLMs) can extract pathologic tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) staging information from real-world pathology reports. Our experiments compare LLMs and a BERT-based model fine-tuned using the labeled data. Our findings suggest that while LLMs still exhibit subpar performance in Tumor (T) classification, with the appropriate adoption of prompting strategies, they can achieve comparable performance on Metastasis (M) classification and improved performance on Node (N) classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01589v1,2024-04
Hallucination Diversity-Aware Active Learning for Text Summarization,"Yu Xia, Xu Liu, Tong Yu, Sungchul Kim, Ryan A. Rossi, Anup Rao, Tung Mai, Shuai Li","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown propensity to generate hallucinated outputs, i.e., texts that are factually incorrect or unsupported. Existing methods for alleviating hallucinations typically require costly human annotations to identify and correct hallucinations in LLM outputs. Moreover, most of these methods focus on a specific type of hallucination, e.g., entity or token errors, which limits their effectiveness in addressing various types of hallucinations exhibited in LLM outputs. To our best knowledge, in this paper we propose the first active learning framework to alleviate LLM hallucinations, reducing costly human annotations of hallucination needed. By measuring fine-grained hallucinations from errors in semantic frame, discourse and content verifiability in text summarization, we propose HAllucination Diversity-Aware Sampling (HADAS) to select diverse hallucinations for annotations in active learning for LLM finetuning. Extensive experiments on three datasets and different backbone models demonstrate advantages of our method in effectively and efficiently mitigating LLM hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01588v1,2024-04
Evaluating Large Language Models Using Contrast Sets: An Experimental Approach,Manish Sanwal,"In the domain of Natural Language Inference (NLI), especially in tasks involving the classification of multiple input texts, the Cross-Entropy Loss metric is widely employed as a standard for error measurement. However, this metric falls short in effectively evaluating a model's capacity to understand language entailments. In this study, we introduce an innovative technique for generating a contrast set for the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. Our strategy involves the automated substitution of verbs, adverbs, and adjectives with their synonyms to preserve the original meaning of sentences. This method aims to assess whether a model's performance is based on genuine language comprehension or simply on pattern recognition. We conducted our analysis using the ELECTRA-small model. The model achieved an accuracy of 89.9% on the conventional SNLI dataset but showed a reduced accuracy of 72.5% on our contrast set, indicating a substantial 17% decline. This outcome led us to conduct a detailed examination of the model's learning behaviors. Following this, we improved the model's resilience by fine-tuning it with a contrast-enhanced training dataset specifically designed for SNLI, which increased its accuracy to 85.5% on the contrast sets. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating diverse linguistic expressions into datasets for NLI tasks. We hope that our research will encourage the creation of more inclusive datasets, thereby contributing to the development of NLI models that are both more sophisticated and effective.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01569v2,2024-04

This study introduces a new strategy aimed at harnessing on-device LLMs in invoking software APIs. We meticulously compile a dataset derived from software API documentation and apply fine-tuning to LLMs with capacities of 2B, 3B and 7B parameters, specifically to enhance their proficiency in software API interactions. Our approach concentrates on refining the models' grasp of API structures and syntax, significantly enhancing the accuracy of API function calls. Additionally, we propose \textit{conditional masking} techniques to ensure outputs in the desired formats and reduce error rates while maintaining inference speeds. We also propose a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in API interactions, establishing a foundation for subsequent research. Octopus, the fine-tuned model, is proved to have better performance than GPT-4 for the software APIs calling. This research aims to advance automated software development and API integration, representing substantial progress in aligning LLM capabilities with the demands of practical software engineering applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01549v1,2024-04
Laying Anchors: Semantically Priming Numerals in Language Modeling,"Mandar Sharma, Rutuja Murlidhar Taware, Pravesh Koirala, Nikhil Muralidhar, Naren Ramakrishnan","Off-the-shelf pre-trained language models have become the de facto standard in NLP pipelines for a multitude of downstream tasks. However, the inability of these models to properly encode numerals limits their performance on tasks requiring numeric comprehension. We introduce strategies to semantically prime numerals in any corpus by generating anchors governed by the distribution of numerals in said corpus, thereby enabling mathematically grounded representations of these numeral tokens. We establish the superiority of our proposed techniques through evaluation on a range of numeracy tasks for both in-domain (seen) and out-domain (unseen) numerals. Further, we expand our empirical evaluations to numerals ranging from 1 to 10 billion, a significantly broader range compared to previous studies of the same nature, and we demonstrate significant improvements in the mathematical grounding of our learned embeddings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01536v2,2024-04
Set-Aligning Framework for Auto-Regressive Event Temporal Graph Generation,"Xingwei Tan, Yuxiang Zhou, Gabriele Pergola, Yulan He","Event temporal graphs have been shown as convenient and effective representations of complex temporal relations between events in text. Recent studies, which employ pre-trained language models to auto-regressively generate linearised graphs for constructing event temporal graphs, have shown promising results. However, these methods have often led to suboptimal graph generation as the linearised graphs exhibit set characteristics which are instead treated sequentially by language models. This discrepancy stems from the conventional text generation objectives, leading to erroneous penalisation of correct predictions caused by the misalignment of elements in target sequences. To address these challenges, we reframe the task as a conditional set generation problem, proposing a Set-aligning Framework tailored for the effective utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework incorporates data augmentations and set-property regularisations designed to alleviate text generation loss penalties associated with the linearised graph edge sequences, thus encouraging the generation of more relation edges. Experimental results show that our framework surpasses existing baselines for event temporal graph generation. Furthermore, under zero-shot settings, the structural knowledge introduced through our framework notably improves model generalisation, particularly when the training examples available are limited.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01532v1,2024-04
AAdaM at SemEval-2024 Task 1: Augmentation and Adaptation for Multilingual Semantic Textual Relatedness,"Miaoran Zhang, Mingyang Wang, Jesujoba O. Alabi, Dietrich Klakow","This paper presents our system developed for the SemEval-2024 Task 1: Semantic Textual Relatedness for African and Asian Languages. The shared task aims at measuring the semantic textual relatedness between pairs of sentences, with a focus on a range of under-represented languages. In this work, we propose using machine translation for data augmentation to address the low-resource challenge of limited training data. Moreover, we apply task-adaptive pre-training on unlabeled task data to bridge the gap between pre-training and task adaptation. For model training, we investigate both full fine-tuning and adapter-based tuning, and adopt the adapter framework for effective zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. We achieve competitive results in the shared task: our system performs the best among all ranked teams in both subtask A (supervised learning) and subtask C (cross-lingual transfer).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01490v2,2024-04
A Study on Scaling Up Multilingual News Framing Analysis,"Syeda Sabrina Akter, Antonios Anastasopoulos","Media framing is the study of strategically selecting and presenting specific aspects of political issues to shape public opinion. Despite its relevance to almost all societies around the world, research has been limited due to the lack of available datasets and other resources. This study explores the possibility of dataset creation through crowdsourcing, utilizing non-expert annotators to develop training corpora. We first extend framing analysis beyond English news to a multilingual context (12 typologically diverse languages) through automatic translation. We also present a novel benchmark in Bengali and Portuguese on the immigration and same-sex marriage domains. Additionally, we show that a system trained on our crowd-sourced dataset, combined with other existing ones, leads to a 5.32 percentage point increase from the baseline, showing that crowdsourcing is a viable option. Last, we study the performance of large language models (LLMs) for this task, finding that task-specific fine-tuning is a better approach than employing bigger non-specialized models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01481v1,2024-04
TraveLER: A Modular Multi-LMM Agent Framework for Video Question-Answering,"Chuyi Shang, Amos You, Sanjay Subramanian, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig","Recently, image-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in video question-answering (VideoQA) using a frame-wise approach by leveraging large-scale pretraining in a zero-shot manner. Nevertheless, these models need to be capable of finding relevant information, extracting it, and answering the question simultaneously. Currently, existing methods perform all of these steps in a single pass without being able to adapt if insufficient or incorrect information is collected. To overcome this, we introduce a modular multi-LMM agent framework based on several agents with different roles, instructed by a Planner agent that updates its instructions using shared feedback from the other agents. Specifically, we propose TraveLER, a method that can create a plan to ""Traverse"" through the video, ask questions about individual frames to ""Locate"" and store key information, and then ""Evaluate"" if there is enough information to answer the question. Finally, if there is not enough information, our method is able to ""Replan"" based on its collected knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed TraveLER approach improves performance on several VideoQA benchmarks without the need to fine-tune on specific datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/traveler-framework/TraveLER.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01476v2,2024-04
Finding Replicable Human Evaluations via Stable Ranking Probability,"Parker Riley, Daniel Deutsch, George Foster, Viresh Ratnakar, Ali Dabirmoghaddam, Markus Freitag","Reliable human evaluation is critical to the development of successful natural language generation models, but achieving it is notoriously difficult. Stability is a crucial requirement when ranking systems by quality: consistent ranking of systems across repeated evaluations is not just desirable, but essential. Without it, there is no reliable foundation for hill-climbing or product launch decisions. In this paper, we use machine translation and its state-of-the-art human evaluation framework, MQM, as a case study to understand how to set up reliable human evaluations that yield stable conclusions. We investigate the optimal configurations for item allocation to raters, number of ratings per item, and score normalization. Our study on two language pairs provides concrete recommendations for designing replicable human evaluation studies. We also collect and release the largest publicly available dataset of multi-segment translations rated by multiple professional translators, consisting of nearly 140,000 segment annotations across two language pairs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01474v1,2024-04
OpenChemIE: An Information Extraction Toolkit For Chemistry Literature,"Vincent Fan, Yujie Qian, Alex Wang, Amber Wang, Connor W. Coley, Regina Barzilay","Information extraction from chemistry literature is vital for constructing up-to-date reaction databases for data-driven chemistry. Complete extraction requires combining information across text, tables, and figures, whereas prior work has mainly investigated extracting reactions from single modalities. In this paper, we present OpenChemIE to address this complex challenge and enable the extraction of reaction data at the document level. OpenChemIE approaches the problem in two steps: extracting relevant information from individual modalities and then integrating the results to obtain a final list of reactions. For the first step, we employ specialized neural models that each address a specific task for chemistry information extraction, such as parsing molecules or reactions from text or figures. We then integrate the information from these modules using chemistry-informed algorithms, allowing for the extraction of fine-grained reaction data from reaction condition and substrate scope investigations. Our machine learning models attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated individually, and we meticulously annotate a challenging dataset of reaction schemes with R-groups to evaluate our pipeline as a whole, achieving an F1 score of 69.5%. Additionally, the reaction extraction results of \ours attain an accuracy score of 64.3% when directly compared against the Reaxys chemical database.

Will the Real Linda Please Stand up...to Large Language Models? Examining the Representativeness Heuristic in LLMs,"Pengda Wang, Zilin Xiao, Hanjie Chen, Frederick L. Oswald","Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in modeling text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so. Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic. This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example, versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence. This research investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning. We created ReHeAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics. Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to ReHeAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases. We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than on the problem's description. Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model to use its knowledge. This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases. It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while falling into a cognitive trap. This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01461v4,2024-04
Unveiling Divergent Inductive Biases of LLMs on Temporal Data,"Sindhu Kishore, Hangfeng He","Unraveling the intricate details of events in natural language necessitates a subtle understanding of temporal dynamics. Despite the adeptness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in discerning patterns and relationships from data, their inherent comprehension of temporal dynamics remains a formidable challenge. This research meticulously explores these intrinsic challenges within LLMs, with a specific emphasis on evaluating the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models in the analysis of temporal data. Employing two distinct prompt types, namely Question Answering (QA) format and Textual Entailment (TE) format, our analysis probes into both implicit and explicit events. The findings underscore noteworthy trends, revealing disparities in the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Notably, biases toward specific temporal relationships come to light, with GPT-3.5 demonstrating a preference for ""AFTER'' in the QA format for both implicit and explicit events, while GPT-4 leans towards ""BEFORE''. Furthermore, a consistent pattern surfaces wherein GPT-3.5 tends towards ""TRUE'', and GPT-4 exhibits a preference for ""FALSE'' in the TE format for both implicit and explicit events. This persistent discrepancy between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in handling temporal data highlights the intricate nature of inductive bias in LLMs, suggesting that the evolution of these models may not merely mitigate bias but may introduce new layers of complexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01453v1,2024-04
Enterprise Use Cases Combining Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing,"Phillip Schneider, Tim Schopf, Juraj Vladika, Florian Matthes","Knowledge management is a critical challenge for enterprises in today's digital world, as the volume and complexity of data being generated and collected continue to grow incessantly. Knowledge graphs (KG) emerged as a promising solution to this problem by providing a flexible, scalable, and semantically rich way to organize and make sense of data. This paper builds upon a recent survey of the research literature on combining KGs and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Based on selected application scenarios from enterprise context, we discuss synergies that result from such a combination. We cover various approaches from the three core areas of KG construction, reasoning as well as KG-based NLP tasks. In addition to explaining innovative enterprise use cases, we assess their maturity in terms of practical applicability and conclude with an outlook on emergent application areas for the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01443v1,2024-04
Creating emoji lexica from unsupervised sentiment analysis of their descriptions,"Milagros Fernández-Gavilanes, Jonathan Juncal-Martínez, Silvia García-Méndez, Enrique Costa-Montenegro, Francisco Javier González-Castaño","Online media, such as blogs and social networking sites, generate massive volumes of unstructured data of great interest to analyze the opinions and sentiments of individuals and organizations. Novel approaches beyond Natural Language Processing are necessary to quantify these opinions with polarity metrics. So far, the sentiment expressed by emojis has received little attention. The use of symbols, however, has boomed in the past four years. About twenty billion are typed in Twitter nowadays, and new emojis keep appearing in each new Unicode version, making them increasingly relevant to sentiment analysis tasks. This has motivated us to propose a novel approach to predict the sentiments expressed by emojis in online textual messages, such as tweets, that does not require human effort to manually annotate data and saves valuable time for other analysis tasks. For this purpose, we automatically constructed a novel emoji sentiment lexicon using an unsupervised sentiment analysis system based on the definitions given by emoji creators in Emojipedia. Additionally, we automatically created lexicon variants by also considering the sentiment distribution of the informal texts accompanying emojis. All these lexica are evaluated and compared regarding the improvement obtained by including them in sentiment analysis of the annotated datasets provided by Kralj Novak et al. (2015). The results confirm the competitiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01439v1,2024-04
Position-Aware Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning Approach for Reducing Positional Bias in LLMs,"Zheng Zhang, Fan Yang, Ziyan Jiang, Zheng Chen, Zhengyang Zhao, Chengyuan Ma, Liang Zhao, Yang Liu","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced their ability to process long input contexts. This development is particularly crucial for tasks that involve retrieving knowledge from an external datastore, which can result in long inputs. However, recent studies show a positional bias in LLMs, demonstrating varying performance depending on the location of useful information within the input sequence. In this study, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the root causes of positional bias. Our findings indicate that the primary contributor to LLM positional bias stems from the inherent positional preferences of different models. We demonstrate that merely employing prompt-based solutions is inadequate for overcoming the positional preferences. To address this positional bias issue of a pre-trained LLM, we developed a Position-Aware Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PAPEFT) approach which is composed of a data augmentation technique and a parameter efficient adapter, enhancing a uniform attention distribution across the input context. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces positional bias, improving LLMs' effectiveness in handling long context sequences for various tasks that require externally retrieved knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01430v1,2024-04
Is Model Collapse Inevitable? Breaking the Curse of Recursion by Accumulating Real and Synthetic Data,"Matthias Gerstgrasser, Rylan Schaeffer, Apratim Dey, Rafael Rafailov, Henry Sleight, John Hughes, Tomasz Korbak, Rajashree Agrawal, Dhruv Pai, Andrey Gromov, Daniel A. Roberts, Diyi Yang, David L. Donoho, Sanmi Koyejo","The proliferation of generative models, combined with pretraining on web-scale data, raises a timely question: what happens when these models are trained on their own generated outputs? Recent investigations into model-data feedback loops proposed that such loops would lead to a phenomenon termed model collapse, under which performance progressively degrades with each model-data feedback iteration until fitted models become useless. However, those studies largely assumed that new data replace old data over time, where an arguably more realistic assumption is that data accumulate over time. In this paper, we ask: what effect does accumulating data have on model collapse? We empirically study this question by pretraining sequences of language models on text corpora. We confirm that replacing the original real data by each generation's synthetic data does indeed tend towards model collapse, then demonstrate that accumulating the successive generations of synthetic data alongside the original real data avoids model collapse; these results hold across a range of model sizes, architectures, and hyperparameters. We obtain similar results for deep generative models on other types of real data: diffusion models for molecule conformation generation and variational autoencoders for image generation. To understand why accumulating data can avoid model collapse, we use an analytically tractable framework introduced by prior work in which a sequence of linear models are fit to the previous models' outputs. Previous work used this framework to show that if data are replaced, the test error increases with the number of model-fitting iterations; we extend this argument to prove that if data instead accumulate, the test error has a finite upper bound independent of the number of iterations, meaning model collapse no longer occurs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01413v2,2024-04
Developing Safe and Responsible Large Language Model : Can We Balance Bias Reduction and Language Understanding in Large Language Models?,"Shaina Raza, Oluwanifemi Bamgbose, Shardul Ghuge, Fatemeh Tavakol, Deepak John Reji, Syed Raza Bashir","Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation and translation, among others. However, these models often generate texts that can perpetuate biases. Existing approaches to mitigate these biases usually compromise knowledge retention. This study explores whether LLMs can produce safe, unbiased outputs without sacrificing knowledge or comprehension. We introduce the Safe and Responsible Large Language Model (\textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$), which has been instruction fine-tuned atop of a safe fine-tuned auto-regressive decoder-only LLM to reduce biases in generated texts. We developed a specialized dataset with examples of unsafe and corresponding safe variations to train \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ to identify and correct biased text. Experiments on our specialized dataset and out-of-distribution test sets reveal that \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ effectively reduces biases while preserving knowledge integrity. This performance surpasses that of traditional fine-tuning of smaller language models and base LLMs that merely reply on prompting techniques. Our findings demonstrate that instruction fine-tuning on custom datasets tailored for tasks such as debiasing is a highly effective strategy for minimizing bias in LLM while preserving their inherent knowledge and capabilities.

CausalChaos! Dataset for Comprehensive Causal Action Question Answering Over Longer Causal Chains Grounded in Dynamic Visual Scenes,"Paritosh Parmar, Eric Peh, Ruirui Chen, Ting En Lam, Yuhan Chen, Elston Tan, Basura Fernando","Causal video question answering (QA) has garnered increasing interest, yet existing datasets often lack depth in causal reasoning. To address this gap, we capitalize on the unique properties of cartoons and construct CausalChaos!, a novel, challenging causal Why-QA dataset built upon the iconic ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoon series. Cartoons use the principles of animation that allow animators to create expressive, unambiguous causal relationships between events to form a coherent storyline. Utilizing these properties, along with thought-provoking questions and multi-level answers (answer and detailed causal explanation), our questions involve causal chains that interconnect multiple dynamic interactions between characters and visual scenes. These factors demand models to solve more challenging, yet well-defined causal relationships. We also introduce hard incorrect answer mining, including a causally confusing version that is even more challenging. While models perform well, there is much room for improvement, especially, on open-ended answers. We identify more advanced/explicit causal relationship modeling & joint modeling of vision and language as the immediate areas for future efforts to focus upon. Along with the other complementary datasets, our new challenging dataset will pave the way for these developments in the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01299v2,2024-04
Towards Safety and Helpfulness Balanced Responses via Controllable Large Language Models,"Yi-Lin Tuan, Xilun Chen, Eric Michael Smith, Louis Martin, Soumya Batra, Asli Celikyilmaz, William Yang Wang, Daniel M. Bikel","As large language models (LLMs) become easily accessible nowadays, the trade-off between safety and helpfulness can significantly impact user experience. A model that prioritizes safety will cause users to feel less engaged and assisted while prioritizing helpfulness will potentially cause harm. Possible harms include teaching people how to build a bomb, exposing youth to inappropriate content, and hurting users' mental health. In this work, we propose to balance safety and helpfulness in diverse use cases by controlling both attributes in LLM. We explore training-free and fine-tuning methods that do not require extra human annotations and analyze the challenges of controlling safety and helpfulness in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can rewind a learned model and unlock its controllability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01295v1,2024-04
Evaluating Text-to-Visual Generation with Image-to-Text Generation,"Zhiqiu Lin, Deepak Pathak, Baiqi Li, Jiayao Li, Xide Xia, Graham Neubig, Pengchuan Zhang, Deva Ramanan","Despite significant progress in generative AI, comprehensive evaluation remains challenging because of the lack of effective metrics and standardized benchmarks. For instance, the widely-used CLIPScore measures the alignment between a (generated) image and text prompt, but it fails to produce reliable scores for complex prompts involving compositions of objects, attributes, and relations. One reason is that text encoders of CLIP can notoriously act as a ""bag of words"", conflating prompts such as ""the horse is eating the grass"" with ""the grass is eating the horse"". To address this, we introduce the VQAScore, which uses a visual-question-answering (VQA) model to produce an alignment score by computing the probability of a ""Yes"" answer to a simple ""Does this figure show '{text}'?"" question. Though simpler than prior art, VQAScore computed with off-the-shelf models produces state-of-the-art results across many (8) image-text alignment benchmarks. We also compute VQAScore with an in-house model that follows best practices in the literature. For example, we use a bidirectional image-question encoder that allows image embeddings to depend on the question being asked (and vice versa). Our in-house model, CLIP-FlanT5, outperforms even the strongest baselines that make use of the proprietary GPT-4V. Interestingly, although we train with only images, VQAScore can also align text with video and 3D models. VQAScore allows researchers to benchmark text-to-visual generation using complex texts that capture the compositional structure of real-world prompts. We introduce GenAI-Bench, a more challenging benchmark with 1,600 compositional text prompts that require parsing scenes, objects, attributes, relationships, and high-order reasoning like comparison and logic. GenAI-Bench also offers over 15,000 human ratings for leading image and video generation models such as Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, and Gen2.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01291v2,2024-04
"Large Language Models are Capable of Offering Cognitive Reappraisal, if Guided","Hongli Zhan, Allen Zheng, Yoon Kyung Lee, Jina Suh, Junyi Jessy Li, Desmond C. Ong","Large language models (LLMs) have offered new opportunities for emotional support, and recent work has shown that they can produce empathic responses to people in distress. However, long-term mental well-being requires emotional self-regulation, where a one-time empathic response falls short. This work takes a first step by engaging with cognitive reappraisals, a strategy from psychology practitioners that uses language to targetedly change negative appraisals that an individual makes of the situation; such appraisals is known to sit at the root of human emotional experience. We hypothesize that psychologically grounded principles could enable such advanced psychology capabilities in LLMs, and design RESORT which consists of a series of reappraisal constitutions across multiple dimensions that can be used as LLM instructions. We conduct a first-of-its-kind expert evaluation (by clinical psychologists with M.S. or Ph.D. degrees) of an LLM's zero-shot ability to generate cognitive reappraisal responses to medium-length social media messages asking for support. This fine-grained evaluation showed that even LLMs at the 7B scale guided by RESORT are capable of generating empathic responses that can help users reappraise their situations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01288v2,2024-04
Prompt-prompted Adaptive Structured Pruning for Efficient LLM Generation,"Harry Dong, Beidi Chen, Yuejie Chi","With the development of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), they have been applied to many fields due to their remarkable utility, but this comes at a considerable computational cost at deployment. Fortunately, some methods such as pruning or constructing a mixture of experts (MoE) aim at exploiting sparsity in transformer feedforward (FF) blocks to gain boosts in speed and reduction in memory requirements. However, these techniques can be very costly and inflexible in practice, as they often require training or are restricted to specific types of architectures. To address this, we introduce GRIFFIN, a novel training-free and calibration-free method that selects unique FF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of LLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a critical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured FF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking. Despite our method's simplicity, we show with 50% of the FF parameters, GRIFFIN maintains the original model's performance with little to no degradation on a variety of classification and generation tasks, all while improving latency (e.g. 1.29$\times$ and 1.25$\times$ speed-ups in Gemma 7B and Llama 2 13B, respectively, on an NVIDIA L40).

TWIN-GPT: Digital Twins for Clinical Trials via Large Language Model,"Yue Wang, Tianfan Fu, Yinlong Xu, Zihan Ma, Hongxia Xu, Yingzhou Lu, Bang Du, Honghao Gao, Jian Wu","Clinical trials are indispensable for medical research and the development of new treatments. However, clinical trials often involve thousands of participants and can span several years to complete, with a high probability of failure during the process. Recently, there has been a burgeoning interest in virtual clinical trials, which simulate real-world scenarios and hold the potential to significantly enhance patient safety, expedite development, reduce costs, and contribute to the broader scientific knowledge in healthcare. Existing research often focuses on leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) to support clinical trial outcome prediction. Yet, trained with limited clinical trial outcome data, existing approaches frequently struggle to perform accurate predictions. Some research has attempted to generate EHRs to augment model development but has fallen short in personalizing the generation for individual patient profiles. Recently, the emergence of large language models has illuminated new possibilities, as their embedded comprehensive clinical knowledge has proven beneficial in addressing medical issues. In this paper, we propose a large language model-based digital twin creation approach, called TWIN-GPT. TWIN-GPT can establish cross-dataset associations of medical information given limited data, generating unique personalized digital twins for different patients, thereby preserving individual patient characteristics. Comprehensive experiments show that using digital twins created by TWIN-GPT can boost the clinical trial outcome prediction, exceeding various previous prediction approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01273v2,2024-04

Recently, there has been immense speculation about how many people are using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in their academic writing, and to what extent this tool might have an effect on global scientific practices. However, we lack a precise measure of the proportion of academic writing substantially modified or produced by LLMs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale analysis across 950,965 papers published between January 2020 and February 2024 on the arXiv, bioRxiv, and Nature portfolio journals, using a population-level statistical framework to measure the prevalence of LLM-modified content over time. Our statistical estimation operates on the corpus level and is more robust than inference on individual instances. Our findings reveal a steady increase in LLM usage, with the largest and fastest growth observed in Computer Science papers (up to 17.5%). In comparison, Mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed the least LLM modification (up to 6.3%). Moreover, at an aggregate level, our analysis reveals that higher levels of LLM-modification are associated with papers whose first authors post preprints more frequently, papers in more crowded research areas, and papers of shorter lengths. Our findings suggests that LLMs are being broadly used in scientific writings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01268v1,2024-04
IsoBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Foundation Models on Isomorphic Representations,"Deqing Fu, Ruohao Guo, Ghazal Khalighinejad, Ollie Liu, Bhuwan Dhingra, Dani Yogatama, Robin Jia, Willie Neiswanger","Current foundation models exhibit impressive capabilities when prompted either with text only or with both image and text inputs.

Each example is presented with multiple $\textbf{isomorphic representations}$ of inputs, such as visual, textual, and mathematical presentations. IsoBench provides fine-grained feedback to diagnose performance gaps caused by the form of the representation. Across various foundation models, we observe that on the same problem, models have a consistent preference towards textual representations. Most prominently, when evaluated on all IsoBench problems, Claude-3 Opus performs 28.7 points worse when provided with images instead of text; similarly, GPT-4 Turbo is 18.7 points worse and Gemini Pro is 14.9 points worse.

FABLES: Evaluating faithfulness and content selection in book-length summarization,"Yekyung Kim, Yapei Chang, Marzena Karpinska, Aparna Garimella, Varun Manjunatha, Kyle Lo, Tanya Goyal, Mohit Iyyer","While long-context large language models (LLMs) can technically summarize book-length documents (>100K tokens), the length and complexity of the documents have so far prohibited evaluations of input-dependent aspects like faithfulness. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale human evaluation of faithfulness and content selection on LLM-generated summaries of fictional books. Our study mitigates the issue of data contamination by focusing on summaries of books published in 2023 or 2024, and we hire annotators who have fully read each book prior to the annotation task to minimize cost and cognitive burden. We collect FABLES, a dataset of annotations on 3,158 claims made in LLM-generated summaries of 26 books, at a cost of $5.2K USD, which allows us to rank LLM summarizers based on faithfulness: Claude-3-Opus significantly outperforms all closed-source LLMs, while the open-source Mixtral is on par with GPT-3.5-Turbo. An analysis of the annotations reveals that most unfaithful claims relate to events and character states, and they generally require indirect reasoning over the narrative to invalidate. While LLM-based auto-raters have proven reliable for factuality and coherence in other settings, we implement several LLM raters of faithfulness and find that none correlates strongly with human annotations, especially with regard to detecting unfaithful claims. Our experiments suggest that detecting unfaithful claims is an important future direction not only for summarization evaluation but also as a testbed for long-context understanding. Finally, we move beyond faithfulness by exploring content selection errors in book-length summarization: we develop a typology of omission errors related to crucial narrative elements and also identify a systematic over-emphasis on events occurring towards the end of the book.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01261v2,2024-04
UniArk: Improving Generalisation and Consistency for Factual Knowledge Extraction through Debiasing,"Yijun Yang, Jie He, Pinzhen Chen, Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto, Jeff Z. Pan","Several recent papers have investigated the potential of language models as knowledge bases as well as the existence of severe biases when extracting factual knowledge. In this work, we focus on the factual probing performance over unseen prompts from tuning, and using a probabilistic view we show the inherent misalignment between pre-training and downstream tuning objectives in language models for probing knowledge. We hypothesize that simultaneously debiasing these objectives can be the key to generalisation over unseen prompts. We propose an adapter-based framework, UniArk, for generalised and consistent factual knowledge extraction through simple methods without introducing extra parameters. Extensive experiments show that UniArk can significantly improve the model's out-of-domain generalisation as well as consistency under various prompts. Additionally, we construct ParaTrex, a large-scale and diverse dataset for measuring the inconsistency and out-of-domain generation of models. Further, ParaTrex offers a reference method for constructing paraphrased datasets using large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01253v1,2024-04
"An image speaks a thousand words, but can everyone listen? On image transcreation for cultural relevance","Simran Khanuja, Sathyanarayanan Ramamoorthy, Yueqi Song, Graham Neubig","Given the rise of multimedia content, human translators increasingly focus on culturally adapting not only words but also other modalities such as images to convey the same meaning. While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to dealing with language in speech and text. In this work, we take a first step towards translating images to make them culturally relevant. First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task. Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset: i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image, and ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications. We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers in the loop. Best pipelines can only translate 5% of images for some countries in the easier concept dataset and no translation is successful for some countries in the application dataset, highlighting the challenging nature of the task. Our code and data is released here: https://github.com/simran-khanuja/image-transcreation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01247v3,2024-04
"A Statistical Framework of Watermarks for Large Language Models: Pivot, Detection Efficiency and Optimal Rules","Xiang Li, Feng Ruan, Huiyuan Wang, Qi Long, Weijie J. Su","Since ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, embedding (nearly) unnoticeable statistical signals into text generated by large language models (LLMs), also known as watermarking, has been used as a principled approach to provable detection of LLM-generated text from its human-written counterpart. In this paper, we introduce a general and flexible framework for reasoning about the statistical efficiency of watermarks and designing powerful detection rules. Inspired by the hypothesis testing formulation of watermark detection, our framework starts by selecting a pivotal statistic of the text and a secret key -- provided by the LLM to the verifier -- to enable controlling the false positive rate (the error of mistakenly detecting human-written text as LLM-generated). Next, this framework allows one to evaluate the power of watermark detection rules by obtaining a closed-form expression of the asymptotic false negative rate (the error of incorrectly classifying LLM-generated text as human-written). Our framework further reduces the problem of determining the optimal detection rule to solving a minimax optimization program. We apply this framework to two representative watermarks -- one of which has been internally implemented at OpenAI -- and obtain several findings that can be instrumental in guiding the practice of implementing watermarks. In particular, we derive optimal detection rules for these watermarks under our framework. These theoretically derived detection rules are demonstrated to be competitive and sometimes enjoy a higher power than existing detection approaches through numerical experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01245v3,2024-04
Effectively Prompting Small-sized Language Models for Cross-lingual Tasks via Winning Tickets,"Mingqi Li, Feng Luo","Current soft prompt methods yield limited performance when applied to small-sized models (fewer than a billion parameters). Deep prompt-tuning, which entails prepending parameters in each layer for enhanced efficacy, presents a solution for prompting small-sized models, albeit requiring carefully designed implementation. In this paper, we introduce the Lottery Ticket Prompt-learning (LTP) framework that integrates winning tickets with soft prompts. The LTP offers a simpler implementation and requires only a one-time execution. We demonstrate LTP on cross-lingual tasks, where prior works rely on external tools like human-designed multilingual templates and bilingual dictionaries, which may not be feasible in a low-resource regime. Specifically, we select a subset of parameters that have been changed the most during the fine-tuning with the Masked Language Modeling objective. Then, we prepend soft prompts to the original pre-trained language model and only update the selected parameters together with prompt-related parameters when adapting to the downstream tasks. We verify the effectiveness of our LTP framework on cross-lingual tasks, specifically targeting low-resource languages. Our approach outperforms the baselines by only updating 20\% of the original parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01242v1,2024-04
AURORA: Navigating UI Tarpits via Automated Neural Screen Understanding,"Safwat Ali Khan, Wenyu Wang, Yiran Ren, Bin Zhu, Jiangfan Shi, Alyssa McGowan, Wing Lam, Kevin Moran","Nearly a decade of research in software engineering has focused on automating mobile app testing to help engineers in overcoming the unique challenges associated with the software platform. Much of this work has come in the form of Automated Input Generation tools (AIG tools) that dynamically explore app screens. However, such tools have repeatedly been demonstrated to achieve lower-than-expected code coverage - particularly on sophisticated proprietary apps. Prior work has illustrated that a primary cause of these coverage deficiencies is related to so-called tarpits, or complex screens that are difficult to navigate.   In this paper, we take a critical step toward enabling AIG tools to effectively navigate tarpits during app exploration through a new form of automated semantic screen understanding. We introduce AURORA, a technique that learns from the visual and textual patterns that exist in mobile app UIs to automatically detect common screen designs and navigate them accordingly. The key idea of AURORA is that there are a finite number of mobile app screen designs, albeit with subtle variations, such that the general patterns of different categories of UI designs can be learned. As such, AURORA employs a multi-modal, neural screen classifier that is able to recognize the most common types of UI screen designs. After recognizing a given screen, it then applies a set of flexible and generalizable heuristics to properly navigate the screen. We evaluated AURORA both on a set of 12 apps with known tarpits from prior work, and on a new set of five of the most popular apps from the Google Play store. Our results indicate that AURORA is able to effectively navigate tarpit screens, outperforming prior approaches that avoid tarpits by 19.6% in terms of method coverage. The improvements can be attributed to AURORA's UI design classification and heuristic navigation techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01240v1,2024-04

Open-Vocabulary Federated Learning with Multimodal Prototyping,"Huimin Zeng, Zhenrui Yue, Dong Wang","Existing federated learning (FL) studies usually assume the training label space and test label space are identical. However, in real-world applications, this assumption is too ideal to be true. A new user could come up with queries that involve data from unseen classes, and such open-vocabulary queries would directly defect such FL systems. Therefore, in this work, we explicitly focus on the under-explored open-vocabulary challenge in FL. That is, for a new user, the global server shall understand her/his query that involves arbitrary unknown classes. To address this problem, we leverage the pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). In particular, we present a novel adaptation framework tailored for VLMs in the context of FL, named as Federated Multimodal Prototyping (Fed-MP). Fed-MP adaptively aggregates the local model weights based on light-weight client residuals, and makes predictions based on a novel multimodal prototyping mechanism. Fed-MP exploits the knowledge learned from the seen classes, and robustifies the adapted VLM to unseen categories. Our empirical evaluation on various datasets validates the effectiveness of Fed-MP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01232v2,2024-04

The Fine Line: Navigating Large Language Model Pretraining with Down-streaming Capability Analysis,"Chen Yang, Junzhuo Li, Xinyao Niu, Xinrun Du, Songyang Gao, Haoran Zhang, Zhaoliang Chen, Xingwei Qu, Ruibin Yuan, Yizhi Li, Jiaheng Liu, Stephen W. Huang, Shawn Yue, Ge Zhang","Uncovering early-stage metrics that reflect final model performance is one core principle for large-scale pretraining. The existing scaling law demonstrates the power-law correlation between pretraining loss and training flops, which serves as an important indicator of the current training state for large language models. However, this principle only focuses on the model's compression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with the ability improvements on the downstream tasks. Some follow-up works attempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as hyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic differences among various capabilities during pretraining. To address the aforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of model capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints. Through this analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar training dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion parameters. In addition to our core findings, we've reproduced Amber and OpenLLaMA, releasing their intermediate checkpoints. This initiative offers valuable resources to the research community and facilitates the verification and exploration of LLM pretraining by open-source researchers. Besides, we provide empirical summaries, including performance comparisons of different models and capabilities, and tuition of key metrics for different training phases.

Estimating Lexical Complexity from Document-Level Distributions,"Sondre Wold, Petter Mæhlum, Oddbjørn Hove","Existing methods for complexity estimation are typically developed for entire documents. This limitation in scope makes them inapplicable for shorter pieces of text, such as health assessment tools. These typically consist of lists of independent sentences, all of which are too short for existing methods to apply. The choice of wording in these assessment tools is crucial, as both the cognitive capacity and the linguistic competency of the intended patient groups could vary substantially. As a first step towards creating better tools for supporting health practitioners, we develop a two-step approach for estimating lexical complexity that does not rely on any pre-annotated data. We implement our approach for the Norwegian language and verify its effectiveness using statistical testing and a qualitative evaluation of samples from real assessment tools. We also investigate the relationship between our complexity measure and certain features typically associated with complexity in the literature, such as word length, frequency, and the number of syllables.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01196v1,2024-04
Generating Faithful and Complete Hospital-Course Summaries from the Electronic Health Record,Griffin Adams,"The rapid adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has been instrumental in streamlining administrative tasks, increasing transparency, and enabling continuity of care across providers. An unintended consequence of the increased documentation burden, however, has been reduced face-time with patients and, concomitantly, a dramatic rise in clinician burnout. In this thesis, we pinpoint a particularly time-intensive, yet critical, documentation task: generating a summary of a patient's hospital admissions, and propose and evaluate automated solutions. In Chapter 2, we construct a dataset based on 109,000 hospitalizations (2M source notes) and perform exploratory analyses to motivate future work on modeling and evaluation [NAACL 2021]. In Chapter 3, we address faithfulness from a modeling perspective by revising noisy references [EMNLP 2022] and, to reduce the reliance on references, directly calibrating model outputs to metrics [ACL 2023]. These works relied heavily on automatic metrics as human annotations were limited. To fill this gap, in Chapter 4, we conduct a fine-grained expert annotation of system errors in order to meta-evaluate existing metrics and better understand task-specific issues of domain adaptation and source-summary alignments. To learn a metric less correlated to extractiveness (copy-and-paste), we derive noisy faithfulness labels from an ensemble of existing metrics and train a faithfulness classifier on these pseudo labels [MLHC 2023]. Finally, in Chapter 5, we demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs (Mistral and Zephyr) are highly prone to entity hallucinations and cover fewer salient entities. We improve both coverage and faithfulness by performing sentence-level entity planning based on a set of pre-computed salient entities from the source text, which extends our work on entity-guided news summarization [ACL, 2023], [EMNLP, 2023].",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01189v1,2024-04

Addressing the lack of specific datasets for food-based salt content inquiries, we develop a template-based conversational dataset. The dataset is structured to ask clarification questions to identify food items and their salt content. Our findings indicate that while fine-tuning transformer-based models on the dataset yields limited performance, the integration of Neuro-Symbolic Rules significantly enhances the system's performance. Our experiments show that by integrating neuro-symbolic rules, our system achieves an improvement in joint goal accuracy of over 20% across different data sizes compared to naively fine-tuning transformer-based models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01182v1,2024-04
Exploring LLM Multi-Agents for ICD Coding,"Rumeng Li, Xun Wang, Hong Yu","To address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding task, where they often produce inaccurate and incomplete prediction results due to the high-dimensional and skewed distribution of the ICD codes, and often lack interpretability and reliability as well. We introduce an innovative multi-agent approach for ICD coding which mimics the ICD coding assignment procedure in real-world settings, comprising five distinct agents: the patient, physician, coder, reviewer, and adjuster. Each agent utilizes an LLM-based model tailored to their specific role within the coding process. We also integrate the system with Electronic Health Record (HER)'s SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) structure to boost the performances. We compare our method with a system of agents designed solely by LLMs and other strong baselines and evaluate it using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset. Our multi-agent coding framework significantly outperforms Zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and self-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC) in coding common and rare ICD codes. An ablation study validates the effectiveness of the designated agent roles. it also outperforms the LLM-designed agent system. Moreover, our method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art ICD coding methods that require extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, and outperforms them in rare code accuracy, and explainability. Additionally, we demonstrate the method's practical applicability by presenting its performance in scenarios not limited by the common or rare ICD code constraints.The proposed multi-agent method for ICD coding effectively mimics the real-world coding process and improves performance on both common and rare codes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15363v2,2024-04
LITE: Modeling Environmental Ecosystems with Multimodal Large Language Models,"Haoran Li, Junqi Liu, Zexian Wang, Shiyuan Luo, Xiaowei Jia, Huaxiu Yao","The modeling of environmental ecosystems plays a pivotal role in the sustainable management of our planet. Accurate prediction of key environmental variables over space and time can aid in informed policy and decision-making, thus improving people's livelihood. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promise in modeling the spatial-temporal relationships for predicting environmental variables. However, these approaches often fall short in handling incomplete features and distribution shifts, which are commonly observed in environmental data due to the substantial cost of data collection and malfunctions in measuring instruments. To address these issues, we propose LITE -- a multimodal large language model for environmental ecosystems modeling. Specifically, LITE unifies different environmental variables by transforming them into natural language descriptions and line graph images. Then, LITE utilizes unified encoders to capture spatial-temporal dynamics and correlations in different modalities. During this step, the incomplete features are imputed by a sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework, and the distribution shift is handled by incorporating multi-granularity information from past observations. Finally, guided by domain instructions, a language model is employed to fuse the multimodal representations for the prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly enhances performance in environmental spatial-temporal prediction across different domains compared to the best baseline, with a 41.25% reduction in prediction error. This justifies its effectiveness. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/hrlics/LITE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01165v2,2024-04

"Green AI: Exploring Carbon Footprints, Mitigation Strategies, and Trade Offs in Large Language Model Training","Vivian Liu, Yiqiao Yin","Prominent works in the field of Natural Language Processing have long attempted to create new innovative models by improving upon previous model training approaches, altering model architecture, and developing more in-depth datasets to better their performance. However, with the quickly advancing field of NLP comes increased greenhouse gas emissions, posing concerns over the environmental damage caused by training LLMs. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the various costs, particularly those pertaining to environmental aspects, that are associated with artificial intelligence serves as the foundational basis for ensuring safe AI models. Currently, investigations into the CO2 emissions of AI models remain an emerging area of research, and as such, in this paper, we evaluate the CO2 emissions of well-known large language models, which have an especially high carbon footprint due to their significant amount of model parameters. We argue for the training of LLMs in a way that is responsible and sustainable by suggesting measures for reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, we discuss how the choice of hardware affects CO2 emissions by contrasting the CO2 emissions during model training for two widely used GPUs. Based on our results, we present the benefits and drawbacks of our proposed solutions and make the argument for the possibility of training more environmentally safe AI models without sacrificing their robustness and performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01157v1,2024-04
Do LLMs Find Human Answers To Fact-Driven Questions Perplexing?

However, the study of using LLMs to model human-like answers to fact-driven social media questions is still under-explored. In this work, we investigate how LLMs model the wide variety of human answers to fact-driven questions posed on several topic-specific Reddit communities, or subreddits. We collect and release a dataset of 409 fact-driven questions and 7,534 diverse, human-rated answers from 15 r/Ask{Topic} communities across 3 categories: profession, social identity, and geographic location. We find that LLMs are considerably better at modeling highly-rated human answers to such questions, as opposed to poorly-rated human answers.

KoCoNovel: Annotated Dataset of Character Coreference in Korean Novels,"Kyuhee Kim, Surin Lee, Sangah Lee","In this paper, we present KoCoNovel, a novel character coreference dataset derived from Korean literary texts, complete with detailed annotation guidelines. Comprising 178K tokens from 50 modern and contemporary novels, KoCoNovel stands as one of the largest public coreference resolution corpora in Korean, and the first to be based on literary texts. KoCoNovel offers four distinct versions to accommodate a wide range of literary coreference analysis needs. These versions are designed to support perspectives of the omniscient author or readers, and to manage multiple entities as either separate or overlapping, thereby broadening its applicability. One of KoCoNovel's distinctive features is that 24% of all character mentions are single common nouns, lacking possessive markers or articles. This feature is particularly influenced by the nuances of Korean address term culture, which favors the use of terms denoting social relationships and kinship over personal names. In experiments with a BERT-based coreference model, we observe notable performance enhancements with KoCoNovel in character coreference tasks within literary texts, compared to a larger non-literary coreference dataset. Such findings underscore KoCoNovel's potential to significantly enhance coreference resolution models through the integration of Korean cultural and linguistic dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01140v2,2024-04
Emphasising Structured Information: Integrating Abstract Meaning Representation into LLMs for Enhanced Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation,"Bohao Yang, Kun Zhao, Chen Tang, Dong Liu, Liang Zhan, Chenghua Lin","Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention. Trainable evaluation metrics, typically trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores to responses that share greater content similarity with a given context. However, adversarial negative responses, despite possessing high content similarity with the contexts, are semantically different. Consequently, existing evaluation metrics are not robust enough to evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still face challenges in effectively handling adversarial negative examples. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for open-domain dialogue evaluation, which combines domain-specific language models (SLMs) enhanced with Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) knowledge with LLMs. The SLMs can explicitly incorporate AMR graph information of the dialogue through a gating mechanism for enhanced dialogue semantic representation learning. Both the evaluation result from the SLMs and the AMR graph information are incorporated into the LLM's prompt for enhanced evaluation performance. Experimental results on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, especially in discriminating adversarial negative responses.

SentiCSE: A Sentiment-aware Contrastive Sentence Embedding Framework with Sentiment-guided Textual Similarity,"Jaemin Kim, Yohan Na, Kangmin Kim, Sang Rak Lee, Dong-Kyu Chae","Recently, sentiment-aware pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate impressive results in downstream sentiment analysis tasks. However, they neglect to evaluate the quality of their constructed sentiment representations; they just focus on improving the fine-tuning performance, which overshadows the representation quality. We argue that without guaranteeing the representation quality, their downstream performance can be highly dependent on the supervision of the fine-tuning data rather than representation quality. This problem would make them difficult to foray into other sentiment-related domains, especially where labeled data is scarce. We first propose Sentiment-guided Textual Similarity (SgTS), a novel metric for evaluating the quality of sentiment representations, which is designed based on the degree of equivalence in sentiment polarity between two sentences. We then propose SentiCSE, a novel Sentiment-aware Contrastive Sentence Embedding framework for constructing sentiment representations via combined word-level and sentence-level objectives, whose quality is guaranteed by SgTS. Qualitative and quantitative comparison with the previous sentiment-aware PLMs shows the superiority of our work.

What is in Your Safe Data? Identifying Benign Data that Breaks Safety,"Luxi He, Mengzhou Xia, Peter Henderson","Current Large Language Models (LLMs), even those tuned for safety and alignment, are susceptible to jailbreaking. Some have found that just further fine-tuning an aligned model with benign data (i.e., data without harmful content) surprisingly leads to substantial degradation in safety. We delve into the data-centric aspects of why benign fine-tuning inadvertently contributes to jailbreaking. First, we represent fine-tuning data through two lenses: representation and gradient spaces. Additionally, we propose a bi-directional anchoring method that, during the selection process, prioritizes data points that are close to harmful examples and far from benign ones. Our approach effectively identifies subsets of benign data that are more likely to degrade the model's safety after fine-tuning. Training on just 100 of these seemingly benign datapoints surprisingly leads to the fine-tuned model affirmatively responding to >70% of tested harmful requests, compared to <20% after fine-tuning on randomly selected data. We also observe that the selected data frequently appear as lists, bullet points, or math questions, indicating a systematic pattern in fine-tuning data that contributes to jailbreaking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01099v2,2024-04

Advancing AI with Integrity: Ethical Challenges and Solutions in Neural Machine Translation,"Richard Kimera, Yun-Seon Kim, Heeyoul Choi","This paper addresses the ethical challenges of Artificial Intelligence in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems, emphasizing the imperative for developers to ensure fairness and cultural sensitivity. We investigate the ethical competence of AI models in NMT, examining the Ethical considerations at each stage of NMT development, including data handling, privacy, data ownership, and consent. We identify and address ethical issues through empirical studies. These include employing Transformer models for Luganda-English translations and enhancing efficiency with sentence mini-batching. And complementary studies that refine data labeling techniques and fine-tune BERT and Longformer models for analyzing Luganda and English social media content. Our second approach is a literature review from databases such as Google Scholar and platforms like GitHub. Additionally, the paper probes the distribution of responsibility between AI systems and humans, underscoring the essential role of human oversight in upholding NMT ethical standards.

Exploring the Mystery of Influential Data for Mathematical Reasoning,"Xinzhe Ni, Yeyun Gong, Zhibin Gou, Yelong Shen, Yujiu Yang, Nan Duan, Weizhu Chen","Selecting influential data for fine-tuning on downstream tasks is a key factor for both performance and computation efficiency. Recent works have shown that training with only limited data can show a superior performance on general tasks. However, the feasibility on mathematical reasoning tasks has not been validated. To go further, there exist two open questions for mathematical reasoning: how to select influential data and what is an influential data composition. For the former one, we propose a Quality-aware Diverse Selection (QaDS) strategy adaptable for mathematical reasoning. A comparison with other selection strategies validates the superiority of QaDS. For the latter one, we first enlarge our setting and explore the influential data composition. We conduct a series of experiments and highlight: scaling up reasoning data, and training with general data selected by QaDS is helpful. Then, we define our optimal mixture as OpenMathMix, an influential data mixture with open-source data selected by QaDS. With OpenMathMix, we achieve a state-of-the-art 48.8% accuracy on MATH with 7B base model. Additionally, we showcase the use of QaDS in creating efficient fine-tuning mixtures with various selection ratios, and analyze the quality of a wide range of open-source datasets, which can perform as a reference for future works on mathematical reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01067v2,2024-04
Regularized Best-of-N Sampling to Mitigate Reward Hacking for Language Model Alignment,"Yuu Jinnai, Tetsuro Morimura, Kaito Ariu, Kenshi Abe","Best-of-N (BoN) sampling with a reward model has been shown to be an effective strategy for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences at the time of decoding. BoN sampling is susceptible to a problem known as reward hacking. Because the reward model is an imperfect proxy for the true objective, over-optimizing its value can compromise its performance on the true objective. A common solution to prevent reward hacking in preference learning techniques is to optimize a reward using proximity regularization (e.g., KL regularization), which ensures that the language model remains close to the reference model. In this research, we propose Regularized Best-of-N (RBoN), a variant of BoN that aims to mitigate reward hacking by incorporating a proximity term in response selection, similar to preference learning techniques. We evaluate RBoN on the AlpacaFarm and Anthropic's hh-rlhf datasets and find that it outperforms BoN. As an application of RBoN, we use RBoN to generate a pairwise preference learning dataset. Experimental results show that a DPO model trained on a dataset generated with RBoN outperforms a DPO model generated with vanilla BoN.

ARAGOG: Advanced RAG Output Grading,"Matouš Eibich, Shivay Nagpal, Alexander Fred-Ojala","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is essential for integrating external knowledge into Large Language Model (LLM) outputs. While the literature on RAG is growing, it primarily focuses on systematic reviews and comparisons of new state-of-the-art (SoTA) techniques against their predecessors, with a gap in extensive experimental comparisons. This study begins to address this gap by assessing various RAG methods' impacts on retrieval precision and answer similarity. We found that Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) and LLM reranking significantly enhance retrieval precision. However, Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Cohere rerank did not exhibit notable advantages over a baseline Naive RAG system, and Multi-query approaches underperformed. Sentence Window Retrieval emerged as the most effective for retrieval precision, despite its variable performance on answer similarity. The study confirms the potential of the Document Summary Index as a competent retrieval approach. All resources related to this research are publicly accessible for further investigation through our GitHub repository ARAGOG (https://github.com/predlico/ARAGOG). We welcome the community to further this exploratory study in RAG systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01037v1,2024-04
Verifying Claims About Metaphors with Large-Scale Automatic Metaphor Identification,"Kotaro Aono, Ryohei Sasano, Koichi Takeda","There are several linguistic claims about situations where words are more likely to be used as metaphors. However, few studies have sought to verify such claims with large corpora. This study entails a large-scale, corpus-based analysis of certain existing claims about verb metaphors, by applying metaphor detection to sentences extracted from Common Crawl and using the statistics obtained from the results. The verification results indicate that the direct objects of verbs used as metaphors tend to have lower degrees of concreteness, imageability, and familiarity, and that metaphors are more likely to be used in emotional and subjective sentences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01029v1,2024-04
Utilizing AI and Social Media Analytics to Discover Adverse Side Effects of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists,"Alon Bartal, Kathleen M. Jagodnik, Nava Pliskin, Abraham Seidmann","Adverse side effects (ASEs) of drugs, revealed after FDA approval, pose a threat to patient safety. To promptly detect overlooked ASEs, we developed a digital health methodology capable of analyzing massive public data from social media, published clinical research, manufacturers' reports, and ChatGPT. We uncovered ASEs associated with the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), a market expected to grow exponentially to $133.5 billion USD by 2030. Using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, our method successfully detected 21 potential ASEs overlooked upon FDA approval, including irritability and numbness. Our data-analytic approach revolutionizes the detection of unreported ASEs associated with newly deployed drugs, leveraging cutting-edge AI-driven social media analytics. It can increase the safety of new drugs in the marketplace by unlocking the power of social media to support regulators and manufacturers in the rapid discovery of hidden ASE risks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01358v1,2024-04
Source-Aware Training Enables Knowledge Attribution in Language Models,"Muhammad Khalifa, David Wadden, Emma Strubell, Honglak Lee, Lu Wang, Iz Beltagy, Hao Peng","Large language models (LLMs) learn a vast amount of knowledge during pretraining, but they are often oblivious to the source(s) of such knowledge. We investigate the problem of intrinsic source citation, where LLMs are required to cite the pretraining source supporting a generated response. Intrinsic source citation can enhance LLM transparency, interpretability, and verifiability. To give LLMs such ability, we explore source-aware training -- a recipe that involves (i) training the LLM to associate unique source document identifiers with the knowledge in each document, followed by (ii) an instruction-tuning stage to teach the LLM to cite a supporting pretraining source when prompted. Source-aware training borrows from existing pretraining/fine-tuning frameworks and requires minimal changes to the model architecture or implementation. Through experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that our training recipe can enable faithful attribution to the pretraining data without a substantial impact on the model's perplexity compared to standard pretraining. Our findings also highlight the importance of pretraining data augmentation in achieving attribution.

PairEval: Open-domain Dialogue Evaluation with Pairwise Comparison,"ChaeHun Park, Minseok Choi, Dohyun Lee, Jaegul Choo","Building a reliable and automated evaluation metric is a necessary but challenging problem for open-domain dialogue systems. Recent studies proposed evaluation metrics that assess generated responses by considering their relevance to previous dialogue histories. Although effective, these metrics evaluate individual responses directly rather than considering their relative quality compared to other responses. To handle this, we propose PairEval, a novel dialogue evaluation metric for assessing responses by comparing their quality against responses in different conversations. PairEval is built on top of open-sourced and moderate-size language models, and we make them specialized in pairwise comparison between dialogue responses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our metric exhibits a higher correlation with human judgments than baseline metrics. We also find that the proposed comparative metric is more robust in detecting common failures from open-domain dialogue systems, including repetition and speaker insensitivity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01015v2,2024-04
Query Performance Prediction using Relevance Judgments Generated by Large Language Models,"Chuan Meng, Negar Arabzadeh, Arian Askari, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Maarten de Rijke","Query performance prediction (QPP) aims to estimate the retrieval quality of a search system for a query without human relevance judgments. Previous QPP methods typically return a single scalar value and do not require the predicted values to approximate a specific information retrieval (IR) evaluation measure, leading to certain drawbacks: (i) a single scalar is insufficient to accurately represent different IR evaluation measures, especially when metrics do not highly correlate, and (ii) a single scalar limits the interpretability of QPP methods because solely using a scalar is insufficient to explain QPP results. To address these issues, we propose a QPP framework using automatically generated relevance judgments (QPP-GenRE), which decomposes QPP into independent subtasks of predicting the relevance of each item in a ranked list to a given query. This allows us to predict any IR evaluation measure using the generated relevance judgments as pseudo-labels. This also allows us to interpret predicted IR evaluation measures, and identify, track and rectify errors in generated relevance judgments to improve QPP quality. We predict an item's relevance by using open-source large language models (LLMs) to ensure scientific reproducibility.   We face two main challenges: (i) excessive computational costs of judging an entire corpus for predicting a metric considering recall, and (ii) limited performance in prompting open-source LLMs in a zero-/few-shot manner. To solve the challenges, we devise an approximation strategy to predict an IR measure considering recall and propose to fine-tune open-source LLMs using human-labeled relevance judgments. Experiments on the TREC 2019-2022 deep learning tracks show that QPP-GenRE achieves state-of-the-art QPP quality for both lexical and neural rankers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01012v2,2024-04

Our goal is to enhance access and utilization of these resources, extending their reach within the country. We explained in a detail the dataset collection process and associated challenges. Additionally, we experimented with translation task using the IBM Model 1 due to data constraints. The result showed that the performance of each language already shows good indications for further development.

What Causes the Failure of Explicit to Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition?,"Wei Liu, Stephen Wan, Michael Strube","We consider an unanswered question in the discourse processing community: why do relation classifiers trained on explicit examples (with connectives removed) perform poorly in real implicit scenarios? Prior work claimed this is due to linguistic dissimilarity between explicit and implicit examples but provided no empirical evidence. In this study, we show that one cause for such failure is a label shift after connectives are eliminated. Specifically, we find that the discourse relations expressed by some explicit instances will change when connectives disappear. Unlike previous work manually analyzing a few examples, we present empirical evidence at the corpus level to prove the existence of such shift. Then, we analyze why label shift occurs by considering factors such as the syntactic role played by connectives, ambiguity of connectives, and more. Finally, we investigate two strategies to mitigate the label shift: filtering out noisy data and joint learning with connectives. Experiments on PDTB 2.0, PDTB 3.0, and the GUM dataset demonstrate that classifiers trained with our strategies outperform strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00999v1,2024-04

We compare the performance of various LLMs and demonstrate that, when using GPT-4, our proposed metric achieves evaluation consistency close to that of radiologists. Furthermore, to reduce costs and improve accessibility, making this method practical, we construct a dataset using LLM evaluation results and perform knowledge distillation to train a smaller model. The distilled model achieves evaluation capabilities comparable to GPT-4. Our framework and distilled model offer an accessible and efficient evaluation method for radiology report generation, facilitating the development of more clinically relevant models.

Prior Constraints-based Reward Model Training for Aligning Large Language Models,"Hang Zhou, Chenglong Wang, Yimin Hu, Tong Xiao, Chunliang Zhang, Jingbo Zhu","Reinforcement learning with human feedback for aligning large language models (LLMs) trains a reward model typically using ranking loss with comparison pairs.However, the training procedure suffers from an inherent problem: the uncontrolled scaling of reward scores during reinforcement learning due to the lack of constraints while training the reward model.This paper proposes a Prior Constraints-based Reward Model (namely PCRM) training method to mitigate this problem. PCRM incorporates prior constraints, specifically, length ratio and cosine similarity between outputs of each comparison pair, during reward model training to regulate optimization magnitude and control score margins. We comprehensively evaluate PCRM by examining its rank correlation with human preferences and its effectiveness in aligning LLMs via RL. Experimental results demonstrate that PCRM significantly improves alignment performance by effectively constraining reward score scaling. As another bonus, our method is easily integrated into arbitrary rank-based alignment methods, such as direct preference optimization, and can yield consistent improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00978v2,2024-04
Efficiently Distilling LLMs for Edge Applications,"Achintya Kundu, Fabian Lim, Aaron Chew, Laura Wynter, Penny Chong, Rhui Dih Lee","Supernet training of LLMs is of great interest in industrial applications as it confers the ability to produce a palette of smaller models at constant cost, regardless of the number of models (of different size / latency) produced. We propose a new method called Multistage Low-rank Fine-tuning of Super-transformers (MLFS) for parameter-efficient supernet training.

Stream of Search (SoS): Learning to Search in Language,"Kanishk Gandhi, Denise Lee, Gabriel Grand, Muxin Liu, Winson Cheng, Archit Sharma, Noah D. Goodman","Language models are rarely shown fruitful mistakes while training. They then struggle to look beyond the next token, suffering from a snowballing of errors and struggling to predict the consequence of their actions several steps ahead. In this paper, we show how language models can be taught to search by representing the process of search in language, as a flattened string -- a stream of search (SoS). We propose a unified language for search that captures an array of different symbolic search strategies. We demonstrate our approach using the simple yet difficult game of Countdown, where the goal is to combine input numbers with arithmetic operations to reach a target number. We pretrain a transformer-based language model from scratch on a dataset of streams of search generated by heuristic solvers. We find that SoS pretraining increases search accuracy by 25% over models trained to predict only the optimal search trajectory. We further finetune this model with two policy improvement methods: Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). The finetuned SoS models solve 36% of previously unsolved problems, including problems that cannot be solved by any of the heuristic solvers. Our results indicate that language models can learn to solve problems via search, self-improve to flexibly use different search strategies, and potentially discover new ones.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03683v1,2024-04

Factuality issue is a critical concern for LLMs, as they may generate factually incorrect responses. In this paper, we propose GraphEval to evaluate an LLM's performance using a substantially large test dataset. Specifically, the test dataset is retrieved from a large knowledge graph with more than 10 million facts without expensive human efforts. Unlike conventional methods that evaluate LLMs based on generated responses, GraphEval streamlines the evaluation process by creating a judge model to estimate the correctness of the answers given by the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that the judge model's factuality assessment aligns closely with the correctness of the LLM's generated outputs, while also substantially reducing evaluation costs. Besides, our findings offer valuable insights into LLM performance across different metrics and highlight the potential for future improvements in ensuring the factual integrity of LLM outputs.

LLaMA-Excitor: General Instruction Tuning via Indirect Feature Interaction,"Bo Zou, Chao Yang, Yu Qiao, Chengbin Quan, Youjian Zhao","Existing methods to fine-tune LLMs, like Adapter, Prefix-tuning, and LoRA, which introduce extra modules or additional input sequences to inject new skills or knowledge, may compromise the innate abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we propose LLaMA-Excitor, a lightweight method that stimulates the LLMs' potential to better follow instructions by gradually paying more attention to worthwhile information. Specifically, the LLaMA-Excitor does not directly change the intermediate hidden state during the self-attention calculation of the transformer structure. We designed the Excitor block as a bypass module for the similarity score computation in LLMs' self-attention to reconstruct keys and change the importance of values by learnable prompts. LLaMA-Excitor ensures a self-adaptive allocation of additional attention to input instructions, thus effectively preserving LLMs' pre-trained knowledge when fine-tuning LLMs on low-quality instruction-following datasets. Furthermore, we unify the modeling of multi-modal tuning and language-only tuning, extending LLaMA-Excitor to a powerful visual instruction follower without the need for complex multi-modal alignment. Our proposed approach is evaluated in language-only and multi-modal tuning experimental scenarios. Notably, LLaMA-Excitor is the only method that maintains basic capabilities while achieving a significant improvement (+6%) on the MMLU benchmark.

In this work, we evaluate the generalization of benchmark datasets to build AI models on cross-cultural Twitter data. We gather a custom geo-located Twitter dataset of depressed users from seven countries as a test dataset. Our results show that depression detection models do not generalize globally.

TM-TREK at SemEval-2024 Task 8: Towards LLM-Based Automatic Boundary Detection for Human-Machine Mixed Text,"Xiaoyan Qu, Xiangfeng Meng","With the increasing prevalence of text generated by large language models (LLMs), there is a growing concern about distinguishing between LLM-generated and human-written texts in order to prevent the misuse of LLMs, such as the dissemination of misleading information and academic dishonesty. Previous research has primarily focused on classifying text as either entirely human-written or LLM-generated, neglecting the detection of mixed texts that contain both types of content. This paper explores LLMs' ability to identify boundaries in human-written and machine-generated mixed texts. We approach this task by transforming it into a token classification problem and regard the label turning point as the boundary. Notably, our ensemble model of LLMs achieved first place in the 'Human-Machine Mixed Text Detection' sub-task of the SemEval'24 Competition Task 8. Additionally, we investigate factors that influence the capability of LLMs in detecting boundaries within mixed texts, including the incorporation of extra layers on top of LLMs, combination of segmentation loss, and the impact of pretraining. Our findings aim to provide valuable insights for future research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00899v1,2024-04
Self-Demos: Eliciting Out-of-Demonstration Generalizability in Large Language Models,"Wei He, Shichun Liu, Jun Zhao, Yiwen Ding, Yi Lu, Zhiheng Xi, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising abilities of in-context learning (ICL), adapting swiftly to new tasks with only few-shot demonstrations. However, current few-shot methods heavily depend on high-quality, query-specific demos, which are often lacking. When faced with out-of-demonstration (OOD) queries, methods that rely on hand-crafted demos or external retrievers might fail. To bridge the gap between limited demos and OOD queries, we propose Self-Demos, a novel prompting method that elicits the inherent generalizability in LLMs by query-aware demo generation. The generated demos strategically interpolate between existing demos and the given query, transforming the query from OOD to ID. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we manually constructed OOD-Toolset, a dataset in the tool-using scenario with over 300 real-world APIs and 1000 instances, each consisting of three tool-use cases as demos and an OOD query. Thorough experiments on our dataset and two public math benchmarks have shown that our method can outperform state-of-the-art baselines in the OOD setting. Moreover, we conduct a range of analyses to validate Self-Demos's generalization and provide more insights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00884v1,2024-04
Bailong: Bilingual Transfer Learning based on QLoRA and Zip-tie Embedding,"Lung-Chuan Chen, Zong-Ru Li","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various NLP applications. However, the majority of existing open-source LLMs are pre-trained primarily on English data and little part of other languages. This deficiency in multilingual training data results in suboptimal performance when applied to languages with fewer available resources. Furthermore, enhancing the performance of LLMs on low-resource languages by full-parameter fine-tuning with additional data requires substantial computational resources, posing computational barriers for research organizations and individual researchers. Consequently, several techniques such as parameter-efficient tuning and advanced embedding initialization have been proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we combine them to facilitate cross-lingual transfer on English-dominated open-source LLM. To effectively enhance the model's proficiency in Traditional Chinese, we conduct secondary pre-training on Llama 2 7B with Traditional Chinese data by leveraging QLoRA and our proposed zip-tie embedding initialization. The resulting model called Bailong, which stands for Bilingual trAnsfer learnIng based on qLOra and zip-tie embeddiNG. We present Bailong-instruct 7B, a fine-tuned version of Bailong 7B optimized for multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Recognizing the inadequacy of benchmark datasets in Traditional Chinese, we further introduce Bailong-bench to assess the alignment of models with human preferences and the capability to follow instructions in both Traditional Chinese and English tasks. In our evaluation, Bailong-instruct 7B exhibits competitive performance on Bailong-bench and other benchmark datasets when compared to other open-source models of similar or even larger parameter sizes. Bailong-instruct 7B and Bailong-bench are publicly available with the aim of empowering the community to build upon our efforts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00862v1,2024-04
Do language models plan ahead for future tokens?,"Wilson Wu, John X. Morris, Lionel Levine","Do transformers ""think ahead"" during inference at a given position? It is known transformers prepare information in the hidden states of the forward pass at time step $t$ that is then used in future forward passes $t+\tau$. We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present during training result in the model computing features at $t$ irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step $t$ are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time $t+\tau$. We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training. In a constructed synthetic data setting, we find clear evidence for pre-caching. In the autoregressive language modeling setting, our experiments are more suggestive of the breadcrumbs hypothesis, though pre-caching increases with model scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00859v2,2024-04
